# GOAL — STARK-KILL: re-derive the hand-rolled Rust STARK engine + its ~45 AIRs from Lean

*(This goal's trail. The repo's `GOAL.md` belongs to the storage-in-lean lane — do NOT
touch it. Full plan: `docs/deos/LEGACY-STARK-DELETION-SCOPE.md`.)*

## The mission
Kill `circuit/src/stark.rs` (the O(n²) hand engine) + ~45 hand-authored Rust AIRs by
EMITTING every circuit from Lean as a byte-pinned `EffectVmDescriptor2` on the p3 IR2
prover (law #1). Then climb the semantic ladder as high as it goes — Rung 1 (functional
refinement) AND Rung 2 (semantic no-forgery) for EVERY family, Rung 3 (fold → light-client
verifiable) where there's a consumer, and beyond (cross-circuit composition + assurance-case
apex). Done = engine + AIRs deleted, every survivor Lean-emitted + Rung-1&2-proven.

## ⚑ WIRE-MIGRATION MAP (2026-07-07, "Grind it down" — ember lifted the hold + gave the phrase)
CUTOVER SURFACE LANDED (84 files, workspace-green, committed) → 35→**20** prod stark refs remain.
The 20 are the coupled wire-migration. WIRE SHAPE (grounded): predicate blobs (`cell/src/predicate.rs`
`WitnessedPredicate`, a small descriptor + `proof_idx` into a proof-witness table) carry a serialized
**`StarkProof`** (hand engine); TARGET = **`Ir2BatchProof`** (= `p3_batch_stark::BatchProof`, the return
of `prove_vm_descriptor2` at `descriptor_ir2.rs:4904`). Migrate producer→table→consumer in LOCKSTEP.
The 20, by cluster:
- **bridge** (present.rs producer + verifier.rs consumer) — SELF-CONTAINED, the PATHFINDER (build-gate just bridge).
- **turn** (action, aggregate_bilateral_prover, binding_proof, conditional, executor/apply, executor/membership_verifier) — the deep-prover core.
- **sdk** (cipherclerk, privacy, verify) · **chain** (main, lib, prove) · **cell/predicate.rs** (the blob table).
- **wasm** (lib, privacy) — SOFT wall (wasm already pulls p3 in its dep graph; a rewire, not a new prover).
- misc: wire/server.rs, storage/blinded.rs, circuit/examples/fri_from_scratch.rs (example — delete/migrate).
TWO descriptor-generalizations needed first: variable-depth membership (emit is depth-2), delegation-scope (no emit).
ORDER: bridge pathfinder → generalize membership → turn cluster → sdk/chain → cell blob table → wasm → delete hand AIRs → `git rm stark.rs` when grep==0.
NOTE: breaking old serialized StarkProof blobs is ACCEPTABLE (VK-epoch flip is a fresh-genesis act anyway).

### ⚑ REFINED PLAN (scout-mapped 2026-07-07, agent a9f1579a — supersedes the rough order above)
**PREMISE CORRECTED: the seam is OPAQUE `Vec<u8>` (witness_blobs table + `proof_bytes: &[u8]`), NOT a
typed StarkProof.** So `cargo build` catches only the ~9 TYPED sites; the byte-format flips + the
runtime AIR-name string dispatch are COMPILER-INVISIBLE. A big-bang builds green and fails at
RUNTIME. → runtime validation is mandatory, not optional.
FALSE POSITIVES (already done): `turn/aggregate_bilateral_prover.rs` (already Ir2BatchProof),
`turn/binding_proof.rs` (only hashes bytes) → **18 real files, not 20**.
- **PedersenEquality** predicate is genuinely off-STARK (Schnorr) — NO migration, NO descriptor.
- **Delegation descriptor ALREADY EMITTED** (EffectVmEmitDelegate/Atten/Refresh/Revoke) — the gap is
  only the Rust leg (`turn/action.rs:650 verify_stark_delegation_binding` does PI-binding + a
  cfg-gated v1 AIR being deleted; make it a full `verify_vm_descriptor2`).
- **Variable-depth membership = the ONE real descriptor-gen.** Emit is depth-2; production
  `prove_membership_dsl` is var-depth; executor PADS to depth-2 today (`membership_verifier.rs:865`).
  Plan: Rust runtime-parameterize depth for the cutover (viable, `check_descriptor2` gates
  well-formedness); Rung-2 proof stays depth-2 → OPEN a Lean lane to lift it (honest gap, don't block).
- **THE #1 DANGER: `circuit_for_air_name`** (runtime string→circuit dispatch, `descriptors.rs:686`) has
  NO descriptor-world equivalent (only a TEST-only registry). Must BUILD a production `descriptor_by_name`.
- **3 serialization dialects**: postcard (executor seam), serde_json (wasm), bincode (SP1 guest) — format
  mismatch = silent decode-fail→false.
- **SP1 chain leg** (`chain/program` RISC-V binary, hand-mirrored `GuestStarkProof` via bincode) — FENCE
  OFF, migrate as its own later gate; a Gate-2 format flip silently breaks the EVM-wrap. (Its guest struct
  is a SEPARATE copy, so fencing does NOT block `git rm circuit/src/stark.rs`.)
**GATES (2 build + 1 runtime, foundation-first):**
- GATE 1 (circuit + circuit-prove, fast per-crate): build `descriptor_by_name` production dispatch +
  variable-depth membership descriptor. These change signatures everything downstream needs.
- GATE 2 (one coordinated edit, `cargo check --workspace` iterate → one `cargo build --workspace`):
  migrate all 18 sites against Gate-1 foundations. Compiler catches ~9; MANUALLY handle the byte-opaque
  encoders + air_name call-sites. wasm rides along (deferrable sub-lane). SP1 FENCED.
- GATE 3 (runtime, mandatory): integration run — executor membership/adjacency discharge, bridge
  present→verify round-trip, wasm serde_json, SP1 decode (or confirm fenced).

### ⚑ EMBER DECISIONS (2026-07-07) + EXECUTION STATUS
- SP1/EVM-wrap: **DELETE, rebuild later** (not fence). ✅ DONE — Gate 0: `git rm -r chain/` (332MB,
  leaf crate, 0 dependents; removes the bincode hazard + 3 files). Prod stark refs 20→17.
- Variable-depth membership: **do depth-general as GROUNDWORK** (not a depth-2 pad hack). → Gate 1.
- Breaks: **ALL breaks OK — discarding all pre-persisted things.** Full green light on serialization.
- GATE 1 RUNNING (workflow wf_67644971-9b9): production `descriptor_by_name` dispatch (the #1-danger
  air-name→descriptor analog) + depth-general membership descriptor builder. Round-trip-gated
  (name→desc→prove→verify per kind; depth-{2,4,8}), adversarially verified. On CONFIRMED: verify on my
  tree + commit, then Gate 2 (the coordinated ~15-site consumer swap).
- ✅ GATE 1 LANDED (commit pending-hash): `descriptor_by_name` (fail-closed dispatch, 9 goldens) +
  `membership_descriptor_of_depth` (genuinely var-depth, depth-8-load-bearing proven). 19 tests green
  on my tree, adversarially CONFIRMED. Residual: Rung-2 depth-general Lean lift (named follow-on).
- GATE 2 NEXT: coordinated swap of the 15 consumer sites (scout §2/§3 map) onto descriptor_by_name +
  the foundations. cargo check --workspace iterate → one build → Gate 3 runtime validation.
- ⚑ GATE 2 ATTEMPT (wf_7679d0c8) RETURNED PARTIAL — flipped ZERO prod sites by a SOUND judgment call,
  and REFUTED the scout's "one coordinated edit" optimism with 4 real foundation gaps (a "Gate 1.5"):
  1. **membership arity mismatch**: Gate-1 depth-general descriptor is BINARY (arity-2); production
     membership (`membership_verifier.rs` + ~8 app crates via registry_with_real_verifiers) is 4-ARY.
     Flipping changes every committed root + is FAIL-OPEN if wrong. → need a 4-ary depth-general variant
     to MATCH production (fresh-genesis lets us break roots, but the executor+apps must move together +
     run the app suites). **DECISION: match production arity (4-ary), don't force apps to binary.**
  2. **bridge `ProofVerifier` trait carries no predicate identity** (`verify(proof,action,resource,vk)`)
     → can't call descriptor_by_name(predicate_name); needs a trait-signature change (dregg-turn, ripples).
  3. **delegate descriptors are v1 parse_descriptor, NOT IR-v2** (scout was wrong) — delegation needs a
     new IR-v2 delegate EffectVmDescriptor2 + a descriptor_by_name arm before action.rs can migrate.
  4. **adjacency has no descriptor-witness builder** (only `membership_witness`) — needs one.
  DELIVERED: the Gate-3 runtime harness (turn/tests/stark_kill_wire_roundtrip.rs, 5 green) validating the
  consumer contract end-to-end. RESHAPED PLAN: **Gate 1.5** (close the 4 gaps: 4-ary depth-general
  membership + adjacency witness + IR-v2 delegate descriptor + the ProofVerifier trait threading predicate
  identity) → **Gate 2** (now-mechanical site flips against complete foundations, per-CLUSTER runtime-gated:
  bridge, turn-executor+8-apps, sdk, wire/storage, wasm). The membership cluster is the fail-open risk —
  do it its own cluster with the app suites run.
- ⚑ ARITY DECISION (ember "brave, 4-ary to match production"): production membership is 4-ARY
  (hash_4_to_1, siblings:&[[BabyBear;3]] = 3 sibs + node). Gate-1's depth-general was BINARY. →
  build a 4-ary variant whose root is BYTE-EQUAL to the production hash_4_to_1 root (apps don't move).
- GATE 1.5 RUNNING (wf_47cf9430-923): 2 lanes — (circuit) 4-ary depth-general membership +
  adjacency witness builder + IR-v2 delegate descriptor; (trait) thread predicate identity through
  ProofVerifier so descriptor_by_name is callable. Root-equality-gated + adversarially verified.

## Current thrust — PARKED at a clean milestone (ember hold, 2026-07-07)
**Rung 0 + Rung 1 + Rung 2 ALL COMPLETE and committed.** Every one of the ~20 emitted
circuits is Lean-emitted, byte-pinned, functionally refined (Rung 1), AND no-forgery proven
(Rung 2): 10 DONE_AT_RUNG1 + 5 full Rung-2 (note_spending/quantified_absence/temporal/garbled/
effect_action) + DFA template + 4 honest PARTIAL. predicates-arithmetic → DONE_AT_RUNG1.
REMAINING (both HELD for the free tree / a fresh session):
- push the 4 honest PARTIALs → full (ivc, predicates-relational-compound, revocation are
  crypto-dischargeable additive proof; membership needs the emit-fix);
- Phase 2b CUTOVER (ember-confirm-gated) — the perf win + the Rust deletion.

## ⚑ EMBER DECISION (2026-07-07): Phase 2b is HELD
The CUTOVER (rewire 55 live `stark::prove` consumers onto `prove_vm_descriptor2` + delete the
hand AIRs + `git rm stark.rs`) — where the perf win lands + the unverified Rust dies — is
HELD until the tree is free of the other concurrent `/goal` lanes ("it won't be long before
the tree is free and ours"). Do NOT auto-fire it when the tree clears — CONFIRM with ember
first (it deletes deployed code, irreversible-ish). Same hold on the membership emit-fix
(byte-golden change). SAFE meanwhile: finish Rung 2 (pred-arith), push honest partials → full
(additive proof only). Preference when it goes: INCREMENTAL, one consumer family at a time,
whole-tree-build-gated, with a before/after perf benchmark wired into the first cutover.

## Next moves (both Rung-2 templates now committed; the rest is gated/polish)
- DONE: `DfaRoutingRung2` (hterm discharged via `route_commitment_binds_trace` + `CollisionFree`,
  cheatTrace necessity witness) — committed `87b5e8ec4`. `BilateralAggregationRung2`
  (no-double-spend, structural/carrier-free, cheat_double_spend necessity witness) —
  hand-verified + committed 2026-07-07 (workflows were killed by a process restart before
  recording verdicts; I'm the integration gate, verified on my own tree).
- ~~SAFE / additive: push the 3 Rung-2 PARTIALs → full (crypto-dischargeable)~~ **REFUTED
  2026-07-07 (workflow wf_40ec9ac2-272).** All 3 are EMIT-FIXES, not crypto-dischargeable:
  · **predicates-relational-compound → a FORMALLY PROVEN soundness gap** (committed
    `PredicatesRelationalCompoundRung2.lean` §5b, `fg_accepts_unequal_committed`): the `diff`
    column is never tied to `value_a − value_b`, so a Satisfied2 EQ proof accepts UNEQUAL
    committed values — in BOTH the emit AND the deployed Rust hand-AIR. The campaign's 2nd real
    deployed-circuit bug (cf. membership ordering gap `0f8d478b2`). CLOSE = in-AIR gate
    `diff = value_a − value_b` (emit-fix, byte-golden, HELD).
  · **ivc**: residuals are the two inter-row transition gates (`IvcContinuity`/`IvcStepIncrement`)
    the deployed StateTransitionAir OMITS for padding-safety — emit-fix, not a proof.
  · **revocation**: `DiffLowerRangeSound` (the strict-lower ordering bound) is re-assumed, not
    forced by the descriptor — emit-fix (a range gate).
  So the remaining Rung-2 partials are all downstream of the HELD emit-fixes (byte-golden), which
  ride Phase 2b. Nothing further is both safe-additive AND authorized until the cutover opens.
- HELD (ember-gated, confirm first): Phase 2b cutover (16 prod files still call hand
  `stark::prove`; rewire → `prove_vm_descriptor2` + delete hand AIRs + `git rm stark.rs`) and
  the membership emit-fix (byte-golden). Wait for the free tree + ember confirm; go INCREMENTAL,
  whole-tree-build-gated, perf-benchmarked.

## ⚑ Model-found finding (worth a fix, not a Rung-2 item)
The membership Rung-1 PARTIAL surfaced a REAL DSL→IR-v2 drift: `AdjacencyMembershipEmit`
maps the child-ordering gates to `.base (.gate …)`, which `holdsVm` makes VACUOUS on the
LAST row (when_transition). The deployed DSL (`dsl_plonky3.rs:225/240`) lowers them as
every-row `assert_zero` — so the emit UNDER-constrains the last Merkle level vs the hand AIR.
Fix = re-emit those ordering gates as an every-row IR-v2 form (moves the byte-golden + gate
test). Upgrades membership PARTIAL → full; same class may touch note_spending's Merkle fold.
Surfaced by the refinement proof itself — exactly what Rung 1 is for.

## Done-log
- Rung 0 (emit + real-prover gate) landed for all 20 families — `9c440d208` (+ merkle
  pathfinder `d7d3348fa`). Verified on my tree: 20 emit modules build, 21 gate tests pass.
- Rung 1 DFA bridge landed — `DfaRoutingRefine.lean` (`dfaRouting_refines_classify` +
  unconditional `dfaRouting_genuine_prefix`). Adversarially CONFIRMED non-vacuous,
  axiom-clean. Honest PARTIAL: `hterm` terminal-step = the first Rung-2 target.
- Scope doc + refinement ladder committed — `6716a3dcb`.
- Rung-1 swarm (other 20 families) resumed after a session-limit zombie — `w2hvgi0r4`
  (8 emits cached, remainder + all verifies re-running).
- Rung 1 — 16 whole-descriptor bridges landed + committed (verified on my tree, lake 3024
  jobs, adversarially CONFIRMED, non-vacuous, axiom-clean; bridge_action reaches IFF).
  13 GREEN + 3 honest PARTIAL (membership/note_spending/non_revocation residuals = Rung-2
  targets). Total Rung 1 = 17/20 (incl DFA). HELD unverified: multi_step + presentation
  (refute died on limit); temporal + garbled (refine died) — resume when limit resets.

- MEMBERSHIP SOUNDNESS GAP CLOSED (coordinated 4-file fix): the top-level ordering under-constraint
  the refinement proof caught is fixed (adjLastOrderFix, every-row enforcement); membership Rung-2 now
  FULL/unconditional. Verified my tree (3 Lean + 9 gate tests incl forged_top_level_ordering_refuses).

- ASSURANCE partials→full swarm (wf_31b63f12-9c7): all 3 STILL_PARTIAL, HONESTLY — ivc + revocation
  residuals are EMIT-LEVEL gaps (same class as membership: transition gates vacuous on last row → need
  every-row boundaries); predicates-relational already discharges its crypto slice. DEFERRED as polish
  (descriptors are Rung-1-full + honest-Rung-2-partial = correct); the CUTOVER is the priority, not this.

- ⚡ CUTOVER #1 LANDED + the PERF NUMBER (the loop-closer): zkOracle injection leg OFF stark.rs onto
  prove_vm_descriptor2. MEASURED 1KB 19.37s→1.87s = **10.4×**; 8KB 15.5s (was ~20min, ~80×). O(n log n)
  plonky3 replaces O(n²) hand engine. New DfaRoutingGeneralEmit.lean, grep stark==0, 42 tests green.
  Committed. This is the first consumer dead + proof the whole campaign's premise pays off.

- CUTOVER SWARM mapped the kill: 7 crates went stark-CLEAN (dsl-tests, demo-agent, tests, node,
  dsl-runtime, circuit, circuit-prove) — core crates BUILD GREEN together (1m54s). The deep provers
  (turn/sdk/bridge/misc, ~27 refs) are BLOCKED on a coordinated StarkProof→BatchProof WIRE MIGRATION:
  each carries hand-StarkProof in a serialized blob (cell predicate blobs, proof_bytes) that producer+
  consumer must switch in lockstep; + variable-depth membership descriptor + a NEW delegation-scope
  descriptor + wasm carve-out. That wire migration is the real remaining CAMPAIGN (not one swarm).
  Cutover working-tree changes build green; commit deferred to the wire-migration pass.

## Phase 2b — THE CUTOVER (ember approved 2026-07-07, "stark.rs dead ASAP")
Reality (grounded): ~35 real consumers + ~46 test/bench. TWO WALLS: (1) emitted descriptors
are MINIMAL INSTANCES (dfaRoutingDesc hardcodes the toggle transition; membership is depth-2)
→ each consumer needs its descriptor GENERALIZED to production shape (table-committed / var-depth)
before rewire; (2) WASM proves in-browser on `stark::MerkleStarkAir` (wasm/src/lib.rs:268) →
gates the final `rm` on a wasm-fittable prover (ember Option-A decision, pending). The seL4
`stark_core/stark.rs` ×2 are VENDORED copies, decoupled — NOT blockers.
PLAN: generalize-then-rewire, per consumer-family, whole-tree-build-gated + benchmarked.
- PATHFINDER (running, agent): zk_leg.rs — emit a GENERAL table-committed DFA descriptor,
  rewire off stark::try_prove onto prove_vm_descriptor2, measure before/after. Proves the
  pattern + the perf number. Then swarm the rest by family.
- kill order: (a) test/bench surface (delete/migrate to emit gate tests) · (b) rewire prod
  consumers per family (generalize descriptor + producer) · (c) delete hand AIRs · (d) wasm
  decision · (e) git rm stark.rs when grep circuit::stark (non-vendored prod) == 0.

## ⚑ GATE 1.5 COMPLETE (2026-07-07) — foundations done, Gate 2 unblocked
All 4 gaps closed + committed (7e103edd2 trait, 3a65bb285 circuit), verified on my tree:
4-ary membership (root byte-equal to production, 6 tests) · adjacency witness (3) · IR-v2
delegate descriptor (4) · ProofVerifier::verify_with_predicate + DescriptorDispatchVerifier.
The adversarial verify CAUGHT the trait impl shipping a red test as green → corrected honestly.
NAMED RESIDUAL: Rung-2 depth-general soundness lift (depth is a name/VK label; the path is
root-bound via Poseidon2 CR; production is depth-2 → no regression; in-circuit depth-binding is
a Lean follow-on, NOT a migration blocker).
NEXT = GATE 2: flip the ~15 consumer sites against the now-complete foundations, per-cluster
runtime-gated (bridge · turn-executor+~8-apps [fail-open, run app suites] · sdk · wire/storage ·
wasm) → delete hand AIRs → git rm circuit/src/stark.rs.

## ⚑ DEPTH RESIDUAL CLOSED BY PROOF (2026-07-07, background Lean lane)
MembershipDepthGeneralRung2.lean (committed, lake green, axiom-clean): membership_depth_general_sound
— accept at ANY nominal depth + same committed root ⟹ same leaf/siblings/actual-depth (root binds
the path). REAL FINDING: CR alone does NOT suffice — cross-depth needs a 2nd carrier LeafNodeSep
(leaf/node domain separation, the Merkle depth-extension guard). The deployed Poseidon2 SATISFIES it
(poseidon2.rs:618 leaf-domain-sep). So depth-nominal is SOUND-BY-PROOF (2 named+realized carriers),
not just argued. Residual: mirror a per-depth emit descriptor to metatheory for the SAT⟹SEM lift at
actual height (additive follow-on; the functional-model soundness here governs it).

## ⚑ GATE 2 RESULT + THE REAL REMAINING SCOPE (2026-07-08, this instance OWNS the finish; others parked)
Gate-2 cluster workflow: 4/7 CONFIRMED + committed (via a broad "checkpoint commit" 4b19931b8 by a
concurrent instance — ref 17→14, HEAD builds green): bridge, turn-membership, turn-conditional-delegation,
wasm. The 3 BLOCKED (sdk, wire-storage, turn-executor-misc) validated the factoring: self-contained
producer+consumer PAIRS complete; thin consumers whose producers are elsewhere block.
⚑ DEEPER FINDING (the real gate): the blocked consumers are NOT just call-swaps. Each remaining
predicate family needs a DESCRIPTOR-WITNESS BUILDER (the Gate-1.5 pattern: a Rust fn producing a trace
that matches the EMITTED descriptor, since hand-DSL-circuit trace layout ≠ emitted-descriptor layout).
The confirmed clusters worked ONLY because membership got membership_witness_4ary in Gate 1.5.
  HAVE builders: membership, adjacency, delegate.
  MISSING (blocks the flip): non_revocation (sdk/privacy prove_not_revoked+verify), note_spend
    (storage/blinded), blinded-presentation (sdk verify_anonymous + wire/server + the bridge issuer path),
    predicate-arith (turn/executor/apply predicate leg).
REMAINING = per family {non-rev, note-spend, blinded-presentation, predicate-arith}: (a) build the
descriptor-witness builder [SELF-CONTAINED foundation, agent-able Gate-1.5 style, root/trace byte-match
gated] → (b) flip producer+consumer [COUPLED, main-loop, runtime-gated] → commit. Then strip additive
bridge residue + delete hand AIRs → git rm circuit/src/stark.rs. This is ~4 increments, not one turn.
The 14 refs also include comment-only/false-positives (aggregate_bilateral already Ir2, binding_proof
hashes-only, fri_from_scratch a self-contained example) that need no flip.

## ⚑⚑ REORIENTATION (2026-07-08, ember): ASSURANCE FIRST — the flip is GATED on argus-grade correctness
ember: "major bugs in the old Rust AIRs we ported over... carefully audit the new Lean for correctness
and expand our proofs; the assurance story vs primary argus is not very good." CORRECT — and the 3 bugs
we found (relational diff-unbound / membership ordering / non-rev forgery) are EVIDENCE: all found by
proving Rung-2 adversarially, all the SAME class (descriptor accepts a witness that doesn't satisfy the
intended semantic relation — a free column / missing gate; byte-identity does NOT catch it).
CENSUS (ground truth): assurance is UNEVEN — Rung-2 THIN on MembershipDepthGeneral(3)/NoteSpendingLeaf(5)/
GarbledEval(5)/EffectActionBinding(5); Rung-2 ABSENT on BridgeAction/CommittedThreshold/Derivation/Fold/
MerkleMembership/MultiStepChain/PredicatesArithmetic/Presentation; NONE tied into AssuranceCase.lean /
the argus adversary machinery (CoinductiveAdversary/CTLLiveness/Temporal).
NEW THRUST (supersedes flip-and-delete as the priority): (1) adversarial correctness AUDIT of every
security-critical emitted family, hunting the found-bug class [RUNNING wf_1b09d713-b46]; (2) Rung-2
COMPLETION — every family a real no-forgery proof w/ genuine cheat-witnesses, deepen the thin; (3) tie
the emitted descriptors into AssuranceCase.lean (argus citizens, not islands).
⚑ THE FLIP/DELETE IS NOW GATED: do NOT flip consumers onto a descriptor until it is audited-correct +
Rung-2-full. Replacing known-buggy Rust with unaudited Lean is a lateral move. The Gate-1.6 witness
builders (wrwj5nf6q) may finish (additive, needed post-audit) but the consumer flips WAIT on assurance.

## ⚑ UN-GATE (2026-07-08, ember): deletion and audit are ORTHOGONAL — DELETE FAST
ember: "we don't need to wait for that audit to rip out stark.rs / continue the purge. The new ones are
always going to be better than the old ones, and the faster we delete the old files the less confused
everything is." CORRECT — I over-gated. The new Lean-emitted descriptors are the go-forward path
REGARDLESS of the audit (byte-pinned + some proofs vs the old's zero-proofs + confirmed bugs); keeping
the old buggy Rust around is pure confusion. Any bug the audit finds is fixed IN THE LEAN EMIT, which
the deletion does not foreclose — it CLARIFIES (one impl to harden, not two).
CORRECTED THRUST: (a) CONTINUE the purge — finish the consumer flips (builders now exist), delete the
hand AIRs, git rm circuit/src/stark.rs. (b) The assurance audit (wf_1b09d713-b46) runs IN PARALLEL as
forward correctness on the KEPT Lean (Rung-2 completion + argus-case tie-in) — NOT a gate on deletion.

## ⚑⚑⚑ THE AUDIT PAID OFF (2026-07-08): 7 CONFIRMED forgery bugs in the emitted descriptors — 1 a REGRESSION
The assurance audit (wf_1b09d713-b46, 15 families) found the found-bug class is SYSTEMIC:
CONFIRMED_BUG (7): MerkleMembership, AdjacencyMembership, NonRevocation, NoteSpendingLeaf,
  PredicatesRelationalCompound, Derivation, Fold. SUSPECTED (3): GarbledEval, Presentation,
  CommittedThreshold. LOOKS_SOUND (4): DfaRouting, QuantifiedAbsence, TemporalPredicate, BridgeAction.
  (PredicatesArithmetic: suspected→REFUTED, sound.)
THE CLASS (nearly all of them): a semantic-binding constraint emitted as `.base (.gate body)` =
when_transition, VACUOUS on the last row (holdsVm .gate isLast=true = True) → a witness column FREE on
the last row (or a height-1 trace) → forgery. ⚑ AdjacencyMembership is a REGRESSION: the deployed RUST
AIR binds idx-step every row (assert_zero, is_transition=false) but the Lean EMIT dropped it — so
byte-identity was FAITHFULLY PORTING A HOLE THE RUST DIDN'T HAVE. This REFUTES "new is always better"
for these families and vindicates ember's audit-first instinct: byte-identity ≠ correctness; only
adversarial no-forgery proofs catch this.
FIX SWARM RUNNING (wf_be002563-213, ember "swarm fixes, improve the code + proof strategy"): per family
— add the every-row/last-row binding (the adjLastOrderFix precedent, match/exceed the deployed Rust),
regen the golden, PROVE the exact found-bug witness now UNSAT (regression), + PROOF-STRATEGY UPGRADE:
sweep the whole descriptor for sibling vacuous-.gate constraints.
⚑ META-LESSON (proof strategy): the `.gate` (transition-only) lowering of a semantic-binding constraint
is a SYSTEMATIC TRAP. Standing fix: every Rung-2 proof must construct the height-1/last-row cheat
witness and prove it UNSAT; consider a Lean lint flagging any semantic `.gate` without a last-row
counterpart. The consumer flips REMAIN GATED on their family's descriptor being FIXED (not just the
earlier audit — a fixed descriptor).

## ⚑ BUGFIX HARVEST + THE OOM LESSON (2026-07-08)
⚠ CAUSE OF DEATH: the 10-lane fix swarm ran ~10 concurrent `lake build`s → memory exploded →
HARD REBOOT (killed both the fix swarm + the final-flips workflow). STANDING RULE: NO concurrent
Lean-building swarms. Lean work is SEQUENTIAL main-loop, LEAN_NUM_THREADS capped. (The Rust flip
swarms are fine; it is Lean/lake concurrency that OOMs.)
HARVESTED (on-disk edits survived the reboot; verified sequentially, memory-capped):
- ✅ COMMITTED 3/10 (afb97de45), build-green + axiom-clean + real ¬Satisfied2 forge-reject:
  AdjacencyMembership (the REGRESSION — idx-step now every-row; fTrace/cTraceBad reject),
  NonRevocation (SIB1 bound; both poles prefix_carriers_admitted_forgery→fixed_forbids_the_forgery),
  NoteSpendingLeaf (merkle chain bound; broken_chain/wrong_root reject).
- ⚠ HELD 7/10 (on-disk, UNCOMMITTED, need sequential finishing — NOT a swarm):
  · GarbledEval — has sorryAx (faked-green in garbled_lastRowFix_load_bearing); discharge the sorry.
  · Derivation — NOTHING on disk (lane died early); redo from the audit dossier (bodyHash cols 1..8 free).
  · MerkleMembership — fix present, THIN regression (CUR1 height-1 hole); complete the forge-reject proof.
  · PredicatesRelationalCompound — fix present, thin regression (and_intermediate free); complete.
  · Fold — fix present (REMOVAL_COUNT_PLUS_ONE free); build-verify + complete regression.
  · Presentation — fix present, NO regression (NOT_AFTER free); author the forge-reject.
  · CommittedThreshold — fix present, thin (FACT_COMMITMENT tautological pin); complete.
  Audit dossiers: /private/tmp/.../scratchpad/bugfix-seeds.json. Both swarms resumable by runId but
  DO NOT resume as concurrent Lean swarms — finish sequentially.
- final-flips (wf_0438144d-602) also OOM-died with consumer-crate edits on disk (uncommitted, GATED
  on the descriptors being fixed — do not commit until the 7 held fixes land).

## ⚑⚑ LEAN TRACTABILITY DISCIPLINE (2026-07-08) — the 80GB-per-process bug
ember: individual lean processes hit 80GB+ (NOT concurrency) → hard reboot. CAUSE: fix-lanes wrote
`#guard decide (…)` / `by decide` over HEAVY computation — Poly.eval over BabyBear field arithmetic and
26KB emitVmJson2 descriptor structures. `decide` forces the KERNEL to fully reduce the Decidable
instance → materializes enormous terms → 80GB. (Adjacency/NonRev/NoteSpend built fine: their decides
were small structural props.)
STANDING RULES:
1. NEVER `decide`/`native_decide` on heavy computation (emitVmJson2, descriptor structs, Poly.eval over
   field elements). Use COMPILED `#guard (a == b)` (a Bool, run by the compiler NOT the kernel) or `#eval`
   or a structural simp/rfl proof. `decide` is ONLY for small finite props that reduce trivially.
   FIX PATTERN: `#guard decide (X = 0)` → `#guard (X == 0)`.
2. EVERY build memory-capped: run via `.bin/lean-safe lake build …` (CAP_GB=12, RSS watchdog kills a
   runaway lean/lake before it reboots the box). NEVER a bare unbounded lake build.
3. Tractability review BEFORE build — a `#guard decide(bigterm)` / `by decide` over field arith is a
   red flag caught by READING, not at reboot.
