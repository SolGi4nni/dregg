//! Cordial Miners total ordering (the tau function).
//!
//! Implements the consensus ordering from the Cordial Miners paper (arXiv:2205.09174).
//! The blocklace is divided into **waves** of fixed wavelength. Each wave has a
//! designated **leader** (round-robin). When the leader's block is **super-ratified**
//! by a supermajority chain at the wave's end, it becomes a final leader and
//! anchors a segment of the total order.
//!
//! The `tau` function (CM Def. 6 / Alg. 2:32,35,37,41–46) takes ONE head — the
//! DEEPEST final leader (`last_final_leader()`, Alg. 2:44–46) — and recurses
//! BACKWARD through `previous_ratified_leader` (Alg. 2:41–43), producing an
//! anchor chain `[b₁, …, b_k = head]`. Folding that chain left to right, each
//! anchor `l` contributes `xsort(l, [l] \ [prev])`: the blocks of the anchor's
//! OWN inclusive causal past `[l]` that the previous anchor's closure did not
//! already cover. **Finality is consulted exactly once — choosing the head — and
//! nowhere in the recursion** (CM Def. 6: "when τ′ is called with a leader b, it
//! makes a recursive call with a leader ratified by b, which is not necessarily
//! super-ratified").
//!
//! That single structural fact is what makes the history append-only. The
//! previous rule folded over `find_all_final_leaders` and gave each anchor a
//! *coverage* = the union of the causal pasts of every wave-END block **in the
//! live lace** that ratified it — a strict superset of `[anchor]` that GREW WITH
//! ARRIVALS, so a late honest wave-end ratifier for an already-final wave spliced
//! blocks MID-PREFIX. A closure is fixed forever by the anchor's own signed hash
//! pointers, so the new segments cannot move. The price is CM's real latency: a
//! block at round `r` is ordered by the first final leader that OBSERVES it,
//! which is at a strictly greater round — never by a ratifier at its own wave's
//! end. On a 3-round / one-wave lace `tau` therefore emits exactly the anchor.
//!
//! # Key Definitions
//!
//! - **Round**: the depth of a block in the DAG (longest path from any genesis).
//!   Genesis blocks are at round 1.
//! - **Wave**: a group of `wavelength` consecutive rounds. Wave 0 = rounds [1, w].
//! - **Leader**: the designated block creator for a wave (round-robin by index).
//! - **Approval**: block `b` approves leader `l` if `l` is in `b`'s causal past
//!   and no equivocation by `l.creator` is visible from `b`.
//! - **Ratification**: block `b` ratifies leader `l` if a supermajority of
//!   participants have blocks in `b`'s causal past that approve `l`.
//! - **Super-ratification**: a supermajority of blocks at the wave's last round
//!   ratify the leader.

// CM's τ does NOT fold over "every final leader in the live lace". It takes ONE head — the deepest
// final leader (`last_final_leader()`, Alg. 2:44–46) — and recurses backward through
// `previous_ratified_leader` (Alg. 2:41–43), a walk quantified entirely over the ANCHOR'S OWN
// CLOSURE `[b1]`:
//
//     41: procedure previous_ratified_leader(b1):
//     42:    return arg_{b∈R} max depth(b)
//     43:    where R = {b ∈ [b1] \ {b1} : b.creator = leader(depth(b)) ∧ ratifies([b1], b)}

// ⚑ CLOSURE-LOCALITY IN RUST. The Lean model evaluates depths, `approves`/`ratifies` and the
// equivocation guard against `closureLace B l.id` — the sub-lace induced by the anchor's inclusive
// causal past. Here the equivalent is: every read is restricted to that past, which is what these
// functions do (the candidate set is `causal_past_inclusive(b1)`, and `ratifies` with `b1` as the
// OBSERVER already ranges over exactly `[b1]`). Two facts make a second, closure-local round map
// unnecessary:
//   * `compute_rounds` over the closure gives the SAME depths as over the whole lace whenever the
//     lace is predecessor-closed, which the admission path guarantees
//     (`Blocklace::insert` rejects with `InsertError::MissingPredecessors`); and
//   * `EquivocationIndex` is queried as "≥2 members of a conflicting-block group lie in `past`",
//     and `past ⊆ closure`, so restricting the index to the closure cannot change the answer.

///
/// `tau` is the FEDERATION ordering: one reference group, whose participant set the node reads
/// from the constitution each poll, over a lace that is supposed to hold only that group's blocks.
/// `tau_unified` is the UNIFIED-LACE ordering: several `ReferenceGroup`s coexisting as VIEWS over
/// one shared DAG, each finalizing its own strands and ignoring everyone else's. They are not two
/// implementations of one rule — `tau` has one participant set and no notion of an outsider,
/// `tau_unified` is parameterised by which view you are asking about. Neither replaces the other.
///
/// What DID change (the enrollment repairs, in two rounds): `tau`'s docstring used to carry
/// "assumes all blocks belong to participants" as an unchecked PRECONDITION, and the live path
/// cannot honour it — the pinned-ingest roster is insert-only while the constitution's participant
/// set shrinks, and the restart restore (`finality.rs::from_checkpoint`, authenticating since
/// 2026-08-08) reloads the persisted DAG with no ROSTER check. So `tau` enforces items (4) and (5)
/// below for itself:
///   * (5), the OUTPUT filter, closed by `enrolledId` / the `participant_set` filter in
///     `tau_with_config` — an unenrolled creator's state transition cannot reach the executor;
///   * (4), the RATIFIER filter, closed by [`ratifies_enrolled`] (HORIZONLOG B6) — an unenrolled
///     creator can no longer make up a supermajority that anchors a wave, nor shape which blocks a
///     wave's coverage orders. These are independent: (5) held of the pre-B6 rule too, because the
///     unenrolled creator's OWN blocks were dropped from the ORDER while its VOTE still finalized
///     the honest ones.
///   * (1) and (2), the WAVE CLOCK, closed by [`compute_rounds`] taking the participant set. A
///     non-participant's ack no longer adds depth, so a relay chain cannot move which round a
///     block sits at, which round is a wave start or wave end, or where `xsort` puts an honest
///     block. That was NOT merely wave timing, which is how it was written up when B6 left it
///     open: two honest nodes holding the IDENTICAL enrolled sub-lace and differing only in
///     whether they received the relay finalized the same coordinates in different orders
///     (`BlocklaceFinality.traceOrderFork`) or one of them finalized nothing at all
///     (`traceRelayStall`) — a fork and a stall, not a delay.
///
/// ⚑ **(3) is what remains** — leader selection is already participant-only in `tau`, but the two
/// functions' LINEARIZERS still differ: [`xsort`] is a Kahn sweep with a min-block-id ready heap
/// and the Lean `xsortBy` is a `(round, id)` key sort. They coincide only where every block acks
/// all of the previous layer. That is OPEN-CM-XSORT, named in the Lean header, and it is a
/// different defect from this one.
///
/// The algorithm is the same as `tau_with_config` — CM Def. 6's head selection, backward anchor
/// chain and closure-difference fold, sharing [`ratified_leader_chain`] and
/// [`order_over_anchor_chain`] with it — but:
/// 1. `compute_rounds_filtered` only counts blocks from `reference_group.participants`
/// 2. Wave assignment uses filtered rounds
/// 3. Leader selection from reference group only
/// 4. Approval/ratification counts from reference group only (`tau` now does this too)
/// 5. Output only contains blocks from reference group participants (`tau` now does this too)
