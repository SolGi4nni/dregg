//! # THE SELECTOR-GATE FORGERY BITE — the light-client unfoolability close for the gate-less
//! value-cohort family (setField / mint / attenuate / revokeCapability / grantCap).
//!
//! ## The forgery this closes
//!
//! The deployed sovereign verifier (`turn::executor::verify_and_commit_proof_rotated`) resolves ONE
//! rotated descriptor by `vm_effects.first()` and verifies ONE proof over a one-row-per-effect trace.
//! Before the fix, the per-slot setField descriptor (`setFieldVmDescriptor2-{0..7}R24`) and the mint /
//! attenuate / revokeCapability / grantCap members carried NO selector-binding gate. So a turn whose
//! LEAD is gate-less + a TAIL effect — e.g. `[SetField(slot0, v), Transfer(self→victim, A)]` — proved
//! under the gate-less setField LEAD descriptor while the TAIL (Transfer) row's transition was
//! UNFORCED: the prover set the tail row's balance FREELY, the commitment-integrity gates still
//! passed, and `verify_vm_descriptor2` ACCEPTED. A ledgerless light client was fooled (a silent
//! cross-effect transfer the descriptor never constrained).
//!
//! ## The close (Lean-emitted, law #1)
//!
//! Each gate-less member now appends `selectorGate <ownRuntimeSelector>` (`EffectVmEmit.§6½`,
//! `EffectVmEmitRotationV3.withSelectorGate`): the per-row body `(1 - sel[NOOP])·(1 - sel[s])` is
//! forced ZERO on every transition row, so a NON-pad row must carry the descriptor's OWN runtime
//! selector. The foreign-selector TAIL row (`sel[NOOP] = 0`, `sel[SET_FIELD] = 0`, `sel[TRANSFER] =
//! 1`) makes the body `1·1 = 1 ≠ 0` → UNSAT. The forgery is dead at `verify_vm_descriptor2` /
//! `prove_vm_descriptor2` ALONE — no ledger needed.
//!
//! ## The teeth
//!
//!   * NEGATIVE (end-to-end shape): a `[SetField(slot0, v), Transfer]` trace under the setField-0
//!     LEAD descriptor, with the Transfer tail row's balance FORGED (a free debit with no honest
//!     source) — proving REFUSES. Mirrored for mint (`[BridgeMint, Transfer]`).
//!     ⚠ Both arms are OVER-DETERMINED at HEAD and are NOT attribution: measured 2026-07-28 by
//!     removing the gate and re-proving, the forged debit ALSO violates each member's own every-row
//!     balance freeze / balance algebra and the rotated balance weld, so a gate-less clone refuses
//!     them too. They establish that the forged turn does not prove; they do not establish which
//!     constraint says so.
//!   * ATTRIBUTION (the bite, both poles): `foreign_selector_tail_is_refused_by_the_gate_alone`
//!     picks a tail the other gates ADMIT — a ZERO-amount `Transfer`, which moves no balance — so
//!     the foreign `sel[TRANSFER]` on a non-pad row is the sole defect. That trace is UNSAT under
//!     the committed member and PROVES + VERIFIES under a clone with exactly that one gate removed.
//!     One constraint is the entire difference between accept and refuse.
//!   * POSITIVE (no downgrade): an HONEST single-cohort setField turn (the homogeneous shape the
//!     deployed sovereign verify path receives — heterogeneous turns split per cohort in
//!     PATH-PRESERVE / are rejected by the rotated prover) still proves+verifies GREEN.
//!     ⚠ "Honest" is byte-position-sensitive: see [`lane0_field_bytes`]. A value written into
//!     `bytes[0..4]` is NOT an honest turn under the deployed member — the fields GENTIAN freeze
//!     makes it UNSAT — and until 2026-07-28 this file carried exactly that, so the positive
//!     control was red and both negative arms were being satisfied by the freeze rather than by
//!     the gate.
//!
//! Gated on `prover` (compiles `descriptor_ir2`). Run with
//! `cargo test -p dregg-circuit --features prover selector_gate -- --nocapture`.

// (formerly `#![cfg(feature = "prover")]` — that dregg-circuit feature is GONE; the
// descriptor-level prove/verify (`prove_vm_descriptor2`/`verify_vm_descriptor2`) is
// now unconditional in dregg-circuit, so this test compiles + runs by default.)

/// THE ATTRIBUTION TOOTH — the selector gate, and NOTHING ELSE, refuses a foreign-selector tail row.
///
/// The two forgery arms above are TRUE but over-determined: their forged free debit also violates
/// the member's own every-row balance freeze / balance algebra and the rotated balance weld, so a
/// gate-less clone refuses them too (measured 2026-07-28) and their green says nothing about the
/// gate. This arm removes the over-determination by choosing a tail the OTHER gates admit — a
/// ZERO-amount `Transfer`, which moves no balance and so trips no balance constraint — leaving the
/// foreign `sel[TRANSFER]` on a non-pad row as the sole defect. Both poles are then forced:
///
///   * REFUSED under the committed `setFieldVmDescriptor2-0R24` (the gate bites);
///   * PROVES + VERIFIES under a clone with exactly that one gate removed (nothing else objects).
///
/// The second pole is the anti-vacuity guard AND the demonstration: the ONLY difference between the
/// accepting and the refusing run is `selectorGate SET_FIELD`, so the refusal is attributable to it.
/// It is also the concrete forgery the close was written for — a tail effect riding a single-
/// descriptor cohort proof completely unconstrained, which the LEAD-resolved sovereign verify path
/// would otherwise accept.
