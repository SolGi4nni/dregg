//! **The unforced-PI-pin census, measured on the DEPLOYED bytes through the DEPLOYED decoder.**
//!
//! A `PiBinding { row, col, pi_index }` is `local[col] == pv[pi_index]` on the tagged row
//! (`descriptor_ir2.rs`, the `Ir2Air` eval). That is a BINDING only when something else in the
//! member forces `local[col]`. When no other constraint reads the column, the prover chooses BOTH
//! sides — it picks the column value, publishes it, and the pin is satisfied by construction. The
//! published slot is then host trust wearing an AIR's clothes: a full node compensates by
//! OVERWRITING the slot from its own trusted turn before verifying, and **a light client has no
//! host to do the overwriting.**
//!
//! This file authors no constraint. It parses the three deployed registry TSVs with
//! `parse_vm_descriptor2` — the same decoder the prover feeds — and measures. The AIR-side repair
//! is Lean-authored: `metatheory/Dregg2/Circuit/Emit/UnforcedPiPins.lean` defines `forcedCols` /
//! `unforcedPins` / `dropUnforcedPins`, proves the subtraction a weakening
//! (`satisfied2_dropUnforcedPins`), proves it a FIXPOINT (`unforcedPins_dropUnforcedPins`), proves
//! the dropped column DEAD afterwards (`dropUnforcedPins_col_dead`, so the already-proven E1
//! kill-set removes it), and proves the dropped pin a no-op
//! (`unforced_pin_row_admits_any_value`: overwrite the column and every slot its pins publish with
//! an ARBITRARY value and every constraint still holds — a real binding refuses an inconsistent
//! publication; this one accepts every publication).
//!
//! ## The two reference notions, and why both are here
//!
//! * **row-blind** — `col` appears in NO non-pin constraint anywhere. The Lean subtraction's
//!   condition, and the strongest statement: nothing in the member relates the column to anything.
//! * **row-aware** — `col` appears only in constraints that are INACTIVE on the row the pin fires
//!   on. The live instance is the `.transition { hi, lo }` continuity chain, which is
//!   `is_transition`-gated: it forces row `i+1`'s `state_before[hi]` from row `i`'s
//!   `state_after[lo]` for `i < n-1`. So the FIRST row's `state_before` column has no predecessor
//!   to be forced from, and the LAST row's `state_after` column has no successor. That is exactly
//!   the multiplier vacuity the last-row anchor forge was: a column can look referenced and be
//!   free precisely where the pin reads it.
//!
//! ## Expected counts — the convergence re-emit LANDED (2026-07-31)
//!
//! This file used to carry the 2026-07-30 pre-re-emit measurement and say: *"When that re-emit
//! lands `dropUnforcedPins`, the row-blind counts go to ZERO and this test goes RED — which is the
//! point: whoever lands it must state the new number here."* It landed, this went red, and the new
//! numbers are stated below. They are not transcribed off the failure: each was re-derived by an
//! independent second implementation of `collect`/`free_row_*` run over the same committed TSVs,
//! and the two agree exactly.
//!
//!   v3     839 → 682 → 830 pins, blind 165 → **0**, aware 216 → **51**
//!   wide  1639 → 1480 → 1628 pins, blind 167 → **0**, aware 215 → **48**
//!   welded  (identical to wide)
//!
//! ⚑ The THIRD number in each row is the rc FOLD (2026-07-31, same day). It restored 148 pins —
//! the `withDfaRcPins` DFA route-commitment quartet on each of the 37 rc-wrapped members — WITHOUT
//! touching `dropUnforcedPins`: `EffectVmEmitRotationV3.caveatV3SitesAt` now absorbs the carrier
//! into the published caveat commitment, so those columns are READ and the pins survive the
//! subtraction on their own merits. That is the only honest way to bring a censused pin back.
//!
//! **`blind = 0` is the theorem, not a coincidence.** `unforcedPins_dropUnforcedPins` proves the
//! subtraction is a FIXPOINT: `forcedCols` counts only NON-pin constraints, the subtraction removes
//! only pins, so the forced surface is invariant and a second pass finds nothing. Measuring 0 here
//! is the deployed-bytes witness of that theorem, and any nonzero value means a member was emitted
//! without passing through `dropUnforcedPins`.
//!
//! **`aware` fell 216 → 51 purely as a consequence:** `aware` counts pins free ON THEIR OWN ROW,
//! which is a superset of `blind`. Before: 216 = 165 blind + 51 aware-only. After: 51 = 0 + 51. The
//! aware-only residue — the legacy 1-felt state-commitment pins — is UNCHANGED at (51, 48, 48),
//! because the row-blind subtraction cannot reach it. That is stated as its own assertion below.
//!
//! ⚑ AND `forcedCols` OVER-COUNTS BY EXACTLY TWO. A `proof_bind` has no row denotation — the
//! deployed `Ir2Air::eval` `continue`s on it and emits no bus interaction, and Lean's
//! `VmConstraint2.holdsAt` is `trivial` for it — yet `forcedCols` counts its `commit`/`vk` column
//! references. So `customVmDescriptor2R24`'s two surviving exposure pins (PI 46 → col 72, PI 54 →
//! col 68) are as prover-chosen as the 159 that were deleted; they survive on the strength of a
//! DECLARATION. That is measured, not asserted in prose, by
//! [`proof_bind_is_the_only_reader_of_the_custom_exposure_columns`].
