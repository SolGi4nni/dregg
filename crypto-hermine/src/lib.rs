//! # crypto-hermine — a spec-faithful REFERENCE implementation of the Hermine
//! lattice threshold signature (IACR ePrint 2026/419, the Raccoon-based
//! FROST-analog), pinned to the verified Lean spec.
//!
//! ## Provenance — the Lean spec this crate matches, symbol for symbol
//!
//! * `metatheory/Dregg2/Crypto/HermineThreshold.lean`
//!   - `verify A t w c z := A z = w + c • t`             → [`verify`]
//!   - `raccoon_sig_verifies` (`z = y + c·s` verifies)   → the single-signer
//!     case of the threshold tests
//!   - `hermine_cert_verifies_under_group_key`
//!     (`s = Σ λ_i•s_i`, `z_i = y_i + c•(λ_i•s_i)`,
//!     `z = Σ z_i`, `w = A(Σ y_i)`, `t = A·s`)           → [`threshold::hermine_sign`]
//!   - `hermine_share_is_valid_under_key_share`          → [`threshold::partial_response`]
//!     / [`threshold::HermineShare::key_share`]
//! * `metatheory/Dregg2/Crypto/HermineExtractor.lean`
//!   - `hermine_special_soundness_extracts_relation`
//!     (`A(z − z') = (c − c')•t` from two accepting
//!     transcripts sharing a commitment)                 → [`threshold::extracted_relation`]
//!   - `extractPreimage c c' z z' = (c−c')⁻¹•(z−z')`     → [`threshold::extract_preimage`]
//! * `metatheory/Dregg2/Crypto/Smudging.lean` — noise-flooding, the KEY-HIDING leg
//!   - `unif S` over a wide interval `[-M/2, M/2)`       → [`threshold::sample_wide_mask`]
//!   - `smudge_bound` (statistical distance `≤ B/M`
//!     between the flooded response distributions
//!     under two secrets, `B ≥ ‖c·Δs‖∞`)                 → the empirical TV
//!     key-hiding test in [`threshold`] (wide mask hides; narrow mask leaks)
//!   - beyond the Lean spec: the production-shaped
//!     discrete-GAUSSIAN flooding variant
//!     (CDT sampler, tail-cut `⌈τσ⌉`)                    → [`threshold::DiscreteGaussian`]
//!     / [`threshold::hermine_sign_gaussian`]; its hiding (TV shrinking in
//!     `σ`) is witnessed EMPIRICALLY, not Lean-pinned — the Lean `Smudging`
//!     proof covers the uniform+TV leg only
//!   - the `ShortNorm` carrier (shortness of `z`,
//!     `z − z'`)                                         → [`threshold::signature_norm`]
//!     / [`threshold::acceptance_bound`]
//!
//! The Lean spec is stated over an abstract `R`-linear map `A : M →ₗ[R] N`.
//! This reference instantiates `R = R_q = ℤ_q[X]/(Xⁿ+1)` ([`ring`]),
//! `M = R_q^ℓ`, `N = R_q^k`, and `A` a `k×ℓ` matrix over `R_q` ([`linalg`]) —
//! the module structure the deployed scheme actually uses. The instantiation's
//! linearity (the Lean hypothesis) is itself tested, not assumed.
//!
//! ## Production boundary — what this crate is NOT
//!
//! This is the exact executable the verified Lean spec pins, for tests and
//! differentials. It is NOT deployment-grade and must never be wired into
//! live signing:
//!
//! * **keygen** — the real-key path is now the dealerless Pedersen-style DKG
//!   ([`dkg::HermineDkg`]): every member deals its OWN short secret with
//!   Feldman-style commitments (`A·coeff` broadcasts), received shares are
//!   VERIFIED against the broadcasts (a cheating dealer is detected and
//!   named), final shares sum to a t-of-n sharing of `s = Σᵢ sᵢ` that no
//!   party ever holds. The trusted [`threshold::HermineTestDealer`] remains
//!   ONLY for known-secret algebra tests. The DKG itself is still a
//!   REFERENCE: synchronous/in-process (no broadcast channel or network),
//!   detection without complaint-round arbitration, no rushing-adversary
//!   bias fix (Gennaro et al.), reference PRNG — see [`dkg`]'s boundary doc;
//! * **no binding factors** — single-ceremony only; concurrent-session
//!   (Drijvers/ROS-style) attacks are out of model;
//! * **reference PRNG, non-constant-time samplers** — noise-flooding now
//!   comes in BOTH variants: the uniform+TV one the Lean `Smudging` spec
//!   proves (masks uniform over `[-M/2, M/2)`) AND the production-shaped
//!   discrete-GAUSSIAN one (CDT sampler over a `⌈τσ⌉` tail,
//!   [`threshold::hermine_sign_gaussian`]) with the TV-vs-σ hiding trade
//!   witnessed empirically. But both run over splitmix64 — NOT a CSPRNG —
//!   and the Gaussian CDT lookup is a value-dependent binary search — NOT
//!   constant-time. A CSPRNG + constant-time (data-independent) sampling +
//!   external audit are the remaining production steps on this leg;
//! * **toy challenge hash** — non-cryptographic; it does squeeze a SHORT
//!   ternary challenge (`‖c‖∞ ≤ 1`, which the smudging shift bound needs),
//!   but not the deployed fixed-weight unit-difference challenge set;
//! * **combined-signature flooding only** — per-signer partials ride
//!   full-range Lagrange coefficients; the real threshold scheme's
//!   per-party masking/shortness story is out of scope;
//! * **realistic-ward, not production, parameters** — `n = 256` (the production dimension) with the
//!   Dilithium prime `q = 8380417` (NTT-friendly, real-modulus arithmetic;
//!   the hiding/shortness gap is now real headroom, not a demonstration
//!   sliver), but production Hermine needs `n ≥ 256` and vetted `k×ℓ`/σ
//!   from the parameter-search literature;
//! * **not constant-time**, and no zeroization of secrets.
//!
//! The production signer needs the DKG's deployment machinery (real
//! broadcast/private channels, complaint-round arbitration, the bias fix),
//! binding factors, a CSPRNG, constant-time arithmetic and sampling,
//! full-size parameters, and external audit. This crate's value is different: every identity the
//! Lean proofs establish is witnessed here on concrete `R_q` numbers —
//! including the Smudging key-hiding bound as an empirical total-variation
//! measurement, in both its uniform (Lean-pinned) and discrete-Gaussian
//! (production-shaped) forms — so the spec and the reference cannot
//! silently drift apart.
