//! **Actually VERIFY the fetched full-turn STARK — against something the committee signed.**
//!
//! `/proof turn` (and `/explorer proof`) fetch a committed turn's proof artifact off the node
//! (`/api/turn/{hash}/proof`) and re-run the SAME audited verifier a remote peer would
//! ([`dregg_sdk::verify_full_turn`]). This module is that check. It is NOT a "this turn happened"
//! verdict, and the surface must never render as one: read the seams below before touching
//! [`verdict_text`].
//!
//! # ⚑ THE ANCHOR IS A REQUIRED ARGUMENT
//!
//! Until 2026-08-06 this module passed the turn hash **from the request URL** and read the
//! before/after 8-felt commits **out of the artifact**, handing those straight back to the
//! verifier as the values it should expect. The two endpoint `CommitmentMismatch` teeth therefore
//! compared `x != x` and structurally could not fire.
//!
//! [`check_proof_hex`] now takes a [`CheckedAnchor`] — a
//! [`dregg_sdk::TurnAnchorV1`] fetched from `/api/turn/{hash}/anchor` and **verified in
//! this process against a committee roster** — and uses ITS turn hash. There is no unanchored
//! entry point: a caller that cannot obtain and verify an anchor cannot obtain a verdict from
//! here at all, which is the point. The same forcing shape `verify_full_turn_bound` uses for
//! `expected_turn_hash`.
//!
//! ## What that buys, precisely
//!
//! The anchor's turn hash comes out of a `TurnReceipt` whose `receipt_hash()` this process
//! recomputed, which roots the `receipt_stream_root` inside `AttestedRoot::signing_message()`,
//! over which `>= threshold` committee members signed. So the identity the artifact is judged
//! against is **the committee's**, not the URL's and not the artifact's. A proof served under
//! turn B, checked against turn A's anchor, is REFUSED — and a malicious *node* (as distinct from
//! a malicious committee) cannot forge the anchor to make it pass.
//!
//! ## What is (and is not) established
//!
//! * **Established:** the bytes ARE a sound composed STARK — every attached leg verifies under the
//!   audited Plonky3 verifier, the legs chain leg-to-leg (`chain_adjacency`, which DOES fire), the
//!   object binds one composed VK hash, and every effect-vm leg publishes the COMMITTEE-SIGNED
//!   turn hash at `pi::TURN_HASH_BASE`.
//! * **NOT established, seam 1 (the endpoint state anchors are still the proof's own).** The
//!   anchor DOES carry a committee-signed 8-felt state commit pair — the receipt's
//!   `pre_state_hash` / `post_state_hash`. **It is a different commitment from the one the proof
//!   publishes**, measured with both causes isolated in
//!   `turn/tests/receipt_state_commit_is_not_the_proof_state_commit.rs`: the receipt anchor uses
//!   `state_commit::consensus_ctx` (whole-ledger `cells_root`, `iroot = empty_iroot()`), the proof
//!   uses a single-cell context ledger with the real receipt-chain `iroot`. Feeding the receipt's
//!   pair to `verify_full_turn_bound` would refuse every honest proof, so this module keeps
//!   passing the artifact's own — and the two endpoint teeth still compare `x != x`. ⚑ This is
//!   **undone work, not a theorem**: closing it means aligning the executor's and the prover's
//!   `V9RotationContext` so one 8-felt commit per turn exists. Priced in
//!   `docs/DESIGN-pi-authority.md`.
//! * **NOT established, seam 2 (the identity is prover-CHOSEN, not prover-FORCED).** No AIR
//!   constraint reads those four felts — 0 of the 57 `WIDE_REGISTRY_STAGED_TSV` members bind a
//!   `pi_index` in `33..37` — so what the check forbids is RELABELLING an artifact. A malicious
//!   prover can still mint a fresh proof of some other transition and publish this turn's hash
//!   beside it. `docs/DESIGN-pi-authority.md` §3 argues this one is a **theorem of the model**
//!   (`Turn::hash` absorbs the proof bytes, so a sovereign proof can never publish it), not
//!   transmutable debt.
//! * **NOT established, seam 3 (how big the committee really is).** On the live path
//!   `AttestedRoot::quorum_signatures` receives exactly ONE push — the local node's — so on a
//!   federation with `threshold > 1` no anchor verifies at all and this command refuses. That
//!   refusal is the honest outcome, not a bug to route around. Closing it means putting
//!   `receipt_stream_root` into the finalization-vote preimage so the `>= threshold` hybrid vote
//!   quorum reaches the receipt. Also undone work.
//!
//! All three seams are reported at runtime, not only here: [`check_proof_hex`] fills
//! [`ProofCheck::unbound`] and [`verdict_text`] prints it under the verdict.
