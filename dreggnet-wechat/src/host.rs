//! # `WeChatHost` — the MULTI-OFFERING WeChat layer over the ONE offering core.
//!
//! [`crate::WeChatFrontend`] is offering #0's WeChat surface: it plays a single
//! [`DungeonOffering`](dreggnet_offerings::dungeon::DungeonOffering) as an OA numbered-reply
//! message. This module gives the dungeon (and every other offering) the FULL DreggNet catalog on
//! WeChat — the same "all offerings, any surface" the web catalog ([`dreggnet_web::CatalogState`])
//! and the Telegram host ([`dreggnet_telegram::host::TelegramHost`]) got — by driving the
//! frontend-agnostic [`OfferingHost`] through the WeChat OA numbered-reply surface:
//!
//! - **list** — [`WeChatHost::list_offerings`] / [`WeChatHost::present_offerings_menu`]: an
//!   `/offerings`-style control message whose numbered reply list is one line per registered
//!   offering (a reply of its number opens that offering in the user's 1:1 conversation);
//! - **open** — [`WeChatHost::open`] (solo) / [`WeChatHost::join`] (a shared room): open a session
//!   on the host and present the offering's [`Surface`] as the WeChat OA numbered reply list;
//! - **advance** — [`WeChatHost::reply`]: an inbound numbered reply → [`WeChatFrontend::collect`]
//!   the typed [`Action`] → [`OfferingHost::advance`] ONE real turn on the substrate → re-present;
//! - **verify** — [`WeChatHost::verify`]: re-verify an offering session's committed chain; ALSO
//!   routed through [`WeChatHost::reply`] as the reserved [`TURN_VERIFY`] marked reply
//!   (`#verifychain:0`), so a shell's "verify" input reaches the real re-verifier through the ONE
//!   router.
//!
//! ## The Surface → numbered-reply mapping (mirrors the Telegram keyboard mapping)
//! An offering's [`Surface`] is a deos view-tree; its cap-gated [`Action`]s are the moves. WeChat OA
//! forbids arbitrary per-message buttons, so — unlike Telegram's inline keyboard — the affordances
//! ride as a **numbered list appended to the message text**, and the user **replies with the
//! number** ([`crate::api::present_message`] → the shared [`deos_view::WeChatBackend`]). A reply is
//! resolved back to its `{turn, arg}` by the SAME shared codec ([`deos_view::WeChatMessage::resolve`],
//! via [`WeChatFrontend::collect`]) — a reply number naming one of the presented options, or a
//! `#<turn>:<arg>` marked id. The offerings menu is a host-level control surface whose numbered
//! options carry [`TURN_OPEN`] `{turn:"open", arg: offering index}`.
//!
//! **Value-taking moves** (a market `list` reserve, a `bid` value) carry a value the reply supplies.
//! On a live OA a numbered pick of such a move prompts "reply with the amount" and a bare-number
//! follow-up becomes the value; the general shape (also what a Mini-Program button posts back) is the
//! `#<turn>:<value>` marked reply the shared codec already resolves — exactly analogous to the
//! Telegram host taking the value from the button's `callback_data`. Both leave the executor the sole
//! referee of what LANDS (a below-reserve bid, a double-vote are real substrate refusals).
//!
//! ## The `!Send` host + the [`HostThread`] handle (mirrors `dreggnet-web` / the Telegram host)
//! The [`OfferingHost`] owns heterogeneous offering sessions, some `!Send` (a
//! `CouncilOffering` session holds `Rc`-backed ballot caps). So
//! the host cannot be shared behind a plain `Send` handle; it lives on ONE owning thread and every
//! access is a job shipped to it — only the job's plain-data result (a [`Surface`], an [`Outcome`], a
//! [`VerifyReport`], a `Vec<OfferingInfo>`, all `Send`) crosses back. The [`WeChatFrontend`] itself
//! (the affordance-renderer + the injected transport) stays on the calling thread; it never holds an
//! offering session. This is exactly `dreggnet-web`'s [`HostThread`](dreggnet_web) pattern.
//!
//! ## Session shape: per-participant surfaces onto a shared room session
//! A WeChat OA conversation is strictly **1:1** — there is no group-chat affordance surface (unlike a
//! Telegram group / forum topic, which the Telegram host keys a session by). So the WeChat host keys
//! each participant's *surface* by their OpenID ([`WeChatFrontend::session_id`] → `wx:<openid>`) while
//! the underlying host *session* is a **room** [`SessionId`]:
//! - **solo** — [`WeChatHost::open`]: room = the openid's own `wx:<openid>` session — the canonical
//!   single-player per-`(offering, openid)` case (a dungeon).
//! - **shared** — [`WeChatHost::join`]: several openids act on ONE room session, each in their own 1:1
//!   conversation (their own numbered-reply surface onto the shared state), each move attributed to
//!   the sender's derived identity. This is what makes a COLLECTIVE offering (a quorum council, a
//!   multi-bidder market) genuinely playable over 1:1 OA conversations.
//!
//! ## Honest scope — what a live WeChat deploy adds
//! Everything here is driven at the logic level with [`crate::transport::MockTransport`] (NO token,
//! NO network). A live deploy adds only: a valid OA access-token + a reqwest-backed
//! [`HttpPost`](crate::transport::HttpPost) under [`RawWeChatApi`](crate::transport::RawWeChatApi);
//! the OA webhook / update loop that turns real inbound `Message` posts into [`WeChatHost::reply`]
//! calls (and, for a shared room, the openid→room routing an orchestrator maintains one layer up); a
//! prompt-then-collect step for value moves (or the `#<turn>:<value>` marked reply used here); and a
//! durable session store (this host keeps sessions in memory on its owning thread, seeded
//! deterministically from the room id, so a restart re-derives the SAME replay-verifiable session but
//! loses in-flight state).
