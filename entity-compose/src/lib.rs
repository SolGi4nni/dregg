//! # entity-compose — the HOARDLIGHT substrate, wired end to end, game-free
//!
//! This crate stands up a real **ENTITY** and lands a real **composition turn**, composing
//! four already-built, already-committed pieces that had never been wired together before:
//!
//! 1. **A param-carrying entity** — a [`dregg_cell::Cell`] whose *wide extended plane*
//!    (`set_field_ext` at key `>= 16` → the committed `fields_map`) carries a bounded typed
//!    param vector. The params are genuinely IN the cell's state: they move its v9 chip
//!    commitment (the value the Door welds).
//! 2. **`dregg-param-compose`** — the GENERAL Custom-VK AIR proving
//!    `outcome = Σ_linear coeff·P[role].params[i] + Σ_knots coeff·P[a].params[i]·P[b].params[j]`
//!    over N typed subjects composed by a versioned, publicly-committed ruleset.
//! 3. **The Door** (`dregg_turn::action::Effect::Custom`) — a custom proof reaches
//!    `TurnExecutor::execute`, which verifies the VK, the registry dispatch, and the STATE
//!    WELD (`pis[0..8] == the cell's stored commitment`, `pis[8..16] == the claimed new`).
//! 4. **The cell** — the outcome is committed to the entity's cell, welded to its real
//!    pre/post state.
//!
//! ## The generic vocabulary is the point
//!
//! Everything here speaks in `subjects`, `params`, `roles`, `knots`, `ruleset`, `outcome` —
//! never a creature, a stat, or a rule. HOARDLIGHT's living world is ONE ruleset root + its
//! content (params) over this substrate, exactly as a new `dregg-param-compose` game is a new
//! ruleset root and not an AIR edit. Nothing in this crate is dragon-specific.
//!
//! ## What composes end to end (HONEST SCOPE)
//!
//! **What composes, driven through the real executor** (`tests/end_to_end.rs`):
//! a real entity's params determine its v9 commitment; a composition READ from those params
//! proves under the ruleset; the turn carrying it passes the Door and the state weld against
//! the entity's REAL commitment; a proof about a DIFFERENT entity (different params → different
//! commitment) is refused by the weld; a composition the ruleset does not license has no
//! satisfying witness. The realistic composition rides `dregg-param-compose`'s 803-column leaf
//! (`tests/budget.rs`), and the composition leaf really proves + binds its commitment
//! (`tests/leaf_prove.rs`, `#[ignore]`, minutes).
//!
//! ## The outcome→cell-field weld — CLOSED by ADOPTING the deployed app-root atom
//!
//! The state weld binds the *whole cell* transition (`old8`/`new8`), but by itself it does not
//! force the post cell's stored outcome field to equal the sub-proof's published
//! `outcome_commitment` public input — a host could write outcome `X` into the cell while the
//! sub-proof commits outcome `Y`, and the state weld alone would not notice ("the host wrote
//! both"). That residual is closed by the SAME in-circuit tie the multiway-tug win-proof
//! deployed on Friday: the **app-root weld**
//! (`dregg_circuit::effect_vm::custom_state_binding::AppRootBinding` + the deployed fold node
//! `dregg_circuit_prove::joint_turn_recursive::prove_custom_binding_node_app_root_segmented`).
//!
//! **Say the substrate out loud:** this is NOT hand-written Rust AIR and NOT new Lean AIR. The
//! tie is a *fold `connect`* inside the recursion tree a pure light client folds (its in-circuit
//! keystone descends from Lean `CustomBindingFromFold`). Rust here does only two ABI things, no
//! constraint authoring: (1) it RELOCATES the 8-felt `outcome_commitment` out of the wide plane
//! and into the entity cell's **native `fields[0..8]` octet** — the octet the wide Custom leg
//! exposes and the `new8` commitment absorbs at lane-0 (`field_limbs8(fields[i])[0]`), the SAME
//! lane the deployed weld reads; and (2) it DECLARES the binding
//! ([`LandedComposition::app_root_binding`]) so the outcome PI at
//! [`pi::outcome_commitment_base`] is tied, lane-by-lane, to that committed octet. The wide
//! plane cannot be reached by the atom (`field_key` indexes only the native octet), which is
//! why the outcome moved into `fields[0..8]`.
//!
//! With the binding declared and the fold routed through the app-root node, a composed entity
//! whose PUBLISHED outcome does not equal its COMMITTED octet has NO satisfying fold (UNSAT, no
//! root, the light client never receives a verifying artifact) — driven, honest-accepts /
//! forged-refuses, in `dregg-braid-hook`'s weld canary. [`LandedComposition::app_root_binding`]
//! is the declaration a game/offering hands to the deployed chain prover;
//! [`LandedComposition::harness_verify_outcome_welded`] reads back the committed octet as a fast
//! shadow of the equality the fold now enforces for real.
