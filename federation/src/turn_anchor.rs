//! **THE PER-TURN ANCHOR** — the committee-signed statement a stranger obtains so that
//! re-verifying a served full-turn STARK is a check against something, instead of a check
//! against the artifact's own claims.
//!
//! # The hole this closes
//!
//! `dregg_sdk::verify_full_turn_bound` takes `expected_turn_hash` / `expected_old_commit` /
//! `expected_new_commit` FROM THE CALLER. Until this type existed, the only production surface
//! serving proofs to a third party (`GET /api/turn/{hash}/proof`) served
//! `{turn_hash, proof_status, proof_len, proof_hex}` and nothing else, so the discord bot's
//! `/proof turn` read the before/after anchors OUT of the artifact and handed them straight back
//! — the two endpoint `CommitmentMismatch` teeth compared `x != x` and structurally could not
//! fire. The turn hash came from the REQUEST URL, which is better (it is not read out of the
//! artifact) but is still whatever the caller typed at a node that may be lying.
//!
//! A [`TurnAnchorV1`] is a **projection of state the federation already signed**. It invents no
//! new authority: every byte in it is either recomputable by the holder or covered by a
//! signature the committee already produced on the finalized path. It is deliberately NOT a
//! node-signed envelope around values the node computed — that would reproduce the same defect
//! one layer out.
//!
//! # The chain of custody, and exactly how far it reaches
//!
//! ```text
//!   committee member's ed25519 signature
//!     over AttestedRoot::signing_message()          <- `quorum_signatures`
//!        which absorbs `receipt_stream_root`
//!     = merkle_root_of_receipt_hashes([receipt_hash])   (ONE leaf per finalized block:
//!                                                        node/src/blocklace_sync.rs:9685-9695)
//!        which absorbs `receipt_hash`
//!     = TurnReceipt::receipt_hash()  (domain `dregg-receipt-v5`)
//!        which absorbs `turn_hash`, `pre_state_hash`, `post_state_hash`, `effects_hash`, `agent`
//! ```
//!
//! So a valid anchor says: *at least `threshold` distinct members of the committee you named
//! signed a statement that this exact receipt — hence this exact turn hash — is the receipt
//! stream of the finalized block `block_id` at height `height`, whose post-state canonical
//! ledger root is `merkle_root`.*
//!
//! ## ⚑ WHAT THE 8-FELT STATE ANCHORS IN HERE ARE — AND ARE NOT
//!
//! `TurnReceipt::{pre,post}_state_hash` are the AIR-bound chip 8-felt consensus commitment
//! (`dregg_turn::state_commit`, packed by `Faithful8::to_bytes32`), so this anchor DOES carry a
//! committee-signed 8-felt per-turn state commit pair. **It is NOT the pair the full-turn proof
//! publishes**, and it must never be handed to `verify_full_turn_bound` as
//! `expected_old_commit` / `expected_new_commit` — doing so refuses every honest proof.
//!
//! ⚠ **THERE ARE FOUR CAUSES, NOT TWO — corrected 2026-08-07.** This docblock named two, as did
//! every other description of the divergence in the tree. Each is independently sufficient, and
//! all four are measured cause-by-cause in
//! `turn/tests/receipt_state_commit_is_not_the_proof_state_commit.rs`:
//!
//! * **`iroot`.** The receipt anchor pins `state_commit::consensus_ctx`'s
//!   `iroot = rotation_witness::empty_iroot()` deliberately (a receipt cannot bind the
//!   commitment its own hash is computed from). ⚠ The proof side does NOT "fold the real receipt
//!   chain" — that is true of exactly one of four producers, the ledgerless sovereign
//!   `cipherclerk`, whose artifacts this endpoint never serves. The live node path folds a
//!   ONE-ENTRY log: `[receipt.receipt_hash()]` on the non-spend and bearer arms
//!   (`blocklace_sync.rs:9239`, `:9319`), `[turn_hash]` on the cap-less spend arm
//!   (`turn_proving.rs:1298`). Three conventions, three different published commits for one
//!   transition.
//! * **`cells_root`.** The receipt anchor folds the WHOLE ledger
//!   (`state_commit::consensus_ctx` -> `rotation_witness::cells_root(ledger)`); the proof's
//!   witness folds a SINGLE-CELL context ledger holding only the actor
//!   (`node/src/turn_proving.rs::rotation_witness_for_self_sovereign_impl`, `ctx_ledger`).
//! * **`revoked_root`** (unnamed before 2026-08-07). The anchor threads the executor's LIVE
//!   `note_revoked.root8()`; `rotation_witness_for_self_sovereign_impl` writes
//!   `empty_revoked_root_8()` unconditionally and has no parameter for it. Dormant until the
//!   federation's first revocation, permanent after.
//! * **`material`** (unnamed before 2026-08-07). `consensus_ctx` hardcodes
//!   `RotationCarrierMaterial::default()`; the proof carries the installed `child_vk` on a
//!   factory turn's AFTER block. ⚑ This is the one cause that should not be closed by moving the
//!   proving side: `factoryV3Carriers` `.piBinding`s that octet as PI 47..54 precisely to EXPOSE
//!   the installed child VK, so zeroing it on the prover would blank a published surface.
//!   (ⓘ Whether any verifier ANCHORS those PIs is NOT established — `executor/proof_verify.rs`
//!   constructs no `RotationCarrierMaterial`. Do not relay a UNSAT claim about it.)
//!
//! They are two different commitments of the same transition. Aligning them is real work; it is
//! priced in `docs/DESIGN-pi-authority.md` and NOT done here. ⚑ But the price is not what that
//! doc assumed: `trace_rotated::fill_block` copies `cells_root` and `iroot` straight out of the
//! producer witness and (per `EffectVmEmitRotationV3.cellsRootGroupCol`'s own docstring) only
//! createCell/factory/spawn constrain the cells group — so three of the four causes converge by
//! moving the PROVING side, at **no VK rotation, no descriptor re-emit and no re-genesis**,
//! because the signed anchor does not move at all. Only `material` moves it.
//!
//! What this anchor therefore delivers to a proof re-verifier TODAY is the **turn identity**,
//! which every effect-vm leg publishes at `pi::TURN_HASH_BASE` and which
//! `verify_full_turn_bound` compares as a required argument.
//!
//! ## ⚑ THE OTHER TWO ARGUMENTS ARE NOW SERVED TOO — but NOT by this type, and deliberately
//!
//! Since 2026-08-07 `GET /api/turn/{h}/anchor` returns, **beside** `anchor_hex` and outside it, a
//! `proof_state_commits` pair: the 8-felt `(old_commit, new_commit)` the serving node's commit
//! path derived for that turn (`node::turn_proving::turn_proof_anchors_config_key` —
//! `RotationTurnWitness::wide_commit_anchors`, generate-only over the executor's trusted pre-state
//! and the turn's effects, independent of the proof bytes, and gated on by
//! `verify_full_turn_bound` before the artifact was published). That is what a checker now passes
//! as `expected_old_commit` / `expected_new_commit`, so the two `CommitmentMismatch` teeth stop
//! comparing `x != x`.
//!
//! ⚠ **It is NOT part of [`TurnAnchorV1`], and must not be moved into it.** This type's whole
//! contract is that every byte in it is either recomputable by the holder or covered by a
//! signature the committee already produced. The derived pair is neither: it is the NODE's claim.
//! Putting it inside the postcard object would launder a node assertion into the anchor's
//! authority — the same defect one layer out, which is exactly what the type's own docs above
//! refuse. It rides in the JSON with `proof_commit_provenance` naming what it is, and
//! `proof_commit_status: "absent"` (⇒ the checker REFUSES) whenever the node did not mint the
//! artifact — a proof-carrying sovereign turn, or one minted by the ledgerless `sdk::cipherclerk`,
//! which cannot compute this chain's whole-ledger rotation context and therefore has no honest
//! pair to serve.
//!
//! Making the pair committee-signed is the four-cause alignment above. ⚑ And a lane that does it
//! should know, before pricing it, that alignment reaches the **BEFORE** anchor only: the
//! published BEFORE commit is `wire_commit_8_chip` over the before-cell's own limbs (the standing
//! differential `circuit/tests/effect_vm_wide_roundtrip.rs::assert_executor_anchor`), so under a
//! shared context it becomes `receipt.pre_state_hash` exactly. The AFTER commit cannot: the wide
//! generator's `fill_block` OVERRIDES the after block's welded `r0..r10`/`cap_root` from the v1
//! trace's post-effect state (`circuit/src/effect_vm/trace_rotated.rs:2730-2736`), and that state
//! is `VM(pre, effects)` — while `receipt.post_state_hash` commits the EXECUTOR's post-cell, which
//! also carries the phase-1 fee debit and the phase-1 nonce bump
//! (`turn/src/executor/execute.rs:652-674`) that no AIR on the classical commit path models. The
//! VM ticks the nonce once per non-padding ROW (`circuit/src/effect_vm/trace.rs:683-1035`) where
//! the executor bumps once per TURN. So the two post-states coincide only for a fee-free turn with
//! exactly one actor effect that is not `IncrementNonce`. **That is a fifth and sixth cause, of a
//! different kind from the four: they are modelling gaps in the proven transition, not context
//! conventions, and no re-parameterisation of `V9RotationContext` closes them.**
//!
//! ## ⚑ WHAT THE >=THRESHOLD COMMITTEE QUORUM COVERS — AND WHAT CHANGED IN v4
//!
//! Two quorum legs ride an `AttestedRoot`, over two different preimages. **Since the
//! finalization-vote domain moved v3 → v4, BOTH reach the receipt:**
//!
//! | leg | preimage | reaches the turn? | who signs it |
//! |---|---|---|---|
//! | `quorum_signatures` (ed25519) | [`AttestedRoot::signing_message`] — absorbs `receipt_stream_root` | **yes** | the LOCAL node only (one push) |
//! | `hybrid_quorum` (ed25519 ∧ ML-DSA-65) | [`AttestedRoot::hybrid_quorum_message`] = `domain-v4 ‖ block_id ‖ merkle_root ‖ framed(receipt_stream_root)` | **yes (v4)** | the assembled CROSS-NODE committee quorum |
//!
//! [`TurnAnchorV1::verify`] counts the UNION of distinct committee members across the two legs,
//! each verified against its own preimage. That is sound because both preimages bind the SAME
//! `(block_id, merkle_root, receipt_stream_root)` of the SAME root: a signer counted from either
//! leg really did sign a statement naming this receipt stream at this chain position.
//!
//! ⚑ **THE HISTORY THIS FIXES, because the refusal it produced was correct and load-bearing.**
//! Through v3 the vote preimage was `(block_id, merkle_root)` only — no per-turn value — and
//! `quorum_signatures` receives exactly one push, the local node's, because
//! `PeerMessage::AttestedRootUpdate` has zero handlers. So on any federation with `threshold > 1`
//! this anchor REFUSED, honestly, rather than reporting a caveat: no committee signature in the
//! tree covered a per-turn value. v4 does not relax that gate. It supplies the missing quorum:
//! the votes the committee already exchanges now bind `receipt_stream_root`, so
//! `>= threshold` distinct members genuinely sign a statement that reaches this turn. A
//! federation that has NOT yet assembled its vote quorum still refuses, and a sub-threshold one
//! still refuses — see `federation/tests/turn_anchor_refusals.rs`.
//!
//! The Lean side moved with it: `Dregg2.Distributed.FinalizationQuorum.quorum_binds_snd` and
//! `FinalityGate.quorum_gate_binds_receipt_stream` are the named theorems that a quorum on the
//! widened pair IS a supermajority of distinct signers agreeing on the receipt-stream component.
//!
//! # The roster is the caller's, never the anchor's
//!
//! [`TurnAnchorV1::verify`] takes the committee it should judge against as an ARGUMENT. The
//! anchor carries a roster only as a convenience for a caller with no configured one, and using
//! it means trusting the server that served the anchor — [`TurnAnchorV1::served_committee`] is
//! named so that call sites cannot pretend otherwise.
