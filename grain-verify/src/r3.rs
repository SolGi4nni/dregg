//! # R3 — the whole-history STARK leg, wired to the Lean-proven verifier.
//!
//! R0–R2 (in [`crate`]) make a hosted session tamper-evident, renter-anchored, and
//! kernel-linked — but still TRUST the executor host that produced and committed the
//! turns. R3 removes that trust for a grain's WHOLE history: fold the session's
//! finalized turns into ONE constant-size recursive-STARK aggregate
//! ([`prove_turn_chain_recursive_without_host_gate`]), light-verify it against the
//! renter's OWN trust anchor ([`verify_whole_chain_proof_bytes`]), and let the
//! LEAN-PROVEN R3 verify core render the accept decision — a lying host cannot serve a
//! fabricated or truncated history under an honest-looking anchored head.
//!
//! ## The decision is the Lean-proven object, not this Rust
//!
//! The accept/reject is NOT decided here. Rust does the heavy lifting — the fold and
//! the succinct-aggregate verify — and marshals four facts onto a wire:
//!   1. the whole-chain STARK verifier's **verified-status** (did the aggregate verify
//!      **against the caller's anchor**), from [`verify_whole_chain_proof_bytes`];
//!   2. the **fingerprint recomputed from the presented root**
//!      ([`WholeChainProof::root_vk_fingerprint`]) — a producer CLAIM, never an anchor;
//!   3. the **caller's expected VK anchor**, held out of band; and
//!   4. the **aggregate's committed 8-felt head** (`final_root`, all
//!      [`SEG_ANCHOR_WIDTH`] lanes) vs the **R1-anchored 8-felt head** the caller supplies.
//!
//! Those go to `Dregg2.Grain.R3Verify.r3VerifyFFI` (the `@[export] dregg_grain_r3_verify`
//! entry, reached via [`dregg_lean_ffi::shadow_grain_r3_verify`]) — the extracted,
//! `#assert_axioms`-clean `r3VerifyCore`. Its `"1"` IS the R3-accept, and its soundness is
//! the PROVED `r3_unfoolable` (the whole history is execution-integrity-sound AND
//! complete, with the anchored head pinned to its genuine fold).
//!
//! ## The felt-width + self-anchoring repair (wound #22)
//!
//! `docs/WOUND-felt-width-boundaries-2026-07-19.md` #22 catalogued this seam as a HIGH
//! design wound with TWO independently fatal conjuncts, and this module is its close.
//! The pre-fix seam marshalled `proof.final_root[0].as_u32()` — **lane 0 of an 8-felt
//! anchor**, ~31 bits — and called the light verifier with `proof.root_vk_fingerprint()`,
//! **the fingerprint the artifact itself supplied**:
//!
//!   * **the WIDTH.** A lying host *is* the party that supplies `finalized`. It could grind
//!     its own turn sequence offline (~2^31 cheap state-commit computations, no proving
//!     until the hit) for a fabricated final anchor whose LANE 0 matched the renter's
//!     honest `anchored_head`, then fold ONCE — and R3 accepted the fabrication as the
//!     renter's history. Now all [`SEG_ANCHOR_WIDTH`] = 8 lanes bind (~124-bit). The wide
//!     value already existed on BOTH sides: the aggregate carries `final_root: [BabyBear;
//!     8]`, and the anchor is sourced from the leg's `wide_new_root8() -> [BabyBear; 8]`.
//!     Nothing was invented; the seam simply stopped projecting.
//!   * **the SELF-ANCHORING.** Verifying against the proof's own fingerprint establishes
//!     nothing about which VK the proof *should* carry — so the verified-status said "this
//!     supplied blob self-verifies", not "this is the renter's chain", which is exactly why
//!     the ~31-bit head equality was carrying the whole binding. This was not a grey area:
//!     [`WholeChainProof::root_vk_fingerprint`]'s own docstring says "A VERIFIER must NEVER
//!     take the anchor from the artifact it is verifying", and
//!     [`verify_whole_chain_proof_bytes`]'s says "`expected_vk` is the caller's OWN
//!     configured anchor — it is NEVER read from the envelope". The pre-fix seam violated a
//!     documented API contract. [`r3_verify`] now TAKES the anchor.
//!
//!     And the effect was sharper than "weakly bound": **tooth 1 was a TAUTOLOGY.** The
//!     verifier's VK pin is `if recursion_vk_fingerprint(root_proof) != *expected_vk
//!     { refuse }`, and [`WholeChainProof::root_vk_fingerprint`] is *defined* as
//!     `recursion_vk_fingerprint(&self.root.0)` over the same root the envelope carries —
//!     so passing it as `expected_vk` fed the check its own answer (`found == found`). The
//!     pin could not fail. The whole-chain verifier's first tooth was inert on this path,
//!     leaving the ~31-bit head equality as the sole binding.
//!
//! **Neither repair alone would have sufficed**, and that is machine-checked, not asserted:
//! `Dregg2.Grain.R3Verify.neither_half_alone_suffices` proves the head-widened-but-still-
//! self-anchored form still admits a foreign circuit's root, and the VK-pinned-but-still-
//! lane-0 form still admits the ~2^31 grind. Widening the felt alone would have been a
//! green that means nothing (the
//! `Dregg2.Cell.InterfaceIdWidth.finalSqueezeOnly_still_conflates` failure shape).
//!
//! ### Where the expected VK comes from
//!
//! NOT the proof, and NOT a governance constant. The fingerprint is a function of the root
//! circuit SHAPE, which varies with `num_turns` and the leaf trace heights (per
//! [`WholeChainProof::root_vk_fingerprint`]), so no single pinned scalar can cover the fold
//! shapes R3 sees — unlike `DREGG_APEX_RECURSION_VK`, which pins the ONE fixed apex-shrink
//! shape. The correct source at this layer is therefore the caller: an honest-setup party
//! extracts the anchor ONCE from a fold it produced ITSELF ([`r3_setup_anchor`]) and holds
//! it out of band, exactly as `dregg_lightclient` splits `fold_and_attest` (SETUP — mints
//! the anchor, legitimately self-anchoring) from `verify_history` (VERIFIER — takes a
//! configured anchor). [`r3_verify`] is a VERIFIER: it renders a renter's accept decision,
//! so it belongs on the `verify_history` side of that split. The pre-fix module doc cited
//! `fold_and_attest`'s self-anchoring as precedent — but that is precedent for MINTING an
//! anchor, not for verifying against one.
//!
//! ## Honest scope — REDUCED to `EngineSound`, not closed
//!
//! `r3_unfoolable` is a genuine *reduction plus head-binding*, not an unconditional
//! proof of unfoolability: it reduces the grain's [`crate::WHOLE_HISTORY_GAP`] to the
//! named `RecursiveAggregation.EngineSound` boundary (the FRI/recursion legs proved
//! *outside* Lean, plus the single-turn apex's still-open reconciliation). GIVEN that
//! soundness, R3 accepts only genuinely-executed, correctly-ordered, non-truncated
//! histories bound to THIS grain's head. So R3 here is the maximal real subset *above*
//! the STARK floor — the floor itself is the carried, honest hypothesis, not a claim
//! this rung discharges. **The width repair adds no floor:** the widened head equality is
//! exact 8-lane equality and the VK equality is exact 32-byte equality; the ~124-bit
//! strength of the 8-felt anchor is the already-carried Poseidon2 state-commit floor.
