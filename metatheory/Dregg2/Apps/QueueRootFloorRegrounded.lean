# `Dregg2.Apps.QueueRootFloorRegrounded` — the `RootCR` / `LeafCR` / `PairCR` / `LenBindCR`
consumers RE-GROUNDED off the FALSE-AS-NAMED injective floors onto REAL collision games carrying
explicit `Eff`s.

## The bug this closes (VACUITY-SWEEP FINDING 2, the `Apps/QueueRoot` cluster — 4 carriers)

All four queue-root carriers are stated as **injectivity**:

  * `RootCR root := ∀ ls₁ ls₂, ZeroFree ls₁ → ZeroFree ls₂ → root ls₁ = root ls₂ → ls₁ = ls₂`
  * `LeafCR leafHash := ∀ a b, leafHash a = leafHash b → a = b`
  * `PairCR combine := ∀ a b a' b', combine a b = combine a' b' → a = a' ∧ b = b'`
  * `LenBindCR bindLen := ∀ n x m y, bindLen n x = bindLen m y → n = m ∧ x = y`

The deployed scheme is `blake3_binary_root` over `hash_entry` (`storage/src/commitment.rs`,
`storage/src/queue.rs`): every one of these maps a domain into a BOUNDED 256-bit digest, so each is
**FALSE at deployed parameters by pigeonhole** (§1). Every consumer conditioned on them —
`dequeue_proof_pins`, `dequeue_forgery_refused`, `stale_proof_refused`, `dequeue_proof_unique`,
`queueDequeueProven_pins_root_transition`, `queueDequeueProven_refuses_forgery`,
`queueDequeueProven_refuses_stale`, `tagged_dequeue_proof_pins` — is therefore **VACUOUSLY TRUE** at
real parameters. `#assert_axioms` is blind: the proofs are clean; the HYPOTHESIS is the flaw.

## ⚑ THE ZERO-FREE RESTRICTION IS RESPECTED, NOT DODGED — this is the delicate part

`RootCR` does NOT claim full injectivity. `QueueRoot` itself proves full injectivity FALSE for the
padded scheme (`refRoot_pad_alias` / `padded_root_not_fully_injective`: `root [1,2,3] = root [1,2,3,0]`
— padding is indistinguishable from a zero leaf), which is exactly WHY the carrier is restricted to
ZERO-FREE lists. A false-proof that merely re-exhibited the padding alias would prove nothing new and
would miss the carrier.

So §1 refutes `RootCR` **on its own restricted domain**: `zfRep n := List.replicate (n+1) 1` is an
INFINITE family of pairwise-distinct ZERO-FREE lists (`zfRep_zeroFree`, `zfRep_injective`), so a
range-bounded root collides on two of THEM (`exists_zeroFree_collision_of_finite_range`). The
restriction buys nothing against counting: the zero-free lists are still infinite, the digest is still
bounded. `rootCR_false_blake3` is the deployed form.

## The re-grounding (the `HermineHashCRRegrounded` concurrent-forgery pattern)

The deployed dequeue path rests on TWO carriers at once, and a forger breaks EITHER — so this is a
genuine **DICHOTOMY with a union bound**, exactly like `HermineHashCRRegrounded`'s concurrent-forgery
keystone, not a single-leaf bound:

  * **§3 `dequeueForgeryGame`** — a first-class λ-indexed game: the adversary is handed a sampled
    instance (the tag, the live pending window `head :: rest`) and WINS iff it produces a proof that
    VERIFIES against the live root yet claims a DIFFERENT entry or remaining list. The forgery is IN
    the win relation, read off the REAL `verifyDequeue` (which mirrors `verify_dequeue_proof`
    verbatim) — nothing here is a docstring.
  * **§4 the two extractors + the dichotomy.** `forgeryToRootFinder` hands over the two committed
    windows; `forgeryToLeafFinder` hands over the two entries. `forgery_wins_imp` proves the real
    dichotomy: wherever the forger wins, EITHER the two windows are DISTINCT zero-free lists with one
    root (a genuine ROOT collision) OR they are equal, forcing `remaining = rest`, so the claim
    differs in the ENTRY while the leaves collide (a genuine LEAF collision). `forgery_adv_le` is the
    UNION BOUND over the shared sampled-instance space.
  * **§5** — `dequeue_proof_pins_advantage_bound` &c: the Boolean "an admitted proof PINS the
    transition" / "a forged claim is REFUSED" become "EXCEPT with negligible probability", from the
    two collision floors VIA the reduction.

## ⚑ THE `Eff` PARAMETERS ARE THE WHOLE HONESTY, AND THEY ARE UNDISCHARGED

The sweep's load-bearing result (`FloorGames` §2, `hard_top_iff_solvableFrac_negl`): at the
UNRESTRICTED adversary class a game floor IS the existence floor, hence FALSE wherever collisions
exist — and §1 proves they exist at the deployed root AND at the deployed leaf hash. §7 prices both
poles at THESE carriers. `Eff` is a PARAMETER, in the open, at every use site: this tree has no cost
model (`FloorGames` §8), and inventing a shallow imitation would be another costume.

## Scope — HONEST

FULLY re-grounded: the DEPLOYED dequeue path (`RootCR` + `LeafCR`), via the dichotomy reduction.
FALSE-PROVED but NOT game-re-grounded: `PairCR` / `LenBindCR` (§8), the carriers of the PROPOSED §7
level-tagged hardening (`taggedRoot_injective`) — which Rust has NOT adopted (a wire-affecting root
format change, per `QueueRoot`'s own ⚠). Their repair path is stated in §8 and is mechanical: the same
`Deployment` + collision-game + extractor shape as §2-§5, at `tRoot`/`bindLen`. Re-grounding a
hardening that is not deployed is lower value than refuting it honestly, which §8 does.

## Non-fake

Both floors are REFUTABLE on broken deployments (§7) and the reduction is LOAD-BEARING (§6's canary:
the keystones do NOT follow from the floors applied at OTHER adversaries). The OLD consumers are KEPT
untouched and doc-marked at the teeth; siblings ADDED. `#assert_all_clean`; no `sorry`, no fresh
`axiom`.

## Coordination

This is the QUEUE-ROOT lane. `KeySetCR` is `Apps.PreRotationKeySetRegrounded`; `RosterCR` is
`Circuit.CouncilRosterRegrounded`; the STARK/FRI/Merkle hash consumers are
`Circuit.FloorRegroundedConsumers` / `Circuit.Poseidon2KeyedBridge`; the commit-reveal side is
`Crypto.HermineHashCRRegrounded` (whose `winProb_le_add_of_imp` union bound this file reuses rather
than duplicating).

and the honest refutation is pigeonhole on cardinalities, exactly the shape of
`HashFloorHonesty.hashCR_false_of_compressing`. Being precise about which teeth fire on which carrier
is part of the repair. -/

/-! ## §2 — the DEPLOYED QUEUE DEPLOYMENT: domain separation is the key.

The deployed root and leaf hash are FIXED unkeyed functions; their effective key is the
domain-separation tag (`TAG_QUEUE_ENTRY`, the derive-key prefix the leaf hash already uses) — the
standard keyed-from-unkeyed model (`Poseidon2KeyedBridge` §1-§2), and what stops the "hardcode a known
collision" degeneracy that collapses an unkeyed floor. -/

/-- **The deployed queue-root commitment scheme.** `root` / `leafHash` are the tag-keyed deployed
functions; `head` and `restEntries` are the LIVE pending window at the sampled instance (the head
entry and the entries behind it); `leafNonzero` is the `QueueRoot.LeafNonzero` carrier — BLAKE3
preimage resistance, which is NOT an injectivity floor and is NOT refuted by §1. -/

/-! ### ⚑ THERE IS NO OLD-FLOOR ⟹ NEW-FLOOR BRIDGE HERE, AND THAT IS THE POINT.

A theorem `leafFamily_CR_of_leafCR` sat here: `LeafCR` at every tag ⟹ the `⊤`-class collision floor on
`leafFamily D`, argued as "the OLD floor was STRICTLY STRONGER, so re-grounding loses nothing".
**BOTH ENDS ARE REFUTED.** §1b kills the injective `LeafCR` at a compressing entry hash; §7's
`leaf_floor_top_false_of_compressing` kills the `⊤`-class floor at the SAME hash. An implication
between two propositions that are both FALSE at deployed parameters transports nothing, and "loses
nothing" was FALSE as written — the floor it re-grounded ONTO is refuted at a real BLAKE3 too. So the
bridge is DELETED rather than restated at the unrestricted class.

What stands in its place is not another rung-1 bridge but this module's OWN poles at its OWN games,
which is why the bridge could be dropped rather than replaced: §7 prices `EffR` and `EffL` exactly
(`root_floor_top_false_of_compressing` / `leaf_floor_top_false_of_compressing` against
`root_floor_bot_vacuous` / `leaf_floor_bot_vacuous`) and refutes the root floor on a broken deployment
(`brokenQueue_root_floor_top_false`); §7b then lands both layers where the floor is a THEOREM
(`dequeue_proof_pins_binds_rom`, the keyed ROM, dichotomy intact). -/

the win relation on purpose: without them the game would be won by the padding alias
(`QueueRoot.refRoot_pad_alias`), which is a STRUCTURAL fact about the padded scheme and not a hash

wins: the verifier's first check plus the live-root pin force the two committed windows to share a
root, and BOTH are zero-free (the claim by the win condition, the live one because it is a leaf image
and leaves are nonzero). So EITHER the two windows are DISTINCT — a genuine ROOT collision inside
`RootCR`'s own restricted domain — OR they are EQUAL, whence `remaining = rest` (cons-injectivity), so
the claim must differ in the ENTRY while the two leaves collide — a genuine LEAF collision.

/-! ## §5 — the RE-GROUNDED CONSUMERS. -/

/-- **⚑ RE-GROUNDED `QueueRoot.dequeue_proof_pins` / `dequeue_forgery_refused` — from ROOT collision
resistance AND LEAF collision resistance, VIA the reduction.**

Under the root-collision floor at the game the reduction attacks AND the leaf-collision floor at the
entry hash, a dequeue forger whose extracted finders are in the floors' adversary classes has
NEGLIGIBLE advantage: an admitted proof PINS the head-dequeue transition EXCEPT with negligible
probability, and a forged claim is REFUSED EXCEPT with negligible probability. The Boolean pins become
the additive negligible advantage — which is what a real BLAKE3 can actually deliver, and what the
FALSE injective floors were standing in for.

Unlike its predecessor this statement is FALSE if you delete the reduction: the conclusion is about
the forgery game, the hypotheses about the two collision games, and `forgery_adv_le` is the only
bridge (§6's canary compiles that fact).

⚑ **THE `hEffR`/`hEffL` OBLIGATIONS ARE UNDISCHARGED AND THAT IS THE HONEST STATE** — the standard
"the reduction is efficient" side conditions, PARAMETERS because this tree has no cost model
(`FloorGames` §8). Both floors are priced exactly by §7: `⊤` makes them FALSE at the deployed BLAKE3,
`⊥` vacuous. The DISCHARGED successor — on the PROVED keyed-ROM floor, forger an oracle program with
query-counted cost, dichotomy intact — is §7b's `dequeue_proof_pins_binds_rom`. -/

`verifyDequeueAgainst` against the live `message_root`, whose structural leg is the `verifyDequeue` the
forgery game already carries and whose live-root leg is the game's `p.oldRoot = …` conjunct — so a

forgery game. Under the OLD free hypotheses (`hRC : RootCR root`, `hLC : LeafCR leafHash`, with
hypothesis and conclusion sharing the same free `root`/`leafHash`) this tooth was unwritable. It
compiles now, and reds if a future edit reconnects the games. -/

/-! ## §7b — ⚑ THE KEYED-ROM SUCCESSOR: the dequeue dichotomy DISCHARGED on the PROVED floor.

§5's `_advantage_bound` keystones are the honest fixed-hash statements; their `hroot`/`hleaf`
`Hard … Eff` hypotheses are PARAMETERS with no known non-vacuous instantiation (§7: `⊤` FALSE at the
deployed BLAKE3 root and leaf, `⊥` vacuous, no cost model). The DISCHARGED successor moves the floor
where it is a THEOREM: the keyed random-oracle model (`Crypto.KeyedRomFloor.keyedRom_hard`, the
birthday bound), the forger an ORACLE PROGRAM with QUERY-COUNTED cost, the oracle sampled AFTER the
program is fixed. The dichotomy survives INTACT: the composed dequeue forgery is a `RomForgery` whose
win relation NESTS the oracle (the window absorbs the entry's leaf digest, which is itself an oracle
answer), and the union bound runs over the ONE sampled oracle both layer carriers share
(`RomCarrierSites.chained_rom_binds` — the `Exec.SystemRootsBindingReduction.cellRoots_binds_rom`
pattern; the root-layer extractor RE-QUERIES the two leaf digests, paying `+2` queries).

⚑ **THE MODELLING STEP, STATED (not smuggled)** — `RomCarrierSites`' header caveat, inherited: the
sampled `H` replaces the fixed public `blake3_binary_root`/`hash_entry` (a deliberate labelled
idealisation, NOT a derivation); the digest space is `λ`-growing where the deployed digest is a FIXED
256-bit value; the message domain is the TRUNCATED deployed shape — a pending window of at most `m`
remaining leaves beside the head leaf limb (`Fin (2 ^ l) × BVec (Fin (2 ^ l)) m`, the deployed
`leafHash head :: rest` nesting with the leaf limbs oracle answers), domain-separated by constructor
from the entry-leaf shape inside ONE family. ⚑ The interior binary-tree structure of
`blake3_binary_root` is deployed-side: the model commits the window in ONE query (the digest-layer
coarse-graining, exactly `SystemRootsBindingReduction`'s `rootsRomCarrier` move). The zero-free side
condition of `rootCollisionGame` has no ROM counterpart because the padding alias it guards against
is a property of the FIXED padded scheme, not of the sampled oracle — the truncated window shape
carries its length tag instead, which is the honest version of the same discrimination. -/

/-! ## §8 — `PairCR` / `LenBindCR`: FALSE-PROVED (the §7 hardening's carriers).

These two carry the PROPOSED level-tagged hardening (`QueueRoot` §7, `taggedRoot_injective`), which
Rust has NOT adopted — switching `blake3_binary_root` to the tagged scheme changes every queue
`message_root` on the wire, so it needs a coordinated root-format migration (`QueueRoot`'s own ⚠).
They are refuted here as named; game-re-grounding a hardening that is not deployed is lower value than
refuting it honestly, and the repair path is mechanical: the same `Deployment`/collision-game/extractor
shape as §2-§5, instantiated at `tRoot`/`bindLen`, with `taggedRoot_injective`'s length-then-shape peel
as the win-preserving map. -/

/-- **⚑ THE HARDENING DOES NOT ESCAPE THE FINDING.** `QueueRoot.taggedRoot_RootCR` discharges `RootCR`
from `Function.Injective tagLeaf` + `PairCR` + `LenBindCR` — so if the hardened scheme's carriers held,
`RootCR` would hold. But §1a proves `RootCR` FALSE for any range-bounded root, and the tagged root IS
range-bounded at a real BLAKE3. Contrapositive: at the deployed digest the hardening's carrier
conjunction is itself FALSE. The upgrade fixes the PADDING ALIAS (a structural bug, and it really does
fix it — `tagged_kills_pad_alias`); it does NOT and cannot fix the counting bug. Only the `Eff`
parameter does. -/
