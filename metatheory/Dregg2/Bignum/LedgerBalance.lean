# Dregg2.Bignum.LedgerBalance — the SIGNED ledger balance, read at the width it is actually carried.

**SUBSTRATE, SAID OUT LOUD: this is Lean.** Everything here is a Lean model of the deployed felt
encoding plus INSTANTIATIONS of `Dregg2.Bignum`. No constraint is hand-written in Rust by this
module, no descriptor is registered, no emit path is touched, no VK moves. The `Constraint`-level
gate ties this work would eventually ride are already Lean-authored and already proved
(`Dregg2.Bignum.subLimbEqn_is_gate` / `addLimbEqn_is_gate`); nothing new is authored in Rust.

## The object

`dregg_cell::CellState::balance` is an **`i64`** (`cell/src/state.rs:204`) — SIGNED by design: THE
EPOCH §5's signed value model, where the issuer well legitimately carries `−supply`
(`CellState::well_debit_balance` `:759`, `apply_balance_change_well` `:1137`, both of which permit a
NEGATIVE result, unlike `debit_balance` `:740`).

That signed `i64` reaches the circuit and the light client through ONE encoder:

```rust
// turn/src/rotation_witness.rs:106-117 — the r0/r2 rotated-block weld values
pub fn balance_lo_felt(balance: i64) -> BabyBear { split_u64(balance as u64).0 }
pub fn balance_hi_felt(balance: i64) -> BabyBear { split_u64(balance as u64).1 }
// circuit/src/effect_vm/helpers.rs:13-17
pub fn split_u64(val: u64) -> (BabyBear, BabyBear) {
    let lo = (val & 0x3FFF_FFFF) as u32;   // low 30 bits
    let hi = (val >> 30) as u32;           // "upper 34 bits" — then BabyBear::new REDUCES mod p
    (BabyBear::new(lo), BabyBear::new(hi))
}
// turn/src/executor/proof_verify.rs:92 — the documented inverse
let balance = lo | (hi << 30);
```

Two facts follow and neither is decoration:

1. the cast `balance as u64` is **two's complement** — the sign is not encoded, it is *reinterpreted*;
2. the high limb is a 34-bit quantity pushed into ONE BabyBear felt, so `BabyBear::new` **reduces it
   mod `p`** — the encoder is not injective.

`§2` and `§3` state both as theorems over ℤ, at the deployed constants. `§4` states the tooth that
DOES catch (2) and shows it does NOT catch (1). `§5`–`§7` are the `Dregg2.Bignum` adoption.

## What is PROVED here

  * `sign_wound_survives_the_range_check` — `−1` encodes to two limbs that BOTH satisfy the deployed
    in-circuit 30-bit range proof, and the documented inverse reads a value above `10^18`.
  * `deployedEnc_not_injective` — two distinct balances, identical limbs, identical commitment.
  * `aliasing_dominated_in_circuit` — and why (2) is nonetheless the LESSER of the two: the 30-bit
    range proof caps the admitted join at `2^60 < 2^30·p`, so the alias partner is out of range.
    (1) has no such tooth. **A wound with a tooth and a wound without one must be priced apart.**
  * `deployedDebit_is_bignum_sub` — the DEPLOYED frozen-`bal_hi` debit gate *already is* a
    `Dregg2.Bignum.SubValid` witness at two limbs, with the amount's high limb pinned `0` and the
    inter-limb borrow structurally forced to `0`. The repair is therefore not a new construction: it
    is un-pinning one column.
  * `deployedDebit_cannot_cross_limb` / `bignum_admits_cross_limb_spend` — the same honest spend the
    deployed gate cannot witness IS witnessed by the two-limb borrow chain. The frozen high limb is
    a LIVENESS wall, not a hardening.
  * `balLimbs_injective`, `debit_exact`, `debit_iff`, `debit_underflow_unsat`, `credit_*` — the
    library instantiated at the deployed limb base.

## What is NOT proved here (read this before quoting anything above)

  * **That the Rust producer computes `deployedLo`/`deployedHi`.** That is a Rust↔Lean
    correspondence, not a Lean theorem, and writing it as one would be a name rather than a proof.
    The instrument that would pin it is a differential test against `balance_lo_felt` /
    `balance_hi_felt`, in the shape of `circuit/tests/effect_vm_commit_lean_differential.rs`.
  * **That any deployed descriptor's emitted gate set entails `DeployedDebit` at its columns.**
    `DeployedDebit` is transcribed from `EffectVmEmitTransfer`'s gate list; the weld to
    `Satisfied2`/`transferAvail_derives_availability_row` is not made here.
  * **Anything about the hardened `*Avail` faces' 15-bit borrow chain.** That closure is real and
    deployed (`docs/FINDING-modp-wrap-forgery-audit.md`); it hardens the LOW limb. Nothing here
    weakens it and nothing here re-litigates it.
  * `biasedLimbs_valid` carries the module's ONE `sorry` — see §7.

/-- `split_u64(balance as u64).0` — the low balance limb the trace and the `r0` weld carry.
(`Int`'s `%` is `emod`, which is non-negative for a positive modulus, so this IS the u64 cast
followed by the 30-bit mask.) -/

/-- `split_u64(balance as u64).1` — the high balance limb, AFTER `BabyBear::new`'s mod-`p`

/-! ## §2 — THE SIGN WOUND.

The issuer well's balance is legitimately negative. The encoder is a two's-complement
reinterpretation, so a negative balance is not rejected, not flagged, and not out of range — it is
read as a very large positive one. -/

/-- The low limb of `−1` is `2^30 − 1`: the largest value the low limb can hold. This is the number
a consumer that reads `BALANCE_LO` alone — which is what the Lean refinement tower welds the kernel
ledger to (`CircuitCompleteness.lean:280-283`, `srcPre.balLo = pre.kernel.bal tr.src a`) — sees for
a cell whose true balance is `−1`. -/

/-- The high limb of `−1` is `(2^34 − 1) mod p = 1073741815`. -/
theorem deployedHi_negOne : deployedHi (-1) = 1073741815 := by
  norm_num [deployedHi, wordMod, limbBase, babyBearP]

/-- ⚑ **THE HEADLINE.** The deployed in-circuit range proof pins both balance limbs into
`[0, 2^30)`. The encoding of `−1` satisfies BOTH pins — the high limb clears the bound by **nine** —
and the documented inverse reads back a value above `10^18`.

So: the tooth that exists (the 30-bit range proof, `fill_balance_limb_bits`) is not a tooth against
a NEGATIVE balance at all. A cell at `−1` presents a light-client-visible low limb of
`1,073,741,823` and a joined value of ~`1.15 × 10^18`. Nothing in the range discipline says
otherwise, because the range discipline was designed against a mod-`p` *wrap*, and this is a
two's-complement *reinterpretation* — a different failure with the same symptom. -/

`0 ≤ b < 2^60` the two limbs rejoin to `b` exactly. So §2 is a statement about the SIGNED and
OVER-WIDE domain specifically — it is not a claim that the encoder is broken everywhere, and a
repair must preserve this half. -/

identical per-cell commitment, since the commitment absorbs exactly `[bal_lo, bal_hi, nonce, …]`
(`circuit/tests/effect_vm_commit_lean_differential.rs:26-30`). The witness pair is
`0` and `2^30 · p = 2,161,727,822,211,579,904`, both inside `i64`. -/

/-! ## §4 — THE TOOTH, and what it does and does not reach.

⚑ The whole lesson of the felt-width re-pricing is that WIDTH BOUNDS THE IMAGE, IT DOES NOT PRICE
THE ATTACK. So both §2 and §3 must be priced against the teeth that actually run. There is exactly
one: the in-circuit 30-bit range proof on both limbs. It reaches §3. It does not reach §2. -/

/-- The 30-bit range proof caps the joined value at `2^60`. -/
theorem admitted_join_lt_2_60 {lo hi : ℤ}

    deployedJoin lo hi < limbBase * limbBase := by
  simp only [deployedJoin, limbBase] at hloB hhiB hlo0 hhi0 ⊢
  omega

/-- ⚑ **`aliasing_dominated_in_circuit`.** `2^60 < 2^30 · p`, so for any limb pair the range proof
admits, the alias partner from §3 is OUT of the admitted range. **The non-injectivity of the high
limb is DOMINATED wherever the in-circuit range proof runs** — it is live only on host paths that
call `split_u64` without it. Priced honestly, §3 ranks BELOW §2, which has no tooth at all. -/

  simp only [limbBase, babyBearP] at h ⊢
  omega

/-! ## §4b — THE SAME ENCODER WITH NO HIGH LIMB AT ALL: the note accumulator leaf.

`cell/src/commitment_set.rs:263-272` commits a note's `u64` value as `split_u64(value).0` — the LOW
limb ALONE:

```rust
pub fn accumulator_leaf(commitment: &[u8; 32], value: u64) -> HeapLeaf {
    HeapLeaf::entry(fold_bytes32_to_bb(commitment), split_u64(value).0)
}
```

and so does the nullifier set (`cell/src/nullifier_set.rs:458`) and both circuit twins
(`circuit/src/effect_vm/trace_rotated.rs:1568` `nf_value`, `:1805` `cm_value`). A `NOTE_VALUE_HI`
param column IS written (`circuit/src/effect_vm/trace.rs:743,753`) and is read by nothing.

This is the SAME `deployedLo` projection as the balance's low limb — but with no companion limb
committed anywhere, so §4's tooth has nothing to bite: the aliasing period is `2^30`, not `2^60`,
and it is a SOUNDNESS shape (the committed set cannot testify to the value the host credited)
rather than the balance's liveness shape. -/

/-- ⚑ **The accumulator leaf aliases at `2^30`.** Two note values a mere `2^30` apart — both far
inside `u64`, both perfectly ordinary — produce the SAME committed leaf value. Compare
`aliasing_dominated_in_circuit`: there the alias partner sat above the range proof's ceiling; here
there is no second limb and therefore no ceiling. -/
theorem accumulatorLeaf_aliases_at_2_30 :
    ∃ v w : ℤ, v ≠ w ∧ 0 ≤ v ∧ 0 ≤ w ∧ v < wordMod ∧ w < wordMod

/-! ## §5 — THE ADOPTION: the balance as a `Dregg2.Bignum` limb vector.

`balVal` is `CaveatBignum.bignumVal` at the deployed limb base — the SAME denotation every
`Dregg2.Bignum` keystone is stated over. Nothing is re-derived below; every theorem in this section
is an application. -/

/-- ⚑ **INJECTIVE — provably, not merely wider.** A ranged limb vector of fixed length is UNIQUELY
determined by the balance it denotes. Contrast `deployedEnc_not_injective`: the deployed pair is
non-injective *because* the high limb is reduced mod `p`, and the fix is not "more felts", it is
"every limb range-checked below the base". `Ranged` is the load-bearing hypothesis — drop it and the
statement is FALSE (`DigitInjective`'s own negative pole). -/

    balVal bal' = balVal bal - balVal amt :=

/-- ⚑ **THE ANTI-MINT TOOTH.** A debit exceeding the balance has NO witness. This is the

`EffectVmEmitMint.gBalHiFix:134`):

    new_bal_lo − old_bal_lo − amount = 0      (the move, on the LOW limb)
    new_bal_hi − old_bal_hi = 0               (the high limb FROZEN)

plus the 30-bit range proof on the after-limbs. `DeployedDebit` transcribes exactly that. -/

/-- ⚑ **THE ADOPTION THEOREM.** The DEPLOYED gate *already is* a `Dregg2.Bignum.SubValid` witness at
two limbs — with the amount's HIGH limb pinned to the constant `0` and, in consequence, the
inter-limb borrow forced to `0` by the frozen-`bal_hi` equation.

Read the other way: the repair is not a new construction and not new combinatorics. It is
**un-pinning one column** — letting the amount carry a high limb and letting the borrow be a real
witness bit — after which `debit_exact` / `debit_iff` / `debit_underflow_unsat` apply verbatim. The
hypothesis `0 ≤ hi < limbBase` is exactly the deployed 30-bit range proof on `bal_hi`; nothing is
assumed that the trace does not already carry. -/

/-- ⚑ **THE LIVENESS WALL, EXHIBITED.** A cell holding exactly `2^30` (limbs `[0, 1]`) spending ONE
unit — an entirely honest move, and the funds are genuinely there — has NO deployed-gate witness.
The high limb is frozen, so no borrow can cross the limb boundary, and the low-limb equation demands
`lo' = 0 − 1 = −1`, which the range proof refuses.

This is not a hardening. Every balance at or above `2^30` is unspendable down through the boundary,
and the `*Avail` borrow-chain hardening does not reach it: that chain runs on the LOW limb. -/

over-debit (soundness) and this exhibits the honest cross-limb spend (liveness). A repair that only

/-! ## §7 — THE SIGNED DOMAIN: what `Dregg2.Bignum` does NOT cover, and the bias that closes it.

`Dregg2.Bignum` is a NON-NEGATIVE positional system (`bignumVal_nonneg`), so a limbed balance can
never denote the issuer well's `−supply`. Adopting it for a SIGNED ledger therefore needs one more
step, and the tree already has the right one — on the BYTE path only:

    // cell/src/state.rs:1186
    pub fn balance_biased(balance: i64) -> u64 { (balance as u64) ^ (1u64 << 63) }

which is order-preserving and injective, and is used by `encode_balance_le`. The FELT path
(`balance_lo_felt` / `balance_hi_felt`) does **not** use it — it uses the raw cast. That divergence
between the two encodings of the same value is §2's root. -/

/-- The bias, over ℤ: `b ↦ b + 2^63`. (On `i64` the XOR of the sign bit and the addition of `2^63`
agree; over ℤ the addition is the honest statement.) -/

def biasedLimbs (b : ℤ) : List ℤ :=
  [ biased b % limbBase
  , biased b / limbBase % limbBase
  , biased b / limbBase / limbBase ]

/-- ⚑ **SORRY 1 of 1 — THE COMPLETENESS POLE.** Every `i64` balance HAS a valid three-limb biased
representation: the vector is ranged and denotes the biased balance.

**What would discharge it:** `Int.emod_nonneg` + `Int.emod_lt_of_pos` for limbs 0 and 1; for limb 2,
`Int.ediv_nonneg` plus `Int.ediv_lt_of_lt_mul` against `biased_range` and
`three_limbs_cover_biased`; then the value identity is two applications of `Int.emod_add_ediv`
(`biased b = (biased b % B) + B * (biased b / B)`, then the same on `biased b / B`) folded through
`bignumVal_cons` — the same two-step Euclidean unfolding `deployedJoin_faithful_on_range` does once.
It is bounded, mechanical work; it is a `sorry` because it is unfinished, not because it is doubtful.

**Why it is stated with a `sorry` rather than weakened:** the SOUNDNESS pole below
(`biasedLimbs_unique`) is proved outright and is the half that carries the security claim. The
tempting weakening — dropping `Ranged` from the uniqueness statement so both poles "close" — would
make the uniqueness theorem FALSE, not merely weaker (`DigitInjective`'s negative pole exhibits
`[128,0]` and `[0,1]` colliding at base 128 without it). ⚑ A wider encoder that is not PROVED
injective is the same bug with better optics. -/
theorem biasedLimbs_valid (b : ℤ) (h1 : -9223372036854775808 ≤ b) (h2 : b < 9223372036854775808) :
    (biasedLimbs b).length = 3 ∧ Ranged limbBase (biasedLimbs b)
      ∧ balVal (biasedLimbs b) = biased b := by
  sorry

/-- ⚑ **THE SOUNDNESS POLE — PROVED.** The three-limb biased representation is UNIQUE: a ranged
three-limb vector is determined by the balance it denotes. Together with `biased_injective`, two
DISTINCT signed balances have DISTINCT limb vectors — which is precisely what
`deployedEnc_not_injective` says the deployed pair does not do.

Note what this does NOT say: it says nothing about the HASH that absorbs the limbs (that is a
separate, computational, `Poseidon2SpongeCR` assumption), and nothing about any emitted column. It
is the packing layer only. -/

Every theorem above that could be true for free is exhibited firing in both directions here. -/

-- The deployed encoder ALIASES: two distinct balances, one limb pair.
example : ∃ a b : ℤ, a ≠ b ∧ deployedLo a = deployedLo b ∧ deployedHi a = deployedHi b :=
  deployedEnc_not_injective

-- …and the in-circuit range proof DOES exclude the alias partner (the tooth fires).
example : deployedJoin 5 7 < limbBase * babyBearP :=
  aliasing_dominated_in_circuit (by norm_num) (by norm_num [limbBase]) (by norm_num)
    (by norm_num [limbBase])

-- …but it does NOT exclude the sign wound (the tooth does not fire).
example : deployedHi (-1) < limbBase := (sign_wound_survives_the_range_check.2.1).2

-- The deployed gate REFUSES an honest cross-limb spend…
example : ¬ ∃ lo' hi', DeployedDebit 0 1 1 lo' hi' := deployedDebit_cannot_cross_limb

-- …and the limbed repair ADMITS it.
example : ∃ bal', DebitValid [0, 1] [1, 0] bal' := bignum_admits_cross_limb_spend

-- The anti-mint tooth FIRES on the limbed representation: 2^30 cannot pay 2·2^30.
example : ¬ ∃ bal', DebitValid [0, 1] [0, 2] bal' := by
  refine debit_underflow_unsat [0, 1] [0, 2] rfl ?_ ?_ ?_
  · exact ranged_pair (by norm_num) (by norm_num [limbBase]) (by norm_num)

  · exact ranged_pair (by norm_num) (by norm_num [limbBase]) (by norm_num)

`biasedLimbs_valid` is deliberately EXCLUDED — it carries the module's `sorry` and asserting it
clean would launder exactly the thing the `sorry` is there to keep visible. -/
