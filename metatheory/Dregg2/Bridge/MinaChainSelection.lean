# Dregg2.Bridge.MinaChainSelection — Ouroboros Samasika CHAIN SELECTION, in Lean.

⚑ **SUBSTRATE, SAID OUT LOUD.** This file authors **NO AIR**. Samasika chain selection is an
**OFF-CIRCUIT DECISION PROCEDURE**: it is what a node runs on two already-valid candidate tips to
pick one, and Mina itself never proves it in a SNARK (the in-circuit half of the density machinery
is `Min_window_density.Checked.update_min_window_density`, which computes a *block's own* density
during block production — a different function from the pairwise `select` this file implements).
So this is pure `Nat`/`Bool` Lean, exactly as `LightClientMina` / `LightClientSolana` are. Nothing
here is a `Builder` gadget and nothing here belongs in Rust. If a future lane wants selection
IN-CIRCUIT (e.g. a recursive proof that a tip is canonical), that object is a Lean-authored
`def`-generator + forcing lemmas — House Law #1 — and it does not exist yet.

## What this closes

`LightClientMina`'s header says, verbatim: "**FORK CHOICE IS NOT CHECKED.** Samasika's chain
selection appears nowhere in this file or anywhere else in the tree." That was true. This file is
the missing piece: a `select` that decides which of two tips is canonical, matched line-by-line
against the canonical implementation, with the structural facts about it PROVED rather than assumed.

## SOURCES — every rule below is cited to a line of a real implementation

Canonical (the OCaml daemon), `~/dev/mina` @ the working checkout:

| object | file:line |
|---|---|
| `select` (the top-level rule) | `src/lib/consensus/proof_of_stake.ml:2971-3078` |
| `is_short_range` | `src/lib/consensus/proof_of_stake.ml:2951-2967` |
| `Min_window_density.update_min_window_density` | `src/lib/consensus/proof_of_stake.ml:1221-1335` |
| `virtual_min_window_density` (inside `select`) | `src/lib/consensus/proof_of_stake.ml:3044-3063` |
| `Slot.in_seed_update_range` | `src/lib/consensus/slot.ml:9-13` |
| `Global_slot.epoch` / `Global_slot.slot` | `src/lib/consensus/global_slot.ml:77-83` |
| `Global_sub_window.of_global_slot` / `.sub_window` | `src/lib/consensus/global_sub_window.ml:10-18` |
| `Constants.create` (`grace_period_end`) | `src/lib/consensus/constants.ml:239-241` |
| `epoch_count` update (`+1` per transition) | `src/lib/consensus/proof_of_stake.ml:1129-1148` |

Second rendering (openmina / `mina-rust`, `crates/core/src/consensus.rs`): `is_short_range_fork:45`,
`relative_min_window_density:77`, `short_range_fork_take:126`, `long_range_fork_take:154`,
`consensus_take:190`. Spec document: `~/dev/mina/docs/specs/consensus/README.md` §5.2, §5.3.2,
§5.4.9, §5.4.12.

**Where the two disagree, this file follows the OCaml** — it is what mainnet runs and what the
in-circuit density update is checked against. The disagreements are not glossed: they are §8, and
they are proved, not asserted.

## CONSTANTS — real values, cited, never invented

All from `~/dev/mina/src/config/mainnet.mlh:15-20` (byte-identical in `devnet.mlh:15-20`):

| constant | value | line |
|---|---|---|
| `k` (depth of finality) | 290 | `mainnet.mlh:15` |
| `delta` | 0 | `mainnet.mlh:16` |
| `slots_per_epoch` | 7140 | `mainnet.mlh:17` |
| `slots_per_sub_window` | 7 | `mainnet.mlh:18` |
| `sub_windows_per_window` | 11 | `mainnet.mlh:19` |
| `grace_period_slots` | 2160 | `mainnet.mlh:20` |
| `slots_per_window` (derived) | 77 = 7·11 | `constants.ml:227` |
| `grace_period_end` (derived) | **2237** = 2160 + 77 | `constants.ml:239` |

⚑ The spec document's constants table (`README.md:96-113`) says `grace_period_end = 1440`, and
openmina hardcodes `const GRACE_PERIOD_END: u32 = 1440` (`consensus.rs:15`, with a `// TODO get
constants from elsewhere`). Both are **stale**: the daemon computes 2237. §8 turns that into a
theorem rather than a remark.

## SCOPE, honestly

Selection assumes the candidate tips are **already valid** — that their blocks verify, that their
VRF leader elections are legitimate, that the densities in them were honestly produced. None of
that is here (a sibling lane has VRF/stake). Samasika's own spec says this in as many words
(`README.md:918-922`): an implementation MUST reject invalid blocks and MUST NOT accept blocks for
future slots, or the sliding window is attackable. `select` is the tie-break AFTER those checks,
not a substitute for them.

Mirrors `Consensus_state.Poly` (`proof_of_stake.ml:1740-1760`) and the wire shape a node actually
serves. The fields BELOW the `-- not read by select` line are present on purpose: §6's
`select_reads_only_eight_fields` proves they cannot influence the verdict, and among them is
`epochCount` — the field openmina keys `is_short_range_fork` on. -/

/-- A Mina consensus state, as chain selection sees it. Field elements (checkpoints, seeds, keys)
are their NUMERIC value in `[0, p)` — the ordering the OCaml `compare` on

still being updated. Divides the CONSTANTS' `slots_per_epoch` (the OCaml asserts it is a multiple

is finalized), and `c1`'s next-epoch lock checkpoint IS `c2`'s staking-epoch lock checkpoint.

⚑ The `Slot.succ` is load-bearing and is the subtle part: the condition is
`not (in_seed_update_range (succ (curr_slot c1)))`, i.e. `curr_slot c1 ≥ 2/3·slots_per_epoch − 1`,
one slot EARLIER than a reading without the `succ`. openmina drops it (`consensus.rs:50` tests
`s2_epoch_slot >= slots_per_epoch * 2 / 3`), so the two implementations disagree on exactly the
boundary slot. -/

/-- **`isShortRange`** (`proof_of_stake.ml:2963-2967`). Same epoch ⇒ compare the two states'
STAKING-epoch lock checkpoints; different epochs ⇒ the adjacent-epoch case, tried in BOTH

`epoch_count`. -/

of the eight fields named here and of NOTHING ELSE the state carries. In particular it does not
depend on `epochCount` (which openmina keys its short-range test on), nor on `totalCurrency`,
seeds, start checkpoints, epoch lengths, the block producer, or the supercharge flag. A verifier

/-! ## §7 — ⚑ WHAT THE RULE IS **NOT**: `select` IS NOT A TOTAL ORDER. IT HAS 3-CYCLES.

This is the genuinely interesting structural fact about Samasika, and misreporting it would be
worse than not proving it. `select` is **irreflexive, asymmetric and total-up-to-key-equality**
(§6) — a *tournament*. It is **NOT transitive**, and not merely by an edge case: there are triples
of consensus states `A, B, C` with `B` selected over `A`, `C` over `B`, and `A` over `C`.

TWO independent mechanisms produce it, and BOTH are exhibited below as `decide`-checked witnesses:

  1. **MIXED REGIME.** `is_short_range` is not transitive (it is not even an equivalence across
     epochs), so different PAIRS are judged by different rules — `A ~ B` and `B ~ C` short-range
     while `A ~ C` is long-range. Realistic: `A` and `B` sit in the same epoch behind the same
     staking checkpoint, but only `B`'s next-epoch checkpoint got locked to `C`'s.

  2. **LONG REGIME ALONE.** Even when all three pairs are long-range, the "relative minimum window
     density" of a chain is NOT AN INTRINSIC SCALAR — it is a function of the PAIR, through
     `max_slot`. A chain's density is one number when it is the leading chain and a much smaller
     number when it is projected forward to a rival's later slot. So the comparison key itself
     changes per comparison, and a cycle costs nothing.

CONSEQUENCE FOR A LIGHT CLIENT, stated plainly: **`select` is a pairwise decision, not a "best
chain" function.** Folding it over a set of candidates is order-dependent, and a peer feeding
candidates in an adversarial order can walk a node around a cycle indefinitely. Any use of this
rule must therefore fix the comparison set and the order — which is exactly what the anchored
segment in `LightClientMina` gives (see §9). -/

/-! ## §8 — ⚑ THE SECOND RENDERING DISAGREES. openmina's chain selection is not the daemon's.

`mina-rust/crates/core/src/consensus.rs` transcribes the SPEC DOCUMENT's §5.4.12 pseudocode rather
than the daemon's `update_min_window_density`, and the spec document's §5.4.12 is itself
inconsistent with its own §5.4.9. Three separate defects compound:

  1. **The shift count is measured in SLOTS, not SUB-WINDOWS.** §5.4.9 says "if `next` is `k`
     SUB-WINDOWS ahead we must shift `k − 1` times"; §5.4.12's code writes
     `max_slot - B1.curr_global_slot - 1`, a SLOT difference, and `consensus.rs:88` copies it. With
     `slots_per_sub_window = 7`, a one-sub-window advance becomes a six-shift.
  2. **One extra zero.** `consensus.rs:101` is `for _ in 0..=shift_count` — `shift_count + 1`
     iterations — where the spec's own pseudocode is `while shift_count > 0`.
  3. **The wrong grace-period end.** `consensus.rs:15` hardcodes `GRACE_PERIOD_END = 1440` with a
     `// TODO get constants from elsewhere`; the daemon computes `2160 + 77 = 2237`.

And in the short-range check, `consensus.rs:49` keys on `epoch_count` where the daemon keys on
`curr_global_slot / slots_per_epoch`, and `consensus.rs:50` drops the daemon's `Slot.succ`.

`relMinWindowDensityOpenmina` below is that rendering, so the disagreement is a THEOREM. -/

minimum window density of `divA` measured against `divB`, one sub-window ahead. The daemon says
**50** (a one-sub-window advance zeroes NOTHING: `prev_rel = 9`, `next_rel = 10`, and the "within
range" set `{i : 9 < i < 10}` is empty). openmina says **23**. The spec document's own pseudocode
says **28**. -/

without the daemon's `Slot.succ` before `in_seed_update_range`. -/

/-- A chain whose `epoch_count` LAGS its `curr_epoch` — which happens on the real chain after any
fully-empty epoch, because `epoch_count` is incremented by ONE per transition regardless of how
many epochs were skipped (`proof_of_stake.ml:1130-1140`). Here `curr_epoch = 2`,
`epoch_count = 1`. -/

the adjacent-epoch case and calls this a SHORT-range fork; openmina (keyed on `epoch_count`: 1 vs
1) falls into its same-epoch branch, compares STAKING checkpoints (777 vs 888), and calls it LONG.

`short_range_fork_take` (`:126`) and `long_range_fork_take` (`:154`). The tie-break chain below the
density is the same lexicographic (length, VRF, state hash) as the daemon's, so `select` and
`selectOpenmina` differ ONLY through `isShortRange` and the density — which is exactly what makes
the differential in `MinaChainSelectionDifferential` diagnostic rather than merely red. -/

/-! ## §9 — THE LIGHT-CLIENT SEAM.

`LightClientMina.minaVerify` decides an ANCHORED SEGMENT: linked, Pickles-proved, `k` deep from a
governance-pinned weak-subjectivity anchor. Its own header names the hole — "a `k`-deep linked
proved segment from a DIFFERENT anchor is not refused by anything here" — and
`LightClientMinaGate`'s ordered remainder names fork choice as item 4.

**What the gate can decide once `select` exists that it could not before**: given TWO accepted
updates `u₁, u₂` (each linked, proved and `k`-deep, possibly under different anchors), it can now
rank their tips and refuse the loser. That is the function below. It is stated at CURRENT
resolution, and the resolution has three named limits:

  * `select` is a TOURNAMENT, not an order (§7). `minaBetterTip` is therefore a comparison of TWO
    named tips, never a fold over a set — folding is order-dependent and cyclable. A light client
    that must choose among many candidates has to fix the comparison set first; the anchored
    segment is what fixes it.
  * The inputs `select` reads are NOT all available from the public GraphQL surface the deployed
    `bridge/src/mina_observer.rs` uses. Measured 2026-07-29 against
    `api.minascan.io/node/devnet`: `blockHeight`, `epoch`, `slot`, `minWindowDensity`,
    `lastVrfOutput` and both `lockCheckpoint`s ARE served, and **`subWindowDensities` is not a
    field of the GraphQL `ConsensusState` at all**. So the LONG-RANGE branch cannot be evaluated
    from GraphQL; it needs the binprot protocol state. The short-range branch can.
  * Selection assumes both tips are already VALID. Here that assumption is discharged by
    `LightClientMina.MinaValidAt` for each side — which is exactly why this belongs at the light
    client and not in front of it.
-/

/-- **`minaBetterTip`** — the fork-choice decision over two candidate tips. `true` means the
CANDIDATE tip wins and the existing one must be dropped. This is `select` with the light client's
naming; it is the object a gate would export. -/
def minaBetterTip (C : Constants) (existing candidate : ConsensusState)
    (existingHash candidateHash : Nat) : Bool :=
  select C existing candidate existingHash candidateHash == SelectStatus.take

/-- **THE LIGHT-CLIENT PROPERTY THAT WAS MISSING.** Two `k`-deep proved segments under different
anchors are no longer indistinguishable: `minaBetterTip` decides between them, it decides the same
way whichever side is presented first (`select_asymm`), and it never prefers a tip to itself
(`select_irrefl`). -/
theorem minaBetterTip_decides (C : Constants) (a b : ConsensusState) (ha hb : Nat) :
    (minaBetterTip C a b ha hb = true → minaBetterTip C b a hb ha = false)
    ∧ minaBetterTip C a a ha ha = false := by
  constructor
  · intro h
    simp only [minaBetterTip, beq_iff_eq] at h ⊢
    rw [select_asymm C a b ha hb h]; simp
  · simp [minaBetterTip, select_irrefl C a ha]

/-- ⚑ **AND THE HONEST LIMIT, AS A THEOREM.** `minaBetterTip` cannot be folded over a candidate
set: the very same states that cycle in §7 make "the best of `{A, B, C}`" depend on the order they
arrive in. This is why the seam is a PAIRWISE comparison against a fixed anchored segment and not
a `List.foldl`. -/

    minaBetterTip mainnet lcycA lcycB 1 2 = true
