# Dregg2.Bridge.MinaVrfThreshold — Samasika's VRF LEADER ELECTION threshold, in Lean.

⚑ **SUBSTRATE, SAID OUT LOUD.** This file authors **NO AIR**. It is pure `Nat`/`Int`/`Bool` Lean.
Mina's threshold does have an in-circuit life (`Threshold.Checked.is_satisfied`,
`consensus_vrf.ml:346-381`, proved for every block by the blockchain SNARK), but what is authored
here is the *unchecked* decision procedure — `Threshold.is_satisfied`, `consensus_vrf.ml:326-344`
— which is what an off-circuit checker runs. Nothing here is a `Builder` gadget and nothing here
belongs in Rust. An in-circuit version on our side would be a Lean-authored `def`-generator plus
forcing lemmas (House Law #1); it does not exist and this file does not pretend to be it.

## The rule, exactly

A delegator wins a slot when

    vrf_output / 2^253  ≤  c · (1 − (1 − f)^(my_stake / total_stake))

with `c = 2^0 = 1` and `f = 3/4`, so `base = 1 − f = 1/4`. The comment above the OCaml
(`consensus_vrf.ml:323-325`) writes the divisor as `2^256`; the code divides by
`2^Output.Truncated.length_in_bits` and that is **253**, not 256 —
`length_in_bits = min 256 (Field.size_in_bits − 2)` (`consensus_vrf.ml:208`) and Tick is Pasta Fp
with `size_in_bits = 255`. openmina carries the corrected value with the OCaml derivation quoted
in a comment (`crates/vrf/src/threshold.rs:183-186`, `crates/ledger/src/proofs/block.rs:765`).

⚑ `c` is not a rounding detail that got dropped: `c_bias` (`consensus_vrf.ml:159-161`) implements
multiplication by `c = 2^i` as *dropping `i` low bits of the VRF output*, and at the production
value `i = 0` it is the identity. So the `c` in the formula is genuinely absent from the deployed
arithmetic rather than silently folded in.

**`1 − base^x` is NOT computed in closed form.** It is a truncated Taylor series over fixed-point
rationals — `Snarky_taylor.Exp` (`src/lib/snarky_taylor/snarky_taylor.ml:107-249`) — because it
has to be computable in a SNARK. §1 reproduces its parameter derivation rather than asserting the
numbers, and §2 proves the derivation lands on the constants openmina hardcodes.

## THE VRF ITSELF IS NOT IN THIS FILE, AND THAT IS THE SCOPE FACT

`Vrf.eval sk m = H_MinaVrfOutput(m ‖ (sk · H_MinaVrfMessage→group(m)).x ‖ …y)` on Pallas
(`integrated.ml:92-95`) — Poseidon over Pasta plus a group map. Modelling *that* means modelling
Poseidon and the Pallas group map, which live elsewhere in this tree
(`Dregg2/Circuit/Emit/Pasta*.lean`, `PastaPoseidon.lean`) and are not re-derived here. What this
file authors is the part the threshold rule actually decides with: the comparison against the
stake-scaled bound, given an already-computed 253-bit VRF output.

⚑ And there is a harder fact than that, in §5: the threshold is only half of leader election, and
the other half is not something a light client holds.

/-! ## §1 — The fixed-point Taylor parameters, DERIVED rather than asserted.

`Snarky_taylor.Exp.params ~base:(1/4) ~field_size_in_bits:255` (`consensus_vrf.ml:317-319`)
computes, at OCaml module-initialisation time:

* `abs_log_base = |log(1/4)|`, where `log` is the 100-term series
  `Σ_{i=1}^{100} (−1)^{i+1} (x−1)^i / i` (`snarky_taylor.ml:42-49`) — NOT the real logarithm;
* `(per_term_precision, terms_needed, total_precision)` from `bit_params`
  (`snarky_taylor.ml:133-145`);
* coefficients `⌊2^per_term_precision · (|log base|^i / i!)⌋`, alternating in sign, with the `i=1`
  term split into a whole part and a fraction (`snarky_taylor.ml:163-186`).

Everything below is integer arithmetic over an *unnormalised* common denominator, so no rational
normalisation (and no `Nat.gcd`) is needed to evaluate it. `absLogNum / absLogDen` is exactly the
OCaml's `abs_log_base`. -/

/-- `n!`, written out so kernel reduction stays on GMP-backed `Nat` multiplication. -/
def fact : Nat → Nat
  | 0 => 1
  | n + 1 => (n + 1) * fact n

/-- Common denominator for the 100-term `log` series at `x = 1/4`: `4^100 · 100!`. Using `100!`
rather than `lcm(1..100)` keeps the derivation free of `Nat.gcd`, whose well-founded recursion the
kernel does not reduce cheaply; it is a larger denominator for the same exact rational. -/
def absLogDen : Nat := 4 ^ 100 * fact 100

/-- Numerator of `|log(1/4)|` under `absLogDen`. With `a = x - 1 = -3/4` every term of
`Sum (-1)^(i+1) a^i / i` is `-(3/4)^i / i`, so the absolute value is `Sum (3/4)^i / i`. -/
def absLogNum : Nat :=

def taylorCoeffRaw (i : Nat) : Nat :=
  (2 ^ perTermPrecision * absLogNum ^ i) / (absLogDen ^ i * fact i)

/-- The whole part of the linear coefficient, split out as `snarky_taylor.ml:173-178` does. It is
`1` here, i.e. `Coeff_integer_part.One` / openmina's `CoeffIntegerPart::One`. -/
def linearTermIntegerPart : Nat := absLogNum / absLogDen

/-- The coefficient list Mina actually uses: `i = 1` contributes only its FRACTIONAL part (the
whole part is carried separately), the rest contribute in full. -/

/-! ## §2 — The derivation lands on the deployed constants.

openmina hardcodes the coefficient array (`crates/ledger/src/proofs/block.rs:317-345`) because
the circuit cannot compute it. Re-deriving it from `f = 3/4` alone and getting the same eleven
integers is the check that neither side invented a number. -/

chosen `k = 16` satisfies the guard and `k = 17` does not — which is what pins
`per_term_precision = 20`. -/

    termsNeeded * perTermPrecision + perTermPrecision < 255 ∧
    ¬ (12 * 21 + 21 < 255) ∧

/-! ## §3 — The threshold predicate.

`is_satisfied` (`consensus_vrf.ml:326-344`):

* `input = ⌊2^20 · my_stake / total_stake⌋ / 2^20` — the stake fraction, QUANTISED to
  `per_term_precision` bits (`:330-338`);
* `rhs = one_minus_exp params input` = `Σ_{i=1}^{11} ±cᵢ·inputⁱ / 2^20 + 1·input`
  (`snarky_taylor.ml:195-211`);
* `lhs = vrf_output / 2^253` (`:228-234, 343`);
* the verdict is `lhs ≤ rhs` (`:344`).

Both the OCaml (`Bignum`) and openmina's native path (`BigRational`) evaluate this in EXACT
rationals, and the circuit's `Floating_point` accumulates precision rather than truncating
(`snarky_taylor.ml:213-249`), so all three agree with the exact integer form below. Put over the
common denominator `2^240 = 2^(20·12)`, `rhs = thresholdNumerator / 2^240`, and

/-! ### §4.1 — Monotonicity in stake.

`polyNumerator` is a degree-11 alternating polynomial; that it INCREASES on `[0, 2^20]` is not
visible from its coefficients, which decrease and change sign. It is proved here by exhibiting
the forward difference in the **Bernstein basis** of `[0, 2^20]`: if

    2^(20·9) · (P(n+1) − P(n)) = Σ_{k=0}^{9} b_k · n^k · d^(9−k)   with   n + d = 2^20

and every `b_k ≥ 0`, then the difference is non-negative for every `n` in range, because `n` and
`d` are. The nine `b_k` below are the Bernstein coefficients; the identity is a polynomial one and
`ring` checks it. -/

/-- The ten Bernstein coefficients of `2^180 · (P(n+1) − P(n))` on `[0, 2^20]`. They are all
NON-NEGATIVE, and stating them as `Nat` is exactly that fact: there is nothing to prove about
their signs because the type carries it. -/

/-! ### §5.1 — What a light client would additionally need. STATED, not footnoted.

`isSatisfied` decides leader election given `(vrf_output, my_stake, total_stake)`. A light client
holding only block headers has **none of the three** in checkable form:

1. `my_stake` is `winner_account.balance` read out of the **staking epoch ledger** at
   `winner_addr`, under a checked Merkle path against `epoch_ledger.hash`
   (`proof_of_stake.ml:718-731, 765`). The header carries the ledger HASH, not the ledger. A
   client must therefore hold, or be served with, a Merkle inclusion proof for the winner's
   account in a ledger of ~6200 accounts on devnet — per block.
2. `total_stake` is `staking_epoch_data.ledger.total_currency`, which IS in the header — this one
   is free.
3. `vrf_output` in the header is `Vrf.Output.truncate producer_vrf_result`
   (`proof_of_stake.ml:2014`), the truncated 253-bit hash. Recomputing it needs the delegator's
   *secret* scalar (`eval sk m = H(m, sk·H₂(m))`, `integrated.ml:92-95`), so a verifier cannot
   recompute it at all — it can only be *proved*, and Mina proves it inside the blockchain SNARK,
   which is also where the `Threshold.Checked.is_satisfied` constraint lives
   (`proof_of_stake.ml:747-772`).

⚑ **So: leader election is NOT checkable by a light client from headers alone, and no amount of
work on this file changes that.** The honest statements are:

* A client that verifies the **Pickles proof** inherits the threshold check, because the SNARK
  already constrains it. That is the route `LightClientMina` is on, and for it this file is a
  *specification* of what the proof is asserting, not an independent check.
* A client that wants to check leader election **without** the proof needs the staking epoch
  ledger (or per-block Merkle proofs into it) AND a standalone VRF verification — and Mina has no
  standalone VRF verifier: openmina's `mina_vrf` is evaluation-only, with verification existing
  nowhere outside the SNARK.
* The **sliding density window** (sibling file `MinaSlidingWindow`) is different in kind: it is
  computable from two consecutive headers and nothing else. That asymmetry is the real scope
  result of this lane — of Samasika's two mechanisms, one is header-checkable and one is not. -/

/-- `@[export]` seam. Callers pass the truncated VRF output as a `Nat` (little-endian, 253 bits),
the winner's balance in nanomina, and the epoch ledger's `total_currency`. -/
