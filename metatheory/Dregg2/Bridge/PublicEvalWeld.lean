# Dregg2.Bridge.PublicEvalWeld — the witnessed-inverse `p(ζ)` IS the shipped `publicEval`.

## What this closes

`MinaWrapFtEval0` §2 says it plainly: "inverses, WITNESSED rather than trusted. Nothing below
assumes the modulus is prime." §7 adds that recomputing `p(ζ)` "is `public_len` inverses, and §2's
witnessed device supplies them **without a `Field` instance**."

That device was the right call when there was no `Field (ZMod qN)` — and it is what
`MinaWrapFtEval0Weld` uses to recompute block 539508's `p(ζ)` and `p(ζω)` from the Wrap side's forty
public words. But it made `publicEvalAt` a **second spelling** of `KimchiVerify.publicEval`, and
nothing welded the two. That is the same shape `cipR_eq` / `ftEval0R_eq` exist to close for `cipR`
and `ftEval0R`, and `publicEval` had no such theorem: the real-block leg was evidence about
`publicEvalAt`, not about the shipped definition.

`Fact (Nat.Prime qN)` (`Dregg2/Circuit/Emit/PastaScalarPrime.lean`) makes the weld statable at the
field the Wrap side actually computes in.

## §1 is a gap this file found on the way

`powFast` — square-and-multiply, used for `ω^i`, `x^n`, `α^21` and the Fermat ladder `x^(m−2)`
throughout the Wrap leg AND in `EmitConformanceVectors` — had **no correctness theorem**. Its only
tie to `^` was `powFast_is_pow`, a `decide` on **four** small cases (`3^0`, `3^1`, `3^7`, `5^40`).
Four cases is not a ladder. `powFast_eq_pow` below is the theorem, for every monoid and every
exponent the fuel covers.

/-! ## §4 — the weld. -/

/-- **`publicEvalAt_is_publicEval`** — ⚑ whenever the witnessed device SUCCEEDS, its answer is the
shipped `KimchiVerify.publicEval`'s answer. So `MinaWrapFtEval0Weld`'s block-539508 checks —
`p(ζ)` and `p(ζω)` recomputed from the Wrap side's forty public words, plus the three
slot-tamper poles — are evidence about the SHIPPED definition, not about a second spelling of it.

`none` is a refusal and carries no claim: it is what the device returns at `x = ω^i`, where the
Lagrange form is undefined and where `publicEval` (following kimchi) returns 0 regardless. The
hypothesis is exactly that the device did not refuse.

The `powFast` side condition is discharged by `powFast_eq_pow` at any exponent under `2^512`. -/

/-! ## §5 — ⚑ THE SHIPPED DEFINITION, ON THE REAL BLOCK, AT THE DEPLOYED WRAP FIELD.

Everything above is generic. This is the point of it: `KimchiVerify.publicEval` — the `[Field F]`-
typed shipped definition — evaluated at `ZMod qN` on Mina devnet block 539508's forty public input
words, reproducing the `p(ζ)` that kimchi computed.

⚑ THIS COULD NOT BE WRITTEN YESTERDAY. `publicEval` needs `⁻¹`, so it needs a `Field`; `ZMod qN`
became one this morning. `MinaWrapFtEval0Weld`'s existing checks run `publicEvalAt`, the
witnessed-inverse spelling — and §4 is what makes those checks evidence about THIS definition. Here
the shipped definition is run directly, so the two routes to `p(ζ)` are both measured against
kimchi's own value rather than against each other. -/
