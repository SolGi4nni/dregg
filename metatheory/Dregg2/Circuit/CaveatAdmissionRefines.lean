# Dregg2.Circuit.CaveatAdmissionRefines — the in-circuit caveat-admission gadget REFINES the
  reified `CaveatPred` metatheory (the DREGGFI §7 caveat-in-circuit weld, Lean half).

This is the Lean refinement obligation (`docs/deos/EFFECTVM-SIDESTRUCTURE-ABI.md §3.6`) for the
in-circuit caveat-admission leaf
(`circuit-prove/src/caveat_admission_leaf_adapter.rs`). That leaf makes the DECIDABLE caveat
atoms a genuine IN-CIRCUIT admission: it WITNESSES a per-atom slack `s = ceiling − request` and
RANGE-CHECKS `s ∈ [0, 2^BOUND_BITS)`, so an OVER-authorized trade (past expiry / over budget /
wrong asset) has a wrapped-negative slack the range lookup REFUSES ⇒ UNSAT ⇒ no foldable leaf.

## What this file proves (the bridge circuit ⟷ Caveat.lean)

The gadget's arithmetic admission — the conjunction of `0 ≤ ceiling − request` slack facts — is
EQUIVALENT to `Token.admits` of the mandate's reified caveat chain (each atom a `Caveat.pred`
carrying its own request `view`, exactly `Dregg2/Authority/Caveat.lean`'s `CaveatPred` vocabulary):

  * `validUntil t`  — the expiry ceiling  (`req_time  ≤ t`), the circuit's `slack_vu ≥ 0`;
  * `heightLt   h`  — the strict ceiling  (`req_height < h`), the circuit's `slack_hl ≥ 0`;
  * `budget     b`  — the spend ceiling   (`trade_value ≤ b`), a `validUntil`-shaped `≤` atom
                      over the value view (the `Dregg2/Agent/Mandate.lean` budget);
  * asset scope     — `trade_asset = a`, expressed inside the reified vocabulary as
                      `validAfter a ∧ validUntil a` over the asset view (`a ≤ asset ∧ asset ≤ a`).

So the AIR FAITHFULLY EVALUATES the caveat predicate: `inCircuitAdmits ↔ token.admits`
(`inCircuit_iff_tokenAdmits`, BOTH poles, non-vacuous). And the in-circuit-admitted request is IN
the token's admissible set — with `attenuate_narrows`, it is in the LESS-attenuated parent's set
too (`inCircuit_admitted_narrows`), and an admitting token is a `Laws.Discharged` verify/find
witness (`inCircuit_admitted_discharges`, reusing `token_discharges`). This is the refinement
"the admitted request is in the attenuated set" the weld owes — turning the decidable-caveat slice
of "the mandate IS the proof" from executor-trusted into venue-verifiable.

## HONEST SCOPE (named, not overclaimed)

This refines the DECIDABLE atoms only. `Caveat.opaque` (an arbitrary `Ctx → Bool`) and
`Caveat.thirdParty` (a gateway discharge) are NOT reified and NOT forced in-circuit — a mandate
carrying such an atom stays executor-trusted for that atom. Pure, `#eval`-able, `sorry`-free.

lies in the parent's admissible set — the "admitted ⊆ the attenuated set" direction the weld owes,
