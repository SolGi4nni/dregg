# Dregg2.Circuit.ChainStepNonTautology — the E-guarantee, de-tautologized.

**Survey finding #2 (the E-guarantee tautology), addressed head-on.**

`Distributed.HistoryAggregation.ChainStep` (line 172) bundles the executor witness
`commits : recCexec pre turn = some post` as a STRUCTURE FIELD. Consequently:

  * `HistoryAggregation.every_turn_executed_correctly` (line 347) is `fun s _ => s.commits` —
    provable for ANY `List ChainStep` whatsoever, with no verification hypothesis in sight;
  * the `every_turn` field of `RecursiveAggregation.AggregateAttests` (line 187) therefore adds
    NOTHING an adversary must fear: "every turn executed correctly" is baked into the TYPE of the
    steps list, not extracted from `verify agg.root`. We EXHIBIT this below
    (`every_turn_is_free`, `every_turn_says_nothing`): the conjunct is logically `True`.

  (To be fair to the original design: `ChainStep` is the SPEC-side interpretation the soundness
  hypotheses pair proofs against — the real content of `AggregateAttests` was always in the OTHER
  three fields, the two public root pins and `ChainBound`. But the E-guarantee prose headlines
  "every turn executed correctly", and THAT conjunct is the free one.)

Meanwhile the REAL adversarial statement — `Crypto.LightClientUC.unfoolable_of_floor` (line 159)
/ `fooling_breaks_floor` (line 170): a no-secret light client can only be made to ACCEPT a
non-produced state by BREAKING the named crypto floor (STARK/Fiat-Shamir extractability + the
CR binding) — is pinned in `AssuranceCase` (§E, `#assert_axioms` at :704–:705) but NEVER CONJOINED
into the deployed E-statement (`unfoolability_guarantee`, AssuranceCase:666, which conjoins only
`AggregateAttests` + conservation).

**The deliverable (`light_client_E_genuine`).** ONE statement conjoining exactly the genuine,
non-free content:

  (1) the public GENESIS root pin      (`AggregateAttests.genesis_pinned`),
  (2) the public FINAL root pin        (`AggregateAttests.final_is_genuine_fold`),
  (3) the `ChainBound` ordering tooth  (`AggregateAttests.ordered` — no reorder/drop/insert),
  (4) the ADVERSARIAL dichotomy, in `CollisionReduce.OrBreak` form: the light client is
      `Unfoolable` UNLESS the extractability floor is broken (`OrBreak (¬ExtractsTo) Unfoolable`),
  (5) the contrapositive with teeth: any successful fooling attack CONSTRUCTS a floor break
      (`Foolable → ¬ExtractsTo` — exactly `fooling_breaks_floor`).

**Where the adversarial content comes from (and where it does NOT).** Conjuncts (4)–(5) are proved
by `fooling_hardness_from_floor` below, whose statement and proof mention NO `ChainStep`, NO
`Aggregate`, NO `steps` — only the light-client game (`Foolable`/`Unfoolable`) and the floor
carriers (`ExtractsTo`/`SatBindsProduced`). The fooling-hardness comes from the FLOOR (threaded
honestly: the binding carrier `hBind` is a hypothesis; extractability stays INSIDE the statement as
the `OrBreak` break event / the implication's antecedent, so nothing is vacuous by assumption).
`ChainStep.commits` is never consulted for it — it CANNOT be, since no `ChainStep` occurs in
(4)–(5). Conjuncts (1)–(3) come from `light_client_verifies_whole_history` under `EngineSound` +
`verify agg.root = true`; we deliberately DROP its `every_turn` field from the conjunction, because
`every_turn_says_nothing` shows it is free.

**FIRE (both polarities), on the honest chain.** The hypotheses are satisfiable on the REAL 1-step
honest executor chain (`RecursiveAggregation.realSteps` over `teethGenesis`, engine soundness
`real_engine_sound`) with the LightClientUC reference instance: the honest twin resolves the
`OrBreak` to the GOOD branch (`fire_unfoolable`, via `refExtractsTo`) and yields a concrete
rejection fact (`fire_rejects_unproduced`: no proof makes the sound client accept the non-produced
state `3`); the broken twin (`badVerify`, accepts everything) is FORCED into the real break branch
(`fire_twin_forced_broke`) and conjunct (5) extracts the concrete floor break
(`fire_twin_breaks_floor`). So the dichotomy is a real discriminator, not a formal husk.

Does NOT edit `AssuranceCase`/`HistoryAggregation`/`RecursiveAggregation` — pure strengthening on top.

/-! ## §1 — THE TAUTOLOGY, exhibited (which part of the E-guarantee was free).

`ChainStep.commits` is a structure field, so "every turn executed correctly" holds for EVERY
`List ChainStep` — no aggregate, no verifier, no soundness hypothesis. These two theorems are the
INDICTMENT, not the deliverable: they prove the `every_turn` conjunct of `AggregateAttests` (and
hence that conjunct of `AssuranceCase.unfoolability_guarantee`) carries zero adversarial content.
The `↔ True` shape is deliberate — it is the finding itself, machine-checked. -/

/-- **The free conjunct.** For ANY list of `ChainStep`s — no `verify`, no `EngineSound`, no
aggregate anywhere — "every turn executed correctly per the verified executor" holds, because the
executor witness is a FIELD of `ChainStep`. This is verbatim the content of
`HistoryAggregation.every_turn_executed_correctly` and of `AggregateAttests.every_turn`; restated
here hypothesis-free to make the freeness impossible to miss. -/
theorem every_turn_is_free (steps : List ChainStep) :
    ∀ s ∈ steps, recCexec s.pre s.turn = some s.post :=
  fun s _ => s.commits

/-- **The conjunct says nothing.** The `every_turn` proposition is logically `True` for every
steps list: as a conjunct of an attestation it adds no constraint an adversary must satisfy.
(The REAL constraints of `AggregateAttests` are the other three fields — the two public root pins
and `ChainBound` — which `light_client_E_genuine` keeps.) -/
theorem every_turn_says_nothing (steps : List ChainStep) :
    (∀ s ∈ steps, recCexec s.pre s.turn = some s.post) ↔ True :=
  iff_true_intro (every_turn_is_free steps)

/-! ## §2 — The adversarial core, PROVED WITHOUT `ChainStep`.

The genuine "unfoolability" content of guarantee E is the LightClientUC reduction: a no-secret
client can only be fooled by breaking the floor. We package it as the two conjuncts
`light_client_E_genuine` will carry, and prove them in a statement in which NO `ChainStep`,
`Aggregate`, or steps list occurs — so the fooling-hardness demonstrably does NOT ride
`ChainStep.commits`. The binding carrier (`SatBindsProduced`, the sponge-CR/StateCommit
injectivity shape) is threaded honestly as a hypothesis; the extractability carrier
(`ExtractsTo`, the STARK/Fiat-Shamir floor) is NOT assumed — it is the `OrBreak` break event in
(a) and the antecedent target in (b), so neither conjunct is vacuous-by-assumption. -/

/-- **`fooling_hardness_from_floor` — the E-guarantee's adversarial content, `ChainStep`-free.**
Under the binding carrier alone:
  (a) `OrBreak (¬ExtractsTo) Unfoolable` — the client is unfoolable, UNLESS the extractability
      floor is broken (the collision-reduce dichotomy; good branch = the real security verdict);
  (b) `Foolable → ¬ExtractsTo` — a successful fooling attack CONSTRUCTS a concrete break of the
      STARK/Fiat-Shamir floor (`fooling_breaks_floor` verbatim).
(a) rides `unfoolable_of_floor` on the `ExtractsTo` case split; (b) is the contrapositive with
teeth. No `ChainStep` occurs in this statement or proof. -/

/-! ## §3 — THE DELIVERABLE: `light_client_E_genuine`.

The non-tautological E-statement: the two public root pins + the `ChainBound` ordering tooth
(the genuine content of `AggregateAttests`, its free `every_turn` field DROPPED) conjoined with
the adversarial fooling-hardness (§2). Hypotheses are exactly the existing keystones':
`EngineSound` + `verify agg.root = true` for the pins/ordering (as in
`light_client_verifies_whole_history`), and the binding floor carrier `hBind` for the adversarial
part (as in `fooling_breaks_floor`) — extractability is never assumed, only concluded about. -/

/-- **`light_client_E_genuine` — guarantee E with the tautological conjunct removed and the
adversarial reduction conjoined.** A light client that checks ONLY `verify agg.root = true` learns
  (1) the public genesis root is pinned to the chain's start,
  (2) the public final root IS the genuine fold of the whole history,
  (3) the chain is correctly ordered (`ChainBound` — no reorder/drop/insert),
and, from the floor (NOT from any `ChainStep` field),
  (4) the no-secret light client is `Unfoolable` UNLESS the STARK/Fiat-Shamir extractability floor
      is broken (`OrBreak` dichotomy), and
  (5) any successful fooling attack constructs a concrete floor break (`Foolable → ¬ExtractsTo`).

What is deliberately ABSENT: the `every_turn` conjunct — `every_turn_says_nothing` proves it is
`True` for every steps list (it rides the `ChainStep.commits` field), so conjoining it would
launder a type-level triviality as a verification result. Conjuncts (4)–(5) are produced by
`fooling_hardness_from_floor`, whose statement contains no `ChainStep` at all: the
fooling-hardness comes from the floor carriers, threaded honestly (`hBind` assumed; `ExtractsTo`
concluded-about, never assumed). -/

/-! ## §4 — FIRE, both polarities, on the honest chain.

Hypothesis satisfiability is witnessed on the REAL instances the codebase already carries:
  * aggregate side — `RecursiveAggregation.realSteps` (the honest 1-step executor chain over
    `teethGenesis`, `recCexec teethGenesis honestTurn = some _` discharged by `decide`), with
    `real_engine_sound : EngineSound …` and the accepting root (`hroot := rfl`);
  * game side — the LightClientUC `Reference` instance (`refVerify`/`refSat`/`refProduced`,
    binding `refSatBinds` PROVED), and its broken twin `badVerify` (accepts everything).
The honest twin lands in the GOOD branch with a concrete rejection consequence; the broken twin is
FORCED into the real break branch and conjunct (5) extracts the floor break. -/

(`Reference.refExtractsTo` is PROVED), so the §3 `OrBreak` conjunct RESOLVES to its good branch:
