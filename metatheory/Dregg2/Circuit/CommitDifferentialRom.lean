# `Dregg2.Circuit.CommitDifferentialRom` — the deployed `CellState::compute_commitment` bindings
(`record_digest`, `cap_root`) as REDUCTIONS on the PROVED keyed-ROM floor.

## What this replaces, and why a disjunction could not be the export

`CommitDifferential` models the deployed per-cell commitment (the `hash_4_to_1` two-level nest over
the ordered 13-limb list, `record_digest` at index 12, `cap_root` at index 11) and exported its
binding as `…_or_collides` DISJUNCTIONS — "the limb is bound OR here are the colliding quads". At
deployed BabyBear parameters a collision of the compressing `ℤ⁴ → ℤ` compress EXISTS by pigeonhole
(`InjectiveFloorRegrounded.compress4_not_injective_babyBear`), so a bare disjunction holds through
its right branch with NO binding: it is an extractor witness, not a security statement.

The security statement lives here. The deployed 13-column nested commitment at the SAMPLED oracle
is `EffectVmRowCommitReduction.narrowRomCommit` — `H (t, inr ((H(t,A), H(t,B), H(t,C)), d))` over
the three GROUP-4 state blocks and the record-digest felt — and its full equivocation is already
priced by `narrowRow_binds_rom` (the two-carrier union bound on `keyedRom_hard`, the birthday
bound, PROVED). This module supplies the two LOCALIZED tamper forgeries the `CommitDifferential`
headlines state — the disagreement pinned to the `record_digest` felt, and pinned to the `cap_root`
slot inside block C — and closes each as a reduction INTO the full narrow forgery: a localized
disagreement is payload distinctness, so the tamper forger IS a narrow forger.

  * `effectVmCommit_binds_record_digest_rom` — the audit-P0-2 anti-ghost tooth, DISCHARGED: a
    query-bounded adversary cannot keep the published commitment while tampering the authority
    residue, except with negligible probability. Successor of
    `effectVmCommit_binds_record_digest_or_collides` (which is RETAINED in `CommitDifferential`
    as the extractor witness its `RotatedCommitDifferential` consumer still `rcases` on).
  * `effectVmCommit_binds_cap_root_rom` — the cap-root twin, DISCHARGED. Its disjunction
    predecessor `effectVmCommit_binds_cap_root_or_collides` had NO consumers and is DELETED from
    `CommitDifferential` in the same commit this lands.

## The named correspondence, pinned

`narrowValOfLimbs` is the 13-limb field correspondence at the truncated widths — the SAME block
partition the Rust nesting absorbs: `A = [bal_lo, bal_hi, nonce, fields[0]]`,
`B = fields[1..5]`, `C = [fields[5], fields[6], fields[7], cap_root]`, outer felt =
`record_digest`. The projection pins tie the two tamper coordinates to their
`CommitDifferential.effectVmLimbs` positions (`record_digest_at_index_12`; `cap_root` = C slot 3 =
index 11), and `narrowValOfLimbs_inj` is the losslessness tooth: distinct deployed limb tuples stay
distinct ROM payloads.

## ⚑ The modelling step (inherited, said out loud)

The `RomCarrierSites` header discipline: the sampled `H` replaces the fixed public `hash_4_to_1`;
inner digests are ideal `Fin (2 ^ l)` values (no `l` is the deployed ~31-bit felt); the fixed
hash's own collision resistance stays a conjecture. What the move buys over the disjunction: the
floor under the export is a THEOREM instead of a branch that is free at deployed parameters.

## Axiom hygiene

`#assert_axioms` ⊆ {propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}; no `sorry`, no fresh `axiom`, no
`native_decide`.
