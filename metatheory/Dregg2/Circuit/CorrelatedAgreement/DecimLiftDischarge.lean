# `Dregg2.Circuit.CorrelatedAgreement.DecimLiftDischarge` — ⚑ THE `DecimLift` HYPOTHESIS
DISCHARGED at the landed setup tower: the §5 interface theorem's decimation-lift weld is now a
THEOREM at the deployed 5-layer arity-8 schedule, and `ud_tower_far_survival` holds there with
one fewer hypothesis.

**What was carried (verbatim from `Interface.lean:653-658`).** `DecimLift` was named as "the
RS fold-geometry weld … TRUE for the deployed phase decomposition; its deployed-instance proof
is the setup-TOWER engineering `FriChainStepIdx`'s header names as missing (no welded
`FriSetupK` tower in-tree). Named, not faked." That justification is now STALE: the tower
LANDED (`FriSetupTower.towerS`, five welded arity-8 layers `2^19 → … → 2^4`, `tower_link`,
committed green). This file cashes the IOU.

**Why the tower discharges it (the exact comparison).** `DecimLift nn V m dec` demands: at
every layer `i`, if the `m` decimations `dec i w` agree SIMULTANEOUSLY with codewords
`g j ∈ V (i+1)` on all but `e` points of the folded domain, then `w` is `(m·e)`-close to
`V i`. At `dec := Cj` (the `FriFoldArity` components — the decimation whose moment-curve IS
the deployed fold: `towerFold_is_Fold` below is `rfl`) the three ingredients are exactly what
the tower landed:
  * `self_decomp` (`FriFoldArity:115`): `w x = Σ_j p(x)^j · Cⱼw(q x)` — off the disagreement
    fibers, `w` IS the reassembly of the `g j`;
  * `unfold_closed` (proved at every layer by `towerLayer`): `reassemble G g ∈ C` — the
    reassembled word is a LAYER-`i` codeword, the closeness witness;
  * `tower_link`: `(towerS i).C' = (towerS (i+1)).C` — so "`g j` in the NEXT layer's domain
    code" (the shape `DecimLift` states) IS "`g j` in THIS layer's folded code" (the shape
    `unfold_closed` consumes);
  * `pullback_card_le` (`FriFoldArity:161`): each bad fiber has `m` points — the `m·e`.
The generic engine is `setup_decimLift` (any `FriSetupK`); `decimLift_of_tower` instantiates
it down the welded family. Above the tower (layers ≥ 5) the instance `towerV` is `∅`, which
makes those layers' lift VACUOUS by construction — stated loudly: `DecimLift`'s STATEMENT is
untouched (no weakening); the finite-depth tower simply has nothing above layer 5, a
5-round chain never folds there, and `towerFar`/`towerE` never read `V` above layer 5.

**What lands.**
  1. `curveUDParam_exact` — the `r = 0` m-term UD correlated agreement over ANY linear code
     (the exact m-point Vandermonde solve), generalizing `Interface.curveUDParam_pair_exact`
     from `m = 2` to every `m`. This is the CA corner that lets the fire discharge `hCA`
     honestly at the `d = 0` radius schedule; the positive-radius CA remains the L1–L6 target.
  2. `setup_decimLift` — the generic lift over any `FriSetupK` (the BBHR18 reassembly weld).
  3. `decimLift_of_tower` — **`DecimLift twSz towerV 8 towerDec`, PROVEN** (the discharge).
  4. `ud_tower_far_survival_discharged` — the §5 interface theorem AT the tower instance with
     the `DecimLift` hypothesis REMOVED (`hlift` is now supplied by theorem 3). Remaining
     hypotheses: the radius schedule, the per-layer CA (the L1–L6 deliverable), initial
     farness — exactly the ones that SHOULD remain.
  5. `discharged_tower_fire` — **the strengthened corollary FIRES with EVERY hypothesis
     discharged** at the real tower: `m = 8`, five welded layers at the `2^19` production
     domain, the proven-far degree-`2^16` monomial `farWord`, radius schedule `d = 0`, CA
     from `curveUDParam_exact` — bound `5·(8−1)·(0+1)/|BabyBear| = 35/|BabyBear| < 2^-25`,
     reproducing `tower_chain_far_survival`'s number through the CA interface route (the two
     caps agree: `(m−1)(0+1) = 7 = n−1`). Contrast `Interface.tower_fire`, which fired at
     `m = 1` over RS(4,1)/ZMod 5.
  6. ⚑ 2026-07-24 — **the prover is QUANTIFIED**:
     `ud_tower_far_survival_discharged_strategy` is the same statement for an ARBITRARY
     `S : Strategy BabyBear (Σ i, Fin (twSz i) → BabyBear)` committing `w0` at round 0, gated
     only on the path-local `FoldConsistentAlong`; theorem 4 is now its honest instance
     (`honest_foldConsistentAlong` discharges the gate for free — nothing is lost), and
     `discharged_tower_fire_strategy` fires it at the real five-layer tower with a prover
     PROVEN not equal to `honestStrategy` (`towerOffpathS_ne_honest`), same `35/|BabyBear|`.
     `FriChainStepIdx.consistencyFreeSurvival_false` refutes the un-gated form outright.
     NOT proved here or anywhere in-tree: the other branch of the dichotomy — that a
     fold-INCONSISTENT prover is caught by the query phase.

**Honest scope.** The fire's CA instances are at radius 0 (exact agreement — the Vandermonde
corner, genuinely proven); the positive-radius `CorrelatedAgreementCurveUDParam` at the
deployed shaved radii is NOT claimed and remains the explicit hypothesis of the general
corollary (the L1–L6 target). This is a ROM/FS statement about honest-fold word evolution —
NOT prover soundness against the deployed verifier; the FRI floor posture is untouched.
Lean-authored throughout; there is no Rust AIR here and there must not be. ADDITIVE: no
existing theorem is edited.

/-! ## §4 — ⚑ NON-VACUITY: the discharged corollary FIRES with EVERY hypothesis met.

`m = 8`, the five welded layers at the real `2^19` production domain, the proven-far
degree-`2^16` monomial, radius schedule `d = 0`, CA from the exact Vandermonde corner
(`curveUDParam_exact`). Bound `5·7/|BabyBear| = 35/|BabyBear|` — the SAME number
`tower_chain_far_survival` proved through `goodδ_card_lt`, now reproduced through the CA
interface with its lift weld PROVEN: the CA cap `(m−1)(0+1) = 7` and the reconstruction cap
`n−1 = 7` agree at the degenerate radius, as they must. -/

/-! ### §4.1 — the STRATEGY-generic corollary fires at a prover that is NOT the honest one.

Firing the generalization only at `honestStrategy` would leave open the suspicion that
`FoldConsistentAlong` is a disguised way of saying "S = honestStrategy". It is not: the gate is
PATH-LOCAL, so a prover is free to behave arbitrarily off the 5-round path the oracle walks. -/

length ≤ 5 — the entire 5-round FS path — and commits the layer-0 word again beyond it, where
the honest prover would sit at layer ≥ 6. -/
