# `Dregg2.Circuit.Emit.AirColumnAlloc` — LIVENESS AND COLUMN REUSE for the lowering, and the
renaming under which the refinement survives it.

## ⚑ SAY THE SUBSTRATE OUT LOUD

**This is Lean-authored AIR, and a register allocator is part of the compiler, so it is Lean.**
Every column index and every renaming is computed here; Rust never sees an allocation decision.
House Law #1.

## ⚑ WHERE THE FRESH COLUMNS ARE MINTED — cited, and it is NOT the lowering

`EffectLowerCore.lowerAir` (`:437`) takes `traceWidth` as a **parameter** and
`assemble` (`:419`) copies it into the descriptor verbatim. The lowering therefore mints no
column at all: it is handed a width and a leg list whose column indices are already chosen. The
allocation lives one level up, in the gadget's layout arithmetic, and for the sound Pasta row it is
four `def`s:

    PastaCurveSound.lean:403   def vBase (fresh i : Nat) : Nat := fresh + SK * i
    PastaCurveSound.lean:405   def mWit  (fresh k : Nat) : Nat := fresh + SK * 33 + (SK + (NG-1)) * k
    PastaCurveSound.lean:407   def sWit  (fresh k : Nat) : Nat := fresh + SK * 33 + (SK + (NG-1)) * 12 + SK * k
    PastaCurveSound.lean:409   def aWit  (fresh k : Nat) : Nat := fresh + SK * 33 + (SK + (NG-1)) * 12 + SK * 2 + SK * k

Each is `base + stride * index`. **The index only ever goes up.** That is the whole naivety, in
four lines: `vBase` hands SSA value `i` a private 32-column block for every `i < 33`, `mWit` hands
multiply `k` a private 94-column block for every `k < 12`, and nothing is ever handed out twice.
`RCB_FRESH = 2856` (`:412`, `rcb_fresh_eq`) is the sum, and `RCB_WIDTH = 3048` (`:474`) is it plus
the six input blocks.

## ⚑ AND THE FIRST THING THE LIVENESS SAYS IS THAT THE ROW CANNOT SHRINK

The diagnosis "a fresh column per SSA value and never reuse one" is TRUE of the four `def`s above.
The inference "therefore a register allocator shrinks the row" is **FALSE**, and the reason is
structural rather than a matter of effort:

> **An AIR row has no time.** All 33 op blocks of `swCompleteAddSoundLegs` are asserted on ONE row
> simultaneously. Two values that share a column on one row are *the same field element*. So a
> column may be reused by two values only if their live ranges are disjoint — and within a single
> row every live range is the whole row.

`rcb_single_row_interference_is_complete` (§5) is that as a theorem: on the one-row schedule the
interference graph on the 39 value blocks is the COMPLETE graph, so `alloc_disjoint` forces the
allocation to be injective and 3 048 columns is **optimal**, not naive.

⚑ **The reuse opportunity is created by a SCHEDULE, not found by an allocator.** Spreading the 33
ops over rows is what gives live ranges an inside and an outside; the allocator is what then cashes
it. Both halves are here: `liveIntervals` over an op list (§3), greedy interval colouring with the
disjointness invariant proved (§4), and the two schedules measured against each other (§5).

## ⚑ THE INVARIANT IS NOT `Nodup` — and that is the whole difference from the other rail

`Emit/KimchiArena.lean` is the allocator on the Kimchi rail and its entire value is
`alloc_injective`: *"a successful alloc has `Nodup` variables, so two slots can never denote one
`PVar`."* **Reuse is the exact negation of that property.** This allocator therefore proves a
different theorem, and it is the one the brief names:

* `alloc_disjoint` — *two values sharing a column have disjoint live ranges*, general over the
  interval list, by construction rather than by a census.

## ⚑ WHAT KEEPS THE REFINEMENT — composition, in the `merging_is_naming_the_same_variable` shape

`KimchiAssertEqual.lean:333` proves a merged placement **is** `place` of the renamed gate list, so
no second pass has to be kept honest. Same shape here, one rail over:

* `renameLeg_forces` — a renamed leg forces at `env` exactly what the original leg forced at
  `env ∘ σ`. Stated in `AirLeg.forces`, the SOURCE semantics, and never mentioning `lowerLeg`.
* `renameAir_mainRailOk` — renaming does not move the compiler's verdict, so the certified
  lowering still elaborates.
* `allocated_forces_what_it_forced` — the certificate `lowerAirCertified` already produces for the
  renamed air, pulled back through `renameLeg_forces` to a statement about the ORIGINAL air.

⚑ **The soundness direction is free and the completeness direction is what the invariant buys.**
Renaming with ANY `σ` can only restrict: an assignment satisfying `renameAir σ air` pulls back
along `σ` to one satisfying `air`, so a reuse pass can never admit a witness the original refused
(`rename_admits_no_new_witness`). What a bad `σ` breaks is *completeness* — an honest witness stops
fitting — and `alloc_disjoint` is exactly the side condition that keeps it
(`disjoint_ranges_admit_the_honest_witness`).

`#assert_axioms`-clean; no `sorry`/`admit`/`native_decide`; zero `#guard`s.

/-! ### §1c — ⚑ THE THEOREM THE BRIEF ASKS FOR: the refinement survives the pass.

`AirLeg.forces` is the SOURCE semantics (`EffectLowerCertified.lean:110`) — it is stated in
`Expr.eval` / `WindowExpr.eval` / membership in `tf table` and never mentions `lowerLeg`. So this
is a fact about the source language, and the emitted refinement composes with it rather than being
re-derived. -/

/-- ⚑ **A RENAMED LEG FORCES, AT `env`, EXACTLY WHAT THE ORIGINAL FORCED AT `env ∘ σ`.**

An `Iff`, not an implication: the pass loses nothing and invents nothing. Both directions matter —
`→` is what says the allocated circuit is no weaker, `←` is what says it is no stronger, so the
pass cannot smuggle in a constraint the source never wrote. -/

/-! ### §1d — ⚑ WHICH DIRECTION IS FREE AND WHICH ONE COSTS AN INVARIANT.

This is the half a reuse pass is usually wrong about, so it is two named theorems rather than a
paragraph. -/

/-- ⚑ **NO `σ` CAN ADMIT A WITNESS THE SOURCE REFUSED.** Whatever the allocation — injective,
collapsing, absurd — a row window satisfying the allocated block yields a row window satisfying the
original: read the original's columns through `σ`. So a reuse pass is *sound by construction* and
the invariant is not what protects soundness.

This is the restriction fact: identifying two columns can only add the equation "these are equal". -/
theorem rename_admits_no_new_witness (σ : Nat → Nat) (tf : TraceFamily) (env : VmRowEnv)
    (isFirst isLast : Bool) (air : EffectAir) :
    (∀ l ∈ (renameAir σ air).legs, l.forces tf env isFirst isLast) →
      ∃ env', ∀ l ∈ air.legs, l.forces tf env' isFirst isLast :=
  fun h => ⟨renameEnv σ env, renameAir_forces σ tf env isFirst isLast air h⟩

/-- ⚑ …**AND WHAT THE INVARIANT BUYS IS THE OTHER DIRECTION.** An honest witness of the original
block still fits the allocated one exactly when the physical row can be *filled*: there must be an
`env` whose read-through-`σ` is the honest window. That is possible iff `σ` never identifies two
columns the honest witness gives different values — which is what disjoint live ranges deliver, and
§4 is where it is delivered.

Stated as the pullback existence it really is, so the hypothesis is visible rather than assumed. -/

/-! ## §2 — ⚑ THE ALLOCATED LOWERING, and it needs no new lowering.

`lowerAirCertified` already returns `{ d // CertifiedRefines d cs air }` for any air whose
`mainRailOk` holds (`EffectLowerCertified.lean:507`). §1b says the allocated air's verdict is the
original's, so the certificate is produced by the SAME emit — there is no second pass to keep
honest, which is the `merging_is_naming_the_same_variable` shape. -/

/-- ⚑ **THE ALLOCATED CIRCUIT FORCES WHAT THE UNALLOCATED ONE FORCED.**

`CertifiedRefines d cs (renameAir σ air)` — the certificate the emit hands back for the ALLOCATED
source — is pulled back to a statement about the ORIGINAL source's legs, read through the
allocation. No byte of the lowering is re-proved; `renameLeg_forces` is the whole bridge.

⚠ The conclusion is at `renameEnv σ env`, and that is the honest statement rather than a weaker
one: the original block's columns are not there any more, so what the descriptor forces about them
is forced *at the physical columns they were allocated to*. Claiming it at `env` would be claiming
the pass moved nothing. -/

/-! ## §3 — ⚑ LIVENESS over the SSA DAG.

A value's live range is `[def, last use]`, in the units the schedule counts in. On the one-row
schedule every op happens at time `0`, so every range is `[0,0]` and everything interferes; on the
one-op-per-row schedule op `i` happens at time `i`. Both are instances of the same definition,
which is the point — the schedule is an input to liveness, not a property of the DAG. -/

written this way and not as a state monad over a fresh counter.

/-! ### §5b′ — ⚑⚑ THE WIDTH THE PROVER ACTUALLY COMMITS, AND IT IS NOT THE DECLARED ONE.

`MainLayout::build` (`circuit/src/descriptor_ir2.rs:1919`) compiles every declared range lookup
into the declared column **plus a nibble aux block**, and `Ir2Air::Main` is `width()`d at the sum.
So a cost law read against `traceWidth` is read against the wrong denominator — measured by
`circuit-prove/tests/mina_accumulator_leaf_anatomy.rs::the_wrap_cost_tracks_committed_width_not_declared_width`,
`ops/declared` spreads 1.78× across two shapes while `ops/committed` spreads 1.12×: **the wrap cost
is LINEAR in committed width.**

⚑ And the consequence for a reuse pass is the one that matters: **71.7% of the sound row's
committed width is range-check decomposition**, which a register allocator does not touch at all.
What DOES touch it is the schedule — one op per row lets the per-op range lookups become per-POOL
range lookups — and that is where most of this cone's win actually comes from. -/

/-- ⚑ **THE DEPLOYED AUX-BLOCK GEOMETRY**, transcribed from `descriptor_ir2.rs:1870-1883`:

    decomp_cols(bits) = n + (if top < LIMB_BITS then top else 0)

with `LIMB_BITS = 4` (`:408`). ⚠ The partial-top term is NOT decoration: it makes a ONE-BIT lookup
cost **2** aux columns rather than 1, which is exactly the 19-column gap between a naive
`⌈bits/4⌉` model and the measured 7 708. -/

One op per row means the per-op private witness pools are sized by the WIDEST op, not by the sum
over 33 ops. And the pools are split by RANGE CLASS, which is a soundness requirement and not
tidiness: `Ir2Air::Main` hardcodes lookup multiplicity to `ONE`
(`circuit/src/descriptor_ir2.rs:3738`), so a declared range lookup fires on **every row** — a
physical column shared between an 8-bit limb slot and a 16-bit carry slot would be queried against
both tables at every row and refuse the honest witness. -/
