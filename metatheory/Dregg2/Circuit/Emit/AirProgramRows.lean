# `Dregg2.Circuit.Emit.AirProgramRows` — ⚑⚑⚑ THE ROW WINDOW **IS** A STEP OF THE INTERPRETER.

## ⚑ SAY THE SUBSTRATE OUT LOUD

**This is Lean-authored AIR.** Nothing here is a Rust gate, a Rust builder, or a Rust
`air_accepts`. Every fact cashed below is reached by MEMBERSHIP in
`MinaWrapVerifierProgram.programAir`'s own leg list — the list `lowerTiedAir` lowers — read through
`EffectAirIR.AirLeg.forces`, never re-typed. House Law #1.

## ⚑⚑ THE GAP THIS CLOSES, IN THE WORDS OF THE FILE THAT LEFT IT

`MinaWrapClosingAir` §b, 2026-08-09, after the seven transcript descriptors got their
`CertifiedRefines`:

> **obligation 2, which nothing in this tree discharges**: that a row window satisfying all the
> forced legs IS a step of `runProgAt` — the ALU relations, the one-hot routing, the register
> window and the ROM lookup composed over 2 048 rows into the interpreter's transition function,
> with the routing lemmas' `hsel` one-hot hypotheses supplied by the ROM manifest rather than
> assumed. […] **What is still absent is the composition**: no theorem assembles them into "row
> `k+1`'s register file is `stepRegsAt` of row `k`'s", and none inducts that over 2 048 rows to
> `runRowsAt`.

`rows_track_the_interpreter` (§8) is that theorem. `runs_the_program` (§9) is its `runProgAt` form,
and `MinaWrapVerifierSpongeFp.the_absorb_program_permutes_gen` composes onto it in §10.

## ⚑ THE SHAPE IS `AirCrossRow.rcbSat_of_rows`'s, AND THE PIECES MAP ONE TO ONE

| `AirCrossRow` (RCB row)              | here (the machine)                                  |
|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `carried_constant` — the one induction | `pc_is_the_row_index` + `rows_track_the_interpreter` |
| `gather` — 33 rows into 1 assignment | `regVal` — the register block a row PRESENTS         |
| `SlotsCarry` (discharged §7)         | `RowsForced` (the legs, at every row)                |
| `PoolsRanged` (still a premise there)| `RangeTablesHonest` (still a premise here — §11.1)   |

⚠ **EVERY COLUMN FACT IS STATED MOD `P`, AND THE REGISTER FILE IS NOW STATED OVER ℤ.** Keeping the
two apart is most of the work:

* **`P` — BabyBear.** `AirLeg.forces` on a `gate`/`window` is `body ≡ 0 [ZMOD PMOD]` with
  `PMOD = P` by `rfl`, so every COLUMN fact this file derives is a congruence mod `P`. A register
  column is NOT range-checked by `programAir` (§11.2), so `tr t (regCol r + i)` is known only up to
  `P` — which is exactly why `regVal` reads it through `· % P`.
* **`N` — the Pasta modulus.** The ALU's conclusion is a DIVISIBILITY,
  `N ∣ sVal x · sVal y − sVal z`, so the arithmetic relay runs mod `N`.
* ⚑⚑ **AND `Tracks` IS AN ℤ EQUALITY** — `regVal a r = st r`, no modulus. It was a congruence mod
  `N` until 2026-08-10 and could not have been anything else: no leg was a less-than-the-modulus
  certificate on `z`, so `r, r+p, … r+4p` all fit inside the `2^256` window `z`'s limb ranges buy.
  `MinaWrapVerifierProgram.zCanonLegs` is now a leg of `programAir`, `z_is_canonical` reads it, and
  `eq_of_modEq_of_lt` closes the gap: two values in `[0, N)` that agree mod `N` are equal.

`AirCrossRow`'s `PhaseIndicator` was FALSE of the descriptor for exactly one missing `% P`, and
`tr 0 (SEL 0) = 1 + P` refuted it. Every statement below is in the reading
`prove_vm_descriptor2` performs, from the start — including the ℤ one, which is reached THROUGH the
mod-`P` reading of 32 bodies each provably below `P` in absolute value, never around it.

## ⚑ WHY THE TWO MODULI DO NOT COLLIDE — the canonicality relay, and it is the load-bearing idea

A register limb is forced only mod `P`; the ALU speaks about `sVal` over ℤ. Naively these do not
compose, and the composition would need a range check on the register file that `programAir` does
not emit. It closes anyway, and the reason is structural:

* the routing gate forces `x_i ≡ REGᵣ_i [ZMOD P]`, and **`x_i` IS range-checked** (`limbCols X_BASE`
  is a declared `limbs` leg), so the register's residue is pinned to an 8-bit value AT EVERY READ;
* the register window forces `nxt(REGᵣ_i) ≡ z_i [ZMOD P]`, and **`z_i` IS range-checked**, so the
  residue written is an 8-bit value AT EVERY WRITE.

So `regVal` — the block read through `· % P` — is a well-defined field element on any satisfying
trace, `sVal (tr t) X_BASE = regVal (tr t) I.xr` **over ℤ** (`operand_x_is_the_register`), and the
mod-`N` chain runs. ⚑ Nothing in this file assumes a register column is canonical.

## ⚑ WHAT THE MANIFEST BUYS, AND WHY IT IS NOT AN ASSUMPTION ABOUT THE PROVER

`xRoute_forces_operand` takes `hsel : ∀ s < NREG, a (XSEL_BASE + s) = if s = r then 1 else 0` — an
**ℤ equality**, not a congruence. That is not a weakness and it is not assumed here: §6 DERIVES it
from the ROM lookup. `TableSem.exactPublicRows` makes the table the descriptor's own bytes, tuple
membership is list EQUALITY, and `romRow` emits `oneHot I.xr` — so the selector cells are pinned to
`0`/`1` over ℤ by the manifest, and no booleanity-plus-sum argument (which would only ever give a
congruence, and would rest on the prover's own selectors) is needed. The same route pins
`SEL_MUL`/`SEL_ADD`/`SEL_SUB` to the exact `= 1` the ALU forcing theorems want, and the 32 immediate
limbs to the descriptor's constants.

## ⚑ THE MODULUS-GENERAL FORM IS THE ONLY FORM

`programAir` is parametric in the limb vector `pl`; `MinaWrapVerifierSponge` §3 made the interpreter
parametric in the modulus and proved the Fp one is its instance by `rfl`. §8 is stated at
`(pl, N)` with `pl`'s two structural facts as hypotheses, and §9's two corollaries are it at
`(pLimb, pN)` and `(qLimb, qN)`. There is no second proof and no twin.

## ⚠ WHAT THIS DOES NOT CLOSE — §11 is the list, read it before quoting anything here

1. `RangeTablesHonest` is a **premise**, the same one `AirCrossRow`/`AirSelectorForcing` carry as
   `PoolsRanged`. It is the lookup argument's own meaning, one rail below any leg.
2. `Tracks` at row 0 is a **premise** — `programAir` pins no register column on the first row; a
   boundary does (`sboxPins`), and supplying it is that boundary's job.
3. The **last row's transition legs do not fire** (`AirLeg.forces` guards them on `isLast = false`),
   so the final instruction's write is forced only when a row follows it. Named
   `the_last_instruction_needs_a_row_after_it`.
4. `InstrOk` is a well-formedness condition on the PROGRAM — descriptor data, not prover data.

## Axiom hygiene

`#assert_axioms`-clean; no `sorry`/`admit`/`native_decide`; zero `#guard`s.
Nothing is emitted by name; no VK rotates; nothing re-emits; no fingerprint moves.

/-! ## §2 — ⚑ THE READING OF A ROW, AND WHAT A ROW IS TRACKING.

A `window` leg buys a congruence mod `P` and nothing else, so a register column's CONTENT is its
residue. `regVal` is that reading, and `Tracks` is the relation to the interpreter's register file
— mod the PASTA modulus, because that is the resolution the ALU's conclusion has. -/

/-- ⚑⚑ **THE FIELD ELEMENT A ROW'S REGISTER BLOCK PRESENTS.** `sVal` at `regCol r`, of the row read

never pins. -/
def regVal (a : Assignment) (r : Nat) : ℤ := sVal (canonRow a) (regCol r)

/-- ⚑⚑⚑ **THE TRACE'S REGISTER FILE IS THE INTERPRETER'S — OVER ℤ.**

⚠ **This was `Tracks (N : Nat) (a) (st) : ∀ r < NREG, regVal a r ≡ st r [ZMOD N]` until the
canonicity certificate landed, and the change is the point of that certificate.** An ℤ-equality
`Tracks` was FALSE of the descriptor while no leg was a less-than-the-modulus certificate on `z`:
`z`'s eight-bit limbs bought `sVal z < 2^256` against `pN ≈ 2^254.9`, so `r, r+p, … r+4p` all fit
with their own range-checked quotients, and `AirCrossRow.PhaseIndicator`'s first statement is the
precedent for what stating it anyway would have been. `MinaWrapVerifierProgram.zCanonLegs` is now a
leg of `programAir` and `z_is_canonical` is what it buys, so the equality is now a THEOREM.

⚑ **The modulus parameter is GONE, not defaulted.** An ℤ equality has no modulus to carry, and a
retained-but-unused `N` would let every stale `Tracks N …` call site keep elaborating against a
statement that no longer means what it did. Dropping the argument makes them REFUSE. -/

Three, and each is named rather than inlined so §11 can say exactly what is still standing. -/

/-- ⚑ **THE DECLARED RANGE TABLES CONTAIN ONLY WHAT THEY SAY.** The same premise `AirCrossRow`
carries as `PoolsRanged` and `AirSelectorForcing` names as the thing worth building once for the
whole cone: a `limbs` leg's `forces` is MEMBERSHIP in `tf`, and turning that into a numeric bound is
the lookup argument's own meaning, one rail below any leg. -/
def RangeTablesHonest (tf : TraceFamily) : Prop :=
  (∀ v : ℤ, [v] ∈ tf (rangeTidW SB) → 0 ≤ v ∧ v < 2 ^ SB)
  ∧ (∀ v : ℤ, [v] ∈ tf (rangeTidW CB) → 0 ≤ v ∧ v < 2 ^ CB)
  ∧ (∀ v : ℤ, [v] ∈ tf (rangeTidW CBITS) → 0 ≤ v ∧ v < 2)

/-- ⚑ **THE ROM TABLE IS THE DESCRIPTOR'S OWN BYTES.** `TableDef.publicContentsFaithful` at this
table, unfolded — the obligation `PublicTablesFaithful` imposes on every `exactPublicRows`
declaration and the deployed verifier enforces. -/
def RomFaithful (prog : List Instr) (tf : TraceFamily) : Prop :=
  tf ROM_TID = exactPublicTable (romRows prog)

/-- ⚑ **EVERY LEG OF THE MACHINE IS FORCED ON ROWS `0 … n−1`.** `isLast = false` on each of them,
which is what a `.transition` leg needs to fire — see §11.3 for the row that is left out. -/

    l.forces tf (rowEnv tr pub chal t) (t == 0) false

/-- ⚑ **WELL-FORMEDNESS OF AN INSTRUCTION** — a condition on DESCRIPTOR data, never on the witness.
⚠ `wr` is deliberately unconstrained: `romRow` emits `oneHot I.wr`, all-zero for `I.wr ≥ NREG`, and
`stepRegsAt` writes only when `I.wr < NREG`, so the two agree on "writes nothing" without a side
condition. `xr < NREG` is needed because an all-zero `XSEL` block has no register to route from
(and `xselSumExpr` would refuse the row); `yr ≤ NREG` because `NREG` is the immediate and anything
above it is a register the interpreter would read and the manifest would not name. -/

/-! ## §4 — ⚑ THE LEGS, BY MEMBERSHIP.

Each lemma exhibits ONE leg of `programAir pl prog` and reads its `forces` into the vocabulary the
per-row lemmas of `MinaWrapVerifierProgram` / `MinaWrapVerifierAir` consume: `P ∣ <body>`. ⚠ The
membership is against `(programAir pl prog).legs`, the list `lowerTiedAir` lowers — not against a

/-! ## §11 — ⚠ WHAT IS STILL STANDING.

1. **`RangeTablesHonest`** — the same premise `AirCrossRow.PoolsRanged` is, and for the same
   reason: a `limbs` leg's `forces` is MEMBERSHIP in the trace family, and the numeric bound is the
   LogUp argument's own meaning, one rail below any leg. It is not selector plumbing and it is not
   discharged here. ⚑ It is now stated ONCE for a whole descriptor's tables rather than per column
   pool, which is the `RangeTablesHonest tf → PoolsRanged tr` shape `AirSelectorForcing`'s header
   asked for; wiring `AirCrossRow` onto it is a separate, mechanical pass.

2. **The register file carries no range leg.** `programAir` range-checks `x`, `y`, `z`, the
   quotient, the two carry pools and now the certificate's two blocks — and NOT `regCol r + i`.
   This file does not need it (the header's canonicality relay), but the fact is worth stating on
   its own: the ONLY thing forced about a register column is its residue mod `P`, and any future
   consumer that reads `sVal (tr t) (regCol r)` instead of `regVal (tr t) r` is reading integers the
   descriptor does not pin. ⚠ `register_column_is_not_ranged` now carries `r < NREG` and `i < SK`
   and is stated over `machineRangedCols`; without those hypotheses it is FALSE, because
   `regCol 7 + 21 = 471` lands inside the certificate's complement block.

3. **The last row's transition legs do not fire.** `transition_legs_are_vacuous_on_the_last_row` is
   that as a theorem. So `rows_track_the_interpreter` covers instructions `0 … n−1` where the trace
   has a row `n`; the deployed traces reach a power-of-two height by padding
   (`MinaWrapVerifierProgram.padInstr`), so the instruction whose result is read is never the last
   row — but a caller who forgets that is reading an unforced write.

4. **`Tracks` at row 0 is a premise.** `programAir` pins no register column on the first row; a
   boundary does (`sboxPins` and its siblings), and `programAir_boundary_pinsTied` is what makes
   adding one cost a single structural lemma.

5. ✅ **CLOSED 2026-08-10 — THE MOD-`N` CEILING IS GONE, AND WHAT REPLACED IT COST 63 COLUMNS.**
   This entry read *"the mod-`N` resolution is a CEILING, not a choice — UNDONE WORK, not a theorem
   of the model"*, and it was right: no leg was a less-than-the-modulus certificate on `z`, the
   limb ranges bought only `sVal z < 2^256` against `pN ≈ 2^254.9`, and `r, r+p, r+2p, r+3p, r+4p`
   all fit with their own range-checked quotients. `programAir` now carries
   `MinaWrapVerifierProgram.zCanonLegs`; `z_is_canonical` reads it; `Tracks` is an ℤ EQUALITY.

   ⚑⚑ **What did NOT transfer is the fix SHAPE, and the reason is the whole lesson.** This entry
   named `PastaMsmScalarDerive` §2.7's certificate — `s + Σ_{p<255} 2^p·CBc p = q − 1` over 255
   boolean columns — and priced it at `+255` columns / `+256` constraints. That shape is correct in
   the model §2.7 is stated in (`PastaField.acceptB`, the ℤ reading of the emitted bodies) and
   **cannot force anything in the model THIS file is stated in.** One gate whose integer body is
   ~`2^256`, read as `P ∣ body` with `P ≈ 2^31`, leaves `2^225` satisfying assignments. Porting it
   verbatim would have restated `AirCrossRow.PhaseIndicator`'s first statement one layer up: an ℤ
   claim over legs that buy a congruence, of which no proof could have existed.

   The shape that survives the mod-`P` reading is the one add/sub already uses — a LIMB-WISE
   identity with a carry chain, every body bounded below `P` so `P ∣ body` forces `body = 0` over
   ℤ, and 32 identities that telescope. `PastaAddSubSound` §4b is it: `z + c + 1 = N` over `SK = 32`
   complement limbs and `NA − 1 = 31` carries.

   ⚑ **RE-DERIVED PRICE, not inherited: `+63` columns and `+32` gate legs (plus 2 `limbs` legs),
   against §2.7's `+255` / `+256`.** Four times cheaper AND forcing where §2.7's is not — the bit
   decomposition spends 255 columns saying "non-negative"; a range-checked byte block says it in 32.

   ⚠ **What this does NOT close, stated so it is not read as more:** `cnHonest_satisfies_gates` is a
   KAT at three values, not the general completeness theorem (*for every `zv < N` the honest carry
   chain's divisions are exact*), which is the `limbs_recompose` truncation argument and is UNDONE.
   Soundness — the direction `Tracks` at ℤ depends on — is fully general.

6. **Everything below this file's floor is untouched** — the ℤ↔felt reading (K1), the FRI/STARK
   floor, and `MinaWrapClosingAir` residuals (a) and (c). This closes (b) and nothing else. -/

/-- ⚑⚑ **A `.transition` LEG CLAIMS NOTHING ON THE LAST ROW** — for EVERY body and every trace
family, so this is the shape of the boundary and not an artefact of the machine. It is why
`RowsForced` is quantified over `t < n` and why the write of instruction `n−1` needs a row `n`. -/

the same price `sboxTiedAir` pays for `pinsTied`.

⚠ **RENAMED from `aluRangedCols_are_the_limbs_legs_cols`, whose NAME STOPPED BEING TRUE.** The
machine now range-checks 63 columns that are not ALU columns — the certificate's complement block
and its carry chain — so the flattened `limbs`-leg column list is no longer `aluRangedCols`. Keeping
the old name over the new list would have been the quietest possible lie in this file. -/

theorem certRangedCols_above_the_certificate_base : ∀ c ∈ certRangedCols, ZCAN_BASE ≤ c := by

/-- ⚑⚑ **AND NO REGISTER COLUMN IS ONE.** The register file sits strictly between the ALU row and
the certificate block — `226 ≤ regCol r + i < 469` for `r < NREG`, `i < SK` — so it is in no
declared range table, which is why §2's `regVal` reads the register block through `· % P` and never
as an integer.

⚠ **The hypotheses `r < NREG` and `i < SK` are NEW and they are not decoration.** The old statement
quantified over ALL `r` and `i` and was true only because every ranged column was below
`ALU_WIDTH`; the certificate's blocks live at `469..531`, and `regCol 7 + 21 = 471` is inside them.
So the unhypothesised form is now FALSE, and stating it would have been the second-quietest lie. -/
