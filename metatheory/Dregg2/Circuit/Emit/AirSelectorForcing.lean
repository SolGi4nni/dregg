# `Dregg2.Circuit.Emit.AirSelectorForcing` — ⚑⚑⚑ THE TWO SELECTOR PREMISES, DISCHARGED.

## ⚑ SAY THE SUBSTRATE OUT LOUD

**This is Lean-authored AIR.** Nothing here is a Rust gate, a Rust builder, or a Rust
`air_accepts`. Every leg cashed below is a member of `PastaCurveScheduled.pallasScheduledAir.legs`
— the list the emit lowers — reached by list membership, never re-typed. House Law #1.

## ⚑ WHAT THIS CLOSES

`AirCrossRow` §6 proved that the SCHEDULED trace forces the RCB formula **conditional on two
premises**, and both were named as selector plumbing rather than theorems of the model:

> `PhaseIndicator` (row `t` reads phase `i` as `[i = t]`) and `RowsSat` (row `i` satisfies op `i`'s
> core gates). Until they land, quote §6 as FORCING CONDITIONAL ON THE SELECTOR READING HONESTLY.

Both are theorems here, from the emitted block's own legs:

* `phaseIndicator_of_selectorLegs` — from `selBooleanLegs` + `selOneHotLeg` + `selShiftLegs`.
* `rowsSat_of_scheduleLegs` — from `scheduleLegs`, whose every gate is `gateBy (SEL i)` of a core
  gate, at the row where `PhaseIndicator` says the selector reads `1`.

and `pallasScheduledBlock_forces_the_rcb_formula` / `vestaScheduledBlock_forces_the_rcb_formula`
are §6 **with no selector premise left**. ⚠ Quote them, not the conditional form.

## ⚑⚑ THE PREMISE WAS NOT MERELY UNDONE — ITS OLD STATEMENT WAS FALSE OF THE DESCRIPTOR

`AirCrossRow.PhaseIndicator` read, until 2026-08-08:

    ∀ t < 33, ∀ i < 34, tr t (SEL i) = if i = t then 1 else 0        -- over ℤ

**No leg can force that.** `AirLeg.forces` on a `window` is `body ≡ 0 [ZMOD PMOD]`, so a trace with
`tr 0 (SEL 0) = 1 + P` satisfies booleanity, the one-hot sum and every shift leg, and refutes the
ℤ-equality. The premise was not a target waiting for a proof; it was a statement about a **different
object** than the one the descriptor constrains, and the honest fix is to restate it mod `P` — which
is what `AirCrossRow` now does, and which pulled `indicator_sum_modEq`, `carryMask_is_one` and
`carried_of_carryLeg` into the same reading. ⚑ **Nothing is relaxed by that**: the congruence is the
reading `prove_vm_descriptor2` performs, and every other lemma in the cone was already in it.

## ⚑ WHERE THE PRIME FIELD ACTUALLY ENTERS, AND IT IS ONE PLACE

The shift half of the register is a plain induction and needs no field theory: `nxt(sᵢ₊₁) = loc(sᵢ)`
walks the indicator forward, `nxt(s₀) = 0` kills the return, and the idle leg absorbs phase 32. The
step that needs an argument is **row 0**: `sᵢ ≡ 0` for `i ≥ 1`, which is booleanity plus sum-to-one.

* `bit_of_boolean` — `x·(x−1) ≡ 0 [ZMOD P]` ⇒ `x ≡ 0 ∨ x ≡ 1`. This is exactly `Prime (P : ℤ)`; over
  a composite modulus it is FALSE and a prover would have a third residue to sit on.
* `bits_sum_is_a_count` — a list of bits sums to a NATURAL NUMBER `n ≤ length`, mod `P`.
* `bits_onehot` — with `length < P` and one entry reading `1`, every other entry reads `0`. The
  `length < P` side condition is not decoration: it is what turns `n ≡ 0 [ZMOD P]` into `n = 0`, and
  a register with `P` or more phases would satisfy the sum with every phase live.

⚠ **`SEL` IS THE IDENTITY ON COLUMN INDICES** (`PastaCurveScheduled.SEL i = i`), so "phase column
`i`" and "column `i`" are the same object; the statements below are written at `tr t i` and the two
readings coincide by `rfl`. That is a property of THIS layout, not a convention.

## ⚠ WHICH OBJECT EACH THEOREM IS ABOUT — this cone has two schedules with similar names

Everything here is about **`AirColumnAlloc.rcbOpsScheduled`**, the emitted hand schedule, through
`PastaCurveScheduled.rcbSchedule` (`rcbSchedule_is_the_scheduled_dag` pins the two equal). ⚠ It is
**NOT** about `AirSchedule.rcbOpsOptimal`: `1 307` is a width result no forcing theorem mentions,
and moving to the optimal schedule would move `rcbSchedule`, `carryPhases`, `loOf`/`hiOf` and every
`by decide` in `AirCrossRow` §5b with it.

## ⚠ WHAT IS STILL A PREMISE, AND IT IS A DIFFERENT KIND

`AirCrossRow.PoolsRanged` — that the values the trace presents really are byte/16-bit/1-bit ranged.
§5 below still takes it, exactly as `AirCrossRow` §6 did and exactly as the 3 048-column one-row
block does. ⚠ It is **not** selector plumbing and it is **not** discharged here: `valuePoolLegs` and
`witnessPoolLegs` put every pooled column in a declared range table on every row, but turning that
into a numeric bound needs *"the table the family supplies for `rangeTidW 8` contains only
byte-valued singletons"* — a statement about the TRACE FAMILY the lookup argument produces, one rail
below any leg. That is the lookup argument's own meaning, it is the SAME floor the one-row block
stands on, and it is UNDONE WORK rather than a theorem of the model: the thing worth building is a
`RangeTablesHonest tf → PoolsRanged tr` lemma serving every descriptor in this cone, not one.

⚑ **Nothing about the scheduled layout weakens it.** The pooled legs assert on all 64 rows what the
one-row block asserted once (`PastaCurveScheduled` §3b), so the hypotheses the forcing lemmas take
are strictly more available here, not less.

## Axiom hygiene

`#assert_axioms`-clean; no `sorry`/`admit`/`native_decide`; zero `#guard`s.
Nothing is emitted by name; no VK rotates; nothing re-emits.

/-! ## §2 — ⚑ THE HYPOTHESIS: THE EMITTED BLOCK'S LEGS, FORCED ON THE 33 OP ROWS.

One predicate, over a leg LIST rather than an AIR, so the extraction is list membership and the
pallas/vesta split is one `rfl` rather than two proofs.

⚑ **The flags are the real ones, not `false false`.** Row 0 carries `isFirst`; and no row `t < 33`
is the LAST row of the block, because `prove_vm_descriptor2` refuses a non-power-of-two trace height
(`descriptor_ir2.rs:6987`) so the 33 op rows sit inside 64 with the idle phase absorbing the tail.
A `.first` leg that never fired would leave the register unpinned at row 0 and `PhaseIndicator`
unprovable, so the flag is where the argument lives. -/

/-! ## §4 — ⚑⚑⚑ `RowsSat` IS A THEOREM.

`opLegs pl i t` is `((coreOf pl t.1).legs … |>.filter isGate).map (gateBy (SEL i))`, so a core gate's
phase-gated image is one `List.mem_map` / `List.mem_filter` / `List.mem_append_left` away from the
emitted list. With the selector reading `1` at row `i`, the gate is the core gate. -/

/-- ⚑⚑ **A PHASE-GATED GATE, CASHED ON ITS OWN ROW.** `gateBy (SEL i)` multiplies the body by the
selector; at row `i` the selector is congruent to `1`, so the body vanishes on its own.

⚠ This is where a prover would attack a schedule that only had booleanity: with `sᵢ` free to be `0`
at row `i`, EVERY gate would be satisfiable by turning the phase off. `sel_onehot` plus the shift is
what makes `sᵢ ≡ 1` at row `i` rather than merely `sᵢ ∈ {0,1}`. -/
