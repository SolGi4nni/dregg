⚠⚠⚠ THE WELD IS ON THE WIRE ONLY — THE DESCRIPTOR STILL *COMMITS* ~31 BITS. Read this before citing
anything below as a deployed width fix. (An adversarial verify made this the primary finding; this
file's own §3a framing was stronger than the truth, and `weld_completion_lanes_free` below already
proved the truth.)

WHAT IS REAL: the descriptor now CARRIES eight root columns (W8ROOT 0..7 = cols 3..10), pinned to
eight public inputs on row 0 and threaded by eight constancy windows — verified on the emitted JSON
(`"root":[var 3, var 4, …, var 10]` vs the unwelded `[var 3 ×8]`). The binding theorem
`root8_binds_automaton_or_collides` is re-proven over `mapRoot8`/`opensToMerkle8` and consumes NO
`Poseidon2SpongeCR` — the hypothesis BabyBear refutes is gone from the binding leg — with
`weld_collision_disjunct_refutable` showing the collision disjunct is REFUTABLE (not a pigeonhole
free pass).

WHAT IS NOT REAL YET, and it is the load-bearing half: `DescriptorIR2.MapOp.holdsAt` reads
`(m.root 0)` and `MapOp.rowAt` logs `(m.root 0)` — LANE 0 ONLY, whatever the group carries
(DescriptorIR2.lean:580-584). So the per-row OPENING the IR actually forces is still the ~31-bit
scalar `opensTo hash (lane 0)`, and lanes 1-7 are pinned and threaded but CONTENT-UNFORCED.
`weld_completion_lanes_free` EXHIBITS this rather than asserting it: the very same descriptor is
satisfied with the seven completion lanes set to two DIFFERENT felt vectors.

⇒ HONEST STATUS: the wire is welded, the DENOTATION is not. An attacker still only has to collide the
lane-0 felt (~2^15.5), so the automaton binding is NOT yet a deployed security property. The weld is
necessary but not sufficient.

⚠ AND THE SECOND, INDEPENDENT SCOPE LIMIT — the one removing a false floor does NOT touch: NOTHING
SHIPPED EMITS THIS DESCRIPTOR. Asked directly, because the sibling `CommittedRowsSemantics` carries a
limit of this shape and records it at the top: is `weldDesc`/`autoRoot8` a SHADOW? Answered in both
directions, because they differ.

  * `autoRoot8` is NOT a shadow. It is `MapMerkleRoot.mapRoot8` at a `Heap8Scheme`, and
    `DeployedHeapTree.deployedHeap8Scheme` is a CONSTRUCTED inhabitant of that class — the object
    `heap_root.rs::CanonicalHeapTree8::root` computes. §2 quantifies over `∀ S8 : Heap8Scheme`, so it
    is a theorem about the real deployed hash tree, not a modelled stand-in.
  * `weldDesc` is NOT a shadow declaration either — unlike `CommittedRowsSemantics.committedRows`,
    which is not a `RowSemantics` constructor at all and can only ride one, `weldDesc` is a real
    `EffectVmDescriptor2` over real `VmConstraint2` constructors, and §5 EMITS it (`emitVmJson2`).
  * ⚠ BUT IT IS UNROUTED. `WELD_NAME` ("dregg-attested-automaton::map-committed-weld8-v1") has NO
    entry in `EmitByName.routing`, NO `circuit/descriptors/by-name/*.json` artifact, and NO arm in
    `circuit/src/descriptor_by_name.rs`. Neither does the unwelded `AttestedAutomatonEmit`
    `attestedInstance`: the whole attested-automaton family is Lean-side only today. So no shipped
    prover or verifier ever builds this object, and §2's binding is a theorem about a deployed hash
    tree that NO SHIPPED DESCRIPTOR CURRENTLY OPENS.

⇒ so a floor-free theorem here is not yet a deployed one for TWO separate reasons, and they have two
separate repairs: the denotation move below (`DescriptorIR2`, shared, in flight), and a routing entry
plus a Rust dispatch arm (mechanical, not started). The denotation half is the hard one; neither is
done, and neither is claimed.

THE REMAINING FIX, named precisely: move `MapOp.holdsAt`/`MapOp.rowAt` off `(m.root 0)` onto
`opensToMerkle8`/`writesToMerkle8` so the denotation forces all eight lanes. That edit touches
`DescriptorIR2` and therefore every MapOp consumer in the tree — a genuine red-umbrella change.

⚑ DO NOT DUPLICATE IT: that work is ALREADY IN FLIGHT in this tree by another terminal —
`Dregg2/Circuit/MapKindImtGates.lean` ("STAGE 2 PROPER OF THE DENOTATION MOVE") is building
`MapOp.holdsAtS` with `writesToMerkleS`/`opensToMerkleS` arms, having already done the `.absent` arm
in `MapAbsentImtGate`. When that lands, THIS file's binding becomes a deployed property for free:
`root8_binds_automaton_or_collides` is already stated over `mapRoot8`/`opensToMerkle8`, so it needs no
change — only the IR's denotation has to start forcing what the wire already carries. The right move
here is to WAIT for that landing and then re-run `weld_completion_lanes_free`, which must FLIP from
provable to refutable. That flip is the acceptance test.
# Dregg2.Circuit.Emit.AttestedAutomatonWeld8 — the ATTESTATION ROOT, WELDED TO 8 FELTS.

**This is Lean-authored AIR.** The descriptor is an `EffectVmDescriptor2` authored here; the witness
is a concrete `VmTrace`; satisfaction, the binding and the refusal are theorems over the EMITTED
object. Rust parses the emitted IR2 bytes and supplies witnesses; it authors nothing.

## What this repairs

`AttestedAutomatonEmit` binds "which automaton ran" by a `MapOp` opening against ONE root column
(`ROOT = 3`), fed into all eight deployed lanes as `EffectVmEmitRotationV3.scalarRootGroup ROOT`.
Its own header states the wound at full resolution: the deployed instantiation has a BabyBear
codomain (`p ≈ 2^31`), so `Poseidon2SpongeCR hash` — the hypothesis `root_binds_automaton` consumes
— is FALSE there, and a ~2^15.5 birthday search finds a colliding automaton. The binding was a Lean
theorem about a modelled `hash : List ℤ → ℤ`, not a deployed security property.

This file carries the root as EIGHT columns, mirroring `beforeCapRootGroup`/`beforeHeapRootGroup`
(`fun i => .var (groupCol i)`, lane 0 the scalar limb, lanes 1..7 the completion limbs), and
re-proves the binding over the DEPLOYED 8-felt tree (`MapMerkleRoot.mapRoot8` / `opensToMerkle8` —
`node8`, arity-16 chip absorbs, the object `heap_root.rs` computes), where the committed digest is
8 BabyBear felts (~248 bits, birthday ~2^124) rather than one (~31 bits, birthday ~2^15.5).

## The three legs, and the one that does NOT weld in this IR

  * **§1–§2, the COMMITMENT and the BINDING — WELDED.** `autoRoot8 S8 d` is the deployed
    `node8` root of the automaton's `2^16`-leaf heap; `autoRoot8_commits` CONSTRUCTS it (the
    predicate is inhabited, not a wish). `root8_binds_automaton_or_collides` is UNCONDITIONAL: two
    automata behind ONE 8-felt root agree on the whole declared domain, OR the deployed arity-16
    chip genuinely collides at the pair a TOTAL extractor names (`MapRootColl`). `forged_edge_
    refused_8` is the same statement at the forgery polarity. NO `Poseidon2SpongeCR` is consumed.
  * **§3, the DESCRIPTOR — WELDED ON THE WIRE.** `weldDesc` carries the 8 lanes as the `MapOp`
    root/newRoot GROUP (the real `Fin 8 → EmittedExpr` shape the deployed `MapOpSpec.root` and the
    19-felt map-log tuple `[root8, key, value, op, new_root8]` want:
    `circuit/src/descriptor_ir2.rs:2165-2185`), pins all EIGHT lanes to public inputs on the first
    row, and threads all EIGHT by constancy windows. `weldWit_satisfies` is a real
    `Satisfied2Public` witness for it (⚑ the standing gate: no cost is quoted below without one).
  * **⚠ §3a, the LEG THAT CANNOT WELD HERE, NAMED PRECISELY.** `DescriptorIR2.MapOp.holdsAt` reads
    `(m.root 0)` — LANE 0 ONLY — and `MapOp.rowAt` logs lane 0 only (a 5-felt model row against the
    deployed 19). So the per-row OPENING the IR forces is the ~31-bit scalar `opensTo hash (lane 0)`
    no matter how many lanes the group carries, and the seven completion lanes are pinned and
    threaded but their CONTENT is unforced. `weld_completion_lanes_free` PROVES that: the very same
    descriptor is satisfied with the completion lanes set to ANY felts whatsoever. This is not a
    surprise and not a defect of this file — it is the same status `EffectVmEmitRotationV3` records
    for cap/heap ("the full 8-felt faithfulness is trace-forced by the after-spine keystone
    (`CapOpenEmit`/`HeapOpenEmit`)"), and `MapMerkleRoot` §5b names the fix exactly: "`MapOp.holdsAt`'s
    deployed denotation moves onto `opensToMerkle8`/`writesToMerkle8`". That edit is to
    `DescriptorIR2`, a SHARED file, and is NOT made here.

So, stated at the resolution the objects support: the attestation's COMMITMENT and BINDING are now
8-felt and carry no BabyBear-refuted hypothesis; the descriptor's WIRE is 8-felt; the descriptor's
per-row DENOTATION is still lane-0 scalar, and that is a named IR gap with a named fix, not a claim.

## Axiom hygiene

`#assert_all_clean` ⊆ {propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound} on every theorem (§6). NEW file;
imports read-only; `Dregg2.lean` untouched. Every `#guard` in §5 is COMPILED EVALUATION of a closed
`Bool` — it proves NO `Prop`; it pins measured numbers and nothing more.

/-- **(CANARY — the collision disjunct is REFUTABLE, so §2 is not a free pass.)** Exhibiting the
named-pair disjunct REFUTES the deployed chip's injectivity outright, so nobody discharges §2 by
taking the right branch: the binding half has to do all the work.

⚑ STATED AS ANTI-FLOOR CONTENT, not as a bridge under a `Compress8CR` binder. The two spellings
are definitionally equal (`Γ, F ⊢ False` IS `Γ ⊢ ¬ F`), but the binder spelling makes the canary a
CARRIER of a hypothesis this tree PROVES FALSE at deployed BabyBear parameters
(`VacuitySweepTeeth.deployedHeap8Scheme_chip_not_Compress8CR`) — a theorem the accrual gate must
then grandfather as knowingly vacuous. This spelling assumes no floor, so it is exempt by
construction, and it says strictly MORE: not "at an injective chip the disjunct is empty" but "the
disjunct IS a chip collision".

⚑ **AND IT IS THE ONLY BRIDGE THIS FILE NEEDS — `root8_binds_automaton_of_injective` IS DELETED
(2026-07-25).** That theorem used to sit immediately below: "given `hCR : Compress8CR
S8.chipAbsorb8`, two automata committed by ONE 8-felt root agree on the whole declared domain",
i.e. the injective special case of the line above. It was never a second result. Its type is
inhabited by `Or.resolve_right` over the two theorems that flanked it, in ONE constructive term,
at the same implicit heaps and with no other input:

    Or.resolve_right (root8_binds_automaton_or_collides S8 R8 d e hd he)
                     (fun hc => weld_collision_disjunct_refutable S8 _ _ hc hCR)

So the strength relation is still EXHIBITED, by the pair (`root8_binds_automaton_or_collides`,
this canary), and both halves are floor-free. What the bridge added was the carrier: `Compress8CR`
in binder position, a hypothesis `VacuitySweepTeeth.compress8CR_false_babyBear` PROVES FALSE at
deployed BabyBear parameters and `deployedHeap8Scheme_chip_not_Compress8CR` refutes at the very
scheme it ranged over. It was vacuously true at deployment, it had NO consumer anywhere in the
tree, and keeping it meant recording a knowingly-vacuous theorem in `FloorRatchetBaseline`.

⚑ AND IT IS NOT THE GRANDFATHERED-SIBLING CASE. `DeployedCapTree` §5.1 already settled this exact
question, in prose, before this file existed: *"Deliberately NOT restated as … per-theorem
`…_of_injective` bridges. Each such restatement would be a NEW declaration taking a hypothesis this
tree PROVES FALSE at deployed BabyBear parameters — i.e. a new VACUOUS declaration, which is the
accrual `#floor_ratchet` exists to stop. The 8-felt sibling's `…8_injective_of_injective` family
predates the gate and is grandfathered; this one does not get to add to that pile … One bridge,
used."* The baselined siblings are that grandfathered pile — the six on
`DeployedCapTree.Cap8Scheme` and the four in `MapMerkleRoot` §5b.S. Each one that is spelled
"NO STRENGTH LOST" recovers a NAMED STATEMENT THAT WAS DELETED (`capLeafDigest8_injective`,
`nodeOf8_injective`, `recomposeUp8_inj_of_path`, `mapRoot8_injective`, the existential-level
`opensToMerkle8_functional`, `writesToMerkle8_functional`), so grandfathering it records that a
specific removal cost nothing; the remaining `…Coll_refutable_of_injective` ones are the canary in
the pre-2026-07-25 CARRIER spelling — exactly the content this one now states floor-free. This
bridge is in neither class. It recovered nothing: `root8_binds_automaton_or_collides` was born
unconditional in the SAME commit that introduced the bridge (`915437862f`), and the 1-felt original
it was the analog of (`AttestedAutomatonEmit.root_binds_automaton`) is still in the tree and still
baselined. Deleting is therefore unadditive bookkeeping, not a judgement call. -/

/-! ### §3a — ⚠ THE LEG THAT DOES NOT WELD IN THIS IR, EXHIBITED.

`DescriptorIR2.MapOp.holdsAt` reads `(m.root 0)` and `MapOp.rowAt` logs `(m.root 0)`: the per-row
denotation is LANE 0, whatever the group carries. So the descriptor CANNOT force the seven
completion lanes, and the theorem below exhibits it rather than asserting it — the same witness, the
same descriptor, ANY completion lanes. (This is the exact status `EffectVmEmitRotationV3` records
for cap/heap: the 8-felt faithfulness is trace-forced by the after-spine keystone, not by the
`MapOp`. The IR fix `MapMerkleRoot` §5b names — moving `MapOp.holdsAt` onto `opensToMerkle8` — is a
`DescriptorIR2` edit, not made here.) -/

/-- ⚠ **THE COMPLETION LANES ARE FREE.** For ANY two assignments of lanes 1..7 the welded descriptor
is satisfied by the corresponding witness. The 8-felt weld is real ON THE WIRE (8 columns, 8 public
pins, 8 constancy windows) and NOT YET content-forcing IN THE DENOTATION. -/

/-! ## §5 — ⚑ THE MEASURED PRICE OF THE WELD.

⚠ Every `#guard` below is COMPILED EVALUATION of a closed `Bool` — it proves NO `Prop`. The
`Prop`-level content is §2 (the welded binding and refusal) and §3.W (the witness).

⚠ Both descriptors measured here are SATISFIABLE: `weldDesc` by `weldWit_satisfies_constructed`,
the run-table baseline by `TinyAutomataSatisfiable.prodRunWit_satisfies`, the unwelded attested
object by `AttestedAutomatonEmit.attWit_satisfies`. Nothing without a witness is priced. -/

-- ⚑ THE WELDED SHAPE: 11 columns (3 + the 8 root lanes), 10 PIs (2 + the 8 root lanes), 20
-- constraints (1 open + 1 continuity + 2 pi bindings + 8 lane windows + 8 lane pins), ONE table,
-- ZERO declared rows, ZERO nonlinear multiplications.
#guard costOf weldInstance ==
  { traceWidth := 11, piCount := 10, constraints := 20, tables := 1
  , declaredRows := 0, forcedTraceRows := 0, nonlinearMults := 0 }

-- … against the UNWELDED attested object (4 / 3 / 6). The weld costs +7 columns, +7 PIs, +14
-- constraints; it adds NO table, NO declared row and NO nonlinear multiplication.
#guard costOf attestedInstance ==
  { traceWidth := 4, piCount := 3, constraints := 6, tables := 1
  , declaredRows := 0, forcedTraceRows := 0, nonlinearMults := 0 }

-- ⚑ WIRE BYTES, pinned: 2596 welded vs 1190 unwelded — 2.18× (+1406 bytes), CONSTANT in `|w|` and
-- in `|Q|·|Σ|` exactly as before (ONE object for every automaton and every word length).
#guard (jsonBytes weldInstance, jsonBytes attestedInstance) == (2596, 1190)

-- ⚑ THE RESTATED CROSSOVER. The run-table descriptor at k = 4 grows ~10 bytes per symbol because it
-- SHIPS THE RUN. The UNWELDED attested object ties it at |w| = 60 and is smaller from 61 on; the
-- WELDED object is still larger at |w| = 200 (2589 < 2596) and is strictly smaller from |w| = 201
-- on (2599 > 2596). The weld moves the byte crossover 60 → 201.
#guard (List.map (fun n => jsonBytes (prodRunDesc 4 (wordN n))) [60, 61, 128, 199, 200, 201, 202])
  == [1190, 1199, 1869, 2579, 2589, 2599, 2609]

-- At the FIXED 8-symbol probe word the run-table descriptor is far smaller (654–670 vs 2596) — but
-- it is a DIFFERENT object per k AND per word, and it binds no automaton at any width.
#guard (List.map (fun k => jsonBytes (prodRunDesc k probeW)) [1, 2, 3, 4]) == [654, 654, 665, 670]

-- ⚑ MAIN-TRACE AREA (columns × trace rows): welded 11·|w| vs unwelded 4·|w| vs the unbound run
-- table's 3·|w|. The weld's whole main-trace price is the 7 completion-lane columns.
#guard (List.map (fun n => (WELD_WIDTH * n, 4 * n, 3 * n)) [8, 16, 32])
  == [(88, 32, 24), (176, 64, 48), (352, 128, 96)]

-- ⚑ THE AUX BILL — UNCHANGED IN ROWS. One map-ops row per opened trace row (5·|w| in the model)
-- and `MAP_TREE_DEPTH` chip permutations per opened row (16·|w|) both hold before and after the
-- weld: the weld buys WIDTH, not rows. What widens is the tuple — the model logs arity 5 while the
-- DEPLOYED map-log tuple is 19 felts `[root8, key, value, op, new_root8]`
-- (`circuit/src/descriptor_ir2.rs:2165-2185`), and the deployed node absorb is the arity-16 `node8`.
#guard (List.map (fun n => (5 * n, 19 * n, MAP_TREE_DEPTH * n)) [8, 16, 32])
  == [(40, 152, 128), (80, 304, 256), (160, 608, 512)]

-- ⚑ THE WELD, EXHIBITED ON THE WIRE. The emitted `MapOpSpec.root` lane list of the welded
-- descriptor is EIGHT DISTINCT COLUMNS (3..10); the unwelded object emits column 3 EIGHT TIMES
-- (`scalarRootGroup ROOT`). This is the byte-level difference the deployed chip reads.

/-! ### The law, restated for the WELDED shape

At word length `|w|`, over descriptors that HAVE WITNESSES:

  * **run table, UNBOUND** (`TinyAutomataSatisfiable.prodRunWit_satisfies`) — 3 cols, 4 constraints,
    2 PIs, `|w|` declared rows, main area `3·|w|`, no aux chip rows, bytes GROWING ~10 per symbol.
  * **attested, BOUND AT ~31 BITS** (`AttestedAutomatonEmit.attWit_satisfies`) — 4 cols, 6
    constraints, 3 PIs, main area `4·|w|`, `5·|w|` map-op rows, `16·|w|` chip rows, 1190 bytes flat,
    byte crossover at `|w| = 60`. Its binding consumes `Poseidon2SpongeCR` at a BabyBear codomain,
    where it is FALSE (~2^15.5 birthday).
  * **attested, WELDED TO 8 FELTS** (`weldWit_satisfies_constructed`) — 11 cols, 20 constraints, 10
    PIs, main area `11·|w|`, the SAME `5·|w|` map-op rows and `16·|w|` chip rows, 2596 bytes flat,
    byte crossover at `|w| = 201`. Its binding (`root8_binds_automaton_or_collides`) consumes NO
    crypto hypothesis: an equivocating prover must exhibit the collision a TOTAL extractor names at
    the deployed arity-16 chip, whose output is 8 BabyBear felts (~248 bits; the felt-width
    campaign's birthday arithmetic puts that at ~2^124, against ~2^15.5 for one felt — that is the
    campaign's arithmetic, cited, not a measurement made here).

⚠ HONEST, since it was asked directly: welding does NOT raise the aux bill. The map-op row count and
the Merkle-path chip-row count are identical before and after (`5·|w|` and `16·|w|`); no chip
permutation and no table is added. The price is paid entirely in the main trace and the wire — +7
columns (2.75× main area), +14 constraints, +7 public inputs, +1406 wire bytes (2.18×) — and in the
byte crossover moving 60 → 201. For a security boundary that is a cheap trade, and it is measured.

⚠ AND, equally honest: those numbers price the WIRE weld. The DENOTATION weld is not in them,
because it is not in this IR (§3a) — `MapOp.holdsAt` reads lane 0. Whatever the eventual
`opensToMerkle8` denotation costs the deployed chip (the arity-16 `node8` absorb is materially more
expensive per permutation than an arity-2 one) is NOT counted above and is NOT claimed here. -/
