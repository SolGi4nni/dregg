# AutomataflBraidFold — M7 of the multi-round conflict braid: THE `runTurn` FOLD

⚑ SUBSTRATE. This file authors **no AIR, no gadget, no constraint**. It is the SPEC-side fold
(`AutomataflRules.roundStep` / `runTurn`) that COMPOSES the already-proven Lean-authored-AIR
refinements: M2 (`legC_sat_imp_roundAgainN11`, a satisfying Leg C trace = one `.again` round) and
M6 (`turn_sat_imp_roundStepMarks_pi`, the clean round consuming the accumulated `RoundState`). The
Leg C / Leg R / Leg A descriptors live under `Dregg2.Circuit.Emit.Automatafl*` and are unchanged;
nothing here is Rust.

## What M7 proves

`braid_sat_imp_runTurn` (n = 11, P = 2): given a TRACE of rounds —

* `k` conflict rounds, each a satisfying Leg C trace whose decoded `RoundState` windows chain
  (`roundStateDecodeOut (tᵢ) RoundStateAgrees roundStateDecodeIn (tᵢ₊₁)`, the fold seam), and
* a clean round whose satisfying resolve-marks + step traces have `marksIn` agreeing with the last
  conflict round's `marksOut` (the C→R handoff) —

the decoded final board IS `(runTurn ⟨.column⟩ g (openRound b₀ seats) subsTrace)`'s board, cell for
cell at n = 11.

## The two technical seams

1. **The RoundState / `Perm` thread.** The fold seam is `RoundStateAgrees` (§ M1 proved literal `=`
   FALSE — the marks list's insertion order is not recoverable from an n² indicator). `roundStep`
   is `RoundStateAgrees`-CONGRUENT: `MoveLegal` reads `marks` only through `∉` (`Perm`-invariant),
   `RoundWF` only through `Nodup`, and every board read is through `cellAt` / `size` / `automaton`,
   so cell-agreeing boards + `Perm`-marks produce the same clash set (as LISTS), the same locked /
   waiting fields (EQUAL), `Perm`-marks on the re-entry state, and cell-agreeing resolved boards.
   `roundStep_agree` is that congruence; the fold threads it.

2. **Termination.** `AutomataflTermination.againDepth_le` bounds the conflict rounds by n² (121 at
   n = 11); `runTurn` is TOTAL on any trace and returns `none` only when the trace runs out. This
   file carries the trace as an explicit hypothesis (the prover supplies the k conflict subs plus
   the clean subs); the n² bound tells the host a trace of length n² + 1 always suffices, so no fuel
   hypothesis is smuggled into the theorem.

## Scope, said out loud

P = 2 (`LEGC_SEATS = 2`): a pair clash re-enters BOTH seats, so the clean round's moves are both
fresh and `locked = []`. The only residual of the clean round is `hseat0 : seats.contains 0` (the
Leg-S who-routing residual, design § 9.2). Board equality is stated CELL-WISE (as everywhere in this
tree — `Board` carries function fields, so `=` is neither decidable nor what any capstone states).

`BoardAgrees b1 b2` is the board half of `RoundStateAgrees`: same size, same automaton, cell-wise
equal. Everything `roundStep` reads out of the board bottoms out in `cellAt` / `size` / `automaton`,
so each board-derived quantity is congruent under `BoardAgrees` — LITERALLY equal (as a function or
list) for the marks-independent ones, `BoardAgrees` again for the boards `resolveMoves` /
`automatonStepCfg` produce. -/

/-- **`braid_sat_imp_runTurn` — THE M7 WHOLE-TURN CAPSTONE (n = 11, P = 2).**

Given a chain of accepted Leg C conflict rounds `Cs` whose decoded RoundState windows seam
(`FoldSeam`) into the clean round's accumulated state `rmRoundStateIn tR`, and the clean round's
resolve-marks (`tR`) + step (`tA`) traces satisfying the M6 hypotheses (with `marksIn` carried by the
seam), the whole multi-round turn `runTurn` RESOLVES, and its final board is — cell for cell — the
board decoded off the step trace `tA`. The conflict rounds are threaded by M2 through the
`RoundStateAgrees` congruence of `roundStep`; the clean round is M6. -/
