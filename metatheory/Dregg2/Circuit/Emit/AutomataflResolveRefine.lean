# Dregg2.Circuit.Emit.AutomataflResolveRefine — LEG R, the SAT ⇒ SEMANTICS refinement of the
byte-pinned automatafl m=2 move-adjudication descriptor (`automataflResolveDesc`).

## What this file IS

`AutomataflResolveEmit.lean` is Stage 1: the Leg R descriptor STRUCTURE, byte-pinned by an
`emitVmJson2` `#guard` (306 columns, 371 constraints, 32 public inputs). This file is Stage 2: for
each of the descriptor's eight legs, a theorem DERIVING the reference semantics
(`Dregg2.Games.Automatafl`) from the EMITTED constraints on a satisfying, canonical trace. Nothing
is assumed: every fact is extracted from a constraint proved to be a MEMBER of the byte-pinned
`automataflResolveDesc.constraints` (`by decide` over the fold-generated list), exactly as
`AutomataflStepRefine.lean` closed Leg A.

The field glue (`Canon`, `bin_of_gate`, `eq_of_modEq_canon`, `forcedGe0_core`, `StepCanon`,
`codeToParticle`) is REUSED from `AutomataflStepRefine`; it is descriptor-agnostic.

## DEFECT #4, FOUND HERE AND NOW FIXED AT SOURCE — the board cells were NOT range-checked

`automataflStepDesc` carries `boardRangeConstraints` — `assert_member(cell, {0,1,2,3})` on every
OLD and NEW board column. That family is what let Leg A's capstone be UNCONDITIONAL.

`automataflResolveDesc` HAD NO SUCH FAMILY, and that was LOAD-BEARING, not cosmetic. The
source-non-vacuum bit is `anz = forced_ge0(fp − 1, SMALL_RBITS=5)`, so a witnessed source particle
`fp = 4` satisfies `anz = 1` (the circuit treats the cell as CARRYING A PIECE) while
`codeToParticle 4 = .vacuum` (the reference treats it as EMPTY) — and the 5-bit comparison supplies
no a-priori window that would exclude it. A satisfying witness with an out-of-alphabet cell
therefore made the capstone FALSE.

FIXED: `AutomataflResolveEmit.boardRangeConstraints` now emits `assert_member(cell, {0,1,2,3})` on
every OLD and MID board column (constraints 371 → 379, wire golden re-pinned, descriptor
regenerated). The `BoardAlphabet` envelope is consequently a THEOREM here — `boardvalid_of_sat` —
extracted from the byte-pinned constraint list, and `srcNonVac_of_sat` no longer takes it as a
hypothesis. Every result in this file is UNCONDITIONAL: there is no assumed envelope left.

## DEFECT #5, FOUND HERE AND NOW FIXED AT SOURCE — the identical-move turn was UNSATISFIABLE

`write_mid_witnessed`'s cell polynomial subtracted `carry_i·src_i[c]·old[c]` once PER PIECE. When
both moves cleared the SAME square (`frm_a = frm_b` with both sources carrying — two players
proposing the identical move, which the reference explicitly does NOT treat as a conflict, see
`Automatafl.conflictResolve`) the old particle was subtracted TWICE, forcing `mid[frm] ≡ −old[frm]`.
Since DEFECT #4's alphabet gates pin both cells into `{0,1,2,3}`, that forced `old[frm] = 0` —
contradicting the carry. The leaf was UNSATISFIABLE on that legal turn: a COMPLETENESS defect
(soundness was never at risk — a legal turn was refused, no forged board admitted).

FIXED: `AutomataflResolveEmit.writeCellHead` now carries the SHARED-ENDPOINT inclusion–exclusion —
`+ A·C·old` (a shared source is vacated exactly once) and `+ B·D·old − B·D·particle_b` (a shared
landing deposits exactly one particle). Constraint COUNT is unchanged (379); the wire golden was
re-pinned and `circuit/descriptors/by-name/automatafl-resolve.json` regenerated (drift gate PASS).
The canary polarity is FLIPPED: `canonDoubleGood` now SATISFIES both the cell gate and the alphabet
gate at `mid = 0`, and the two forges (`mid = −1`, the OLD forced value; `mid = 1`, source not
vacated) are REJECTED — so the fix MOVED the pinned value rather than widening the gate.
`cellAlgebra` consequently no longer takes `A·C = 0` / `B·D = 0` as hypotheses: those two
configurations are now LIVE, satisfiable cases. (The `NN = 2` specialization
`sharedSourceVacatesOnce` went out with the retired assembly — see §6.5.)

## What is CLOSED here, and what is NOT (the honest residual)

CLOSED: R1 (auto pin) · R2 (`validate_move` ⇒ `MoveValid`, witnessed source read) · R3 (witnessed
`is_vertical`, occlusion) · the R4 pattern bits, selection truth table and `srcNonVac`
(unconditional) · (a) `boardvalid_of_sat` · (b) `conflictResolve_pair` · (c) the REFERENCE half of
the `m = 2` caterpillar (`chainDest_a`/`chainDest_b`) · (d) `cellAlgebra`, the degree-7 board-update
collapse to the four indicator products (eleven live cases of sixteen, the five excluded ones being
ONLY the same-piece `A·B = C·D = 0`).

Also CLOSED, in `Dregg2.Games.Automatafl` (reference side, no circuit content):

  * §8b THE SEAM LEMMA — `automatonStep_congr`: two boards agreeing on `size`, `automaton`,
    `useColumnRule` and every IN-BOUNDS cell step to boards agreeing on every in-bounds cell.
    This is what the whole-turn composition needs, because the Leg R → Leg A seam is a CELL-WISE
    agreement (what a `mid_root` PI equality gives) and NOT a `Board` equality. Built on
    `raycastFuel_congr` / `raycast_congr` / `automatonOffset_congr`.
  * §8c THE REFERENCE UNFOLDING, residual (ii), CLOSED — `applyMoves_cell_TT/TF/FT/FF`: the
    `filter`/`map`/`find?` pipeline of `applyMoves bd [ma, mb]` evaluated per cell in all FOUR
    `(anz, bnz)` shapes of `pieceSrcs`, into the same per-cell if-chain the gate computes
    (landing-A first, then landing-B, then vacuum on a cleared source, else the old cell — the
    reference's `find?` list order IS the gate's `B`-before-`D` priority).

RETIRED — the `NN = 2` ASSEMBLY (was §6.5; see §6.5's supersession note):

  * `resolve_sat_imp_resolveMid` (LEG R'S OLD CAPSTONE) and everything that existed only to serve
    it — `boardDecodeMid`, `prod_of_sat`/`notBit_of_sat`/`carry_of_sat`/`ft_of_sat` and their four
    instances, `dstOneHot_of_sat`/`writeCell_of_sat`, `oneHotPair_indicator`/`srcIndicator_of_sat`/
    `dstIndicator_of_sat`/`sharedSourceVacatesOnce`, `ResolveFacts`/`resolveFacts_of_sat`,
    `midCell_of_facts`, and the §E two-sided `resolveMid` canaries — are DELETED. It concluded
    `mid = resolveMid(old, moves)` over the emitted `mid` columns, and that board carries the
    occlusion / flow-through / 2-cycle defects that CHUNK-3/5/6 were emitted to correct.
  * THE LIVE CAPSTONE is `AutomataflResolveMovesCapstone.resolve_sat_imp_roundBoardN` —
    `n`-generic, against the VALIDATED `AutomataflRules.roundBoard`, over the FINAL corrected board
    `cMidV4`. THE LIVE WHOLE TURN is `AutomataflTurnCapstone.turn_sat_imp_roundStep_pi` at the
    deployed `n = 11`. The V2 `resolve_step_sat_imp_applyTurn` was retired earlier (§D.6b): its
    crypto-free seam rode the `mid` commitment, and the commitment now packs `cMidV4`. This file
    supplies the Leg-R side of that emitted seam via `resolve_midPack_pi_of_sat`.

There is no `sorry`, no assumed arithmetization hypothesis, no assumed mid-board link beyond that
named seam, and no weakened or vacuous capstone standing in for either.

## Axiom hygiene

`#print axioms` on every exported theorem; the subset is `{propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}`.
No `sorry`, no `native_decide`, no assumed arithmetization hypothesis.

EVERY threshold bit in the descriptor (`iv`, `eqx`, `eqy`, `occ`, `anz`, `bnz`, the four
`eq_coords` bits) is `forced_ge0` over the SAME head shape `(Head.lin 1 val).addConst (-1)`, i.e.

SMALL `D`, the bit IS the comparison — a forged bit has no satisfying decomposition. -/

/-! ## §5 — R4: the four `eq_coords` pattern bits + the fork/collide/survive selection.

The pattern bits (§5.1) and the selection ALGEBRA (§5.2) are UNCONDITIONAL. Tying the selection to
the reference `conflictResolve` (§5.4) additionally needs the source-non-vacuum bits to mean
"the source cell is non-vacuum", which is where the descriptor's MISSING board-alphabet range check
(§0, the defect) becomes load-bearing: it is carried as the explicit `BoardAlphabet` envelope. -/

/-- **THE PARTICLE-ALPHABET ENVELOPE — now a THEOREM (`boardvalid_of_sat`), not a hypothesis.**

DEFECT #4, as this refinement found it: `automataflResolveDesc` emitted NO
`assert_member(cell,{0,1,2,3})` family (contrast `AutomataflStepEmit.boardRangeConstraints`, which is
exactly what made Leg A's capstone unconditional). Without it a satisfying witness could carry
`old c = 4`, which `codeToParticle` decodes to VACUUM while the circuit's
`anz = forced_ge0(fp − 1, 5)` reads as NON-VACUUM — a genuine descriptor/reference DISAGREEMENT over
the whole window `fp ∈ [4, p)`, which made the naive capstone FALSE.

FIXED AT SOURCE: `AutomataflResolveEmit.boardRangeConstraints` now emits the `KK + KK` membership
gates on every OLD and MID board column, the wire golden was re-pinned (371 → 379 constraints), and
this predicate is DERIVED from the descriptor by `boardvalid_of_sat` below. It survives as a named
`Prop` only because it is the convenient shape to thread through the alphabet-sensitive lemmas. -/

/-! ## §5.5 — (b) R4 COROLLARY: the emitted selection IS the reference `conflictResolve`.

The circuit's leg 4 computes three booleans (`fork`, `collide`, `surv`) out of four coordinate-pair
equality bits and two source-non-vacuum bits. The reference computes a LIST: it filters `[ma, mb]`
by "touches no conflicted source and no conflicted destination", where each conflict is an
order-free `hasTwoDistinct` over a sub-list. These are different shapes; this section proves them
the same object at `m = 2`.

The key structural facts, both proved below by exhausting the four decidable equalities: at a
2-element move list `frmConflict` and `toConflict` take the SAME value on `ma` as on `mb` — so the
filter keeps BOTH moves or NEITHER — and those values are literally the circuit's `fork` and
`collide` patterns. -/

section ConflictPair

/-- `frmConflict` at `m = 2` is the circuit's `fork` pattern `eq_ff ∧ ¬eq_tt`, on either move. -/
theorem frmConflict_pair (ma mb : Move) :

/-- `toConflict` at `m = 2` is the circuit's `collide` pattern
`eq_tt ∧ ¬eq_ff ∧ anz ∧ bnz`, on either move. The two non-vacuum conjuncts enter because the

/-! ## §5.6 — (c), the REFERENCE HALF of R5: the `m = 2` caterpillar, resolved.

Leg 6 of the descriptor computes two flow-through bits and interpolates each piece's landing square
between its own `to` and the other piece's `to`. The reference computes the same landing by
`followChain` over the move graph `nextOf`. These four lemmas resolve the reference side completely
at `n = 2`: the move graph is a two-entry lookup table (`nextOf_pair` — using `occluded_false_n2`,
so no occlusion survives at this board size), and the chain terminates in exactly the three shapes
the circuit's `ft` bit distinguishes:

  * `followChain_own` — no chain relation (`to_a ≠ frm_b`): the piece lands on its OWN `to`;
  * `followChain_own_landing` — the chain relation holds but the next square is a PIECE source
    (`bnz`, the circuit's `¬ft` conjunct): the caterpillar STOPS there, again the piece's own `to`;
  * `followChain_flowThrough` — the chain relation holds, the next square is VACATING (`¬bnz`) and
    the 2-cycle is broken (`to_b ≠ frm_a`, the circuit's `¬eq_ba` conjunct): the piece flows
    THROUGH to `to_b`. This is exactly `ft_a = 1 ⇒ dest_a = to_b`.

The three cases are jointly exhaustive and pairwise exclusive on the same conditions the emitted
`flowThroughConstraints` branch on, so the reference landing square is a function of precisely the
circuit's `ft` bit. What is NOT yet proven here is the CIRCUIT half of R5 (an `ft_of_sat` extractor
tying the `cFtA`/`cFtB` columns to those conditions) — see the file header for the residual. -/

square it was standing on, i.e. `to_a`. The circuit agrees by NEGATION: `ft_a` carries the `¬eq_ba`
conjunct, so `ft_a = 0` and the interpolated destination is the piece's own `to_a`.

discharged); it is `frm_a` — the move FAILS TO EXECUTE, defect #8's fix — when `to_a` holds a
carrying piece with no move of its own; and the piece's own `to_a` otherwise. This is the reference
half of R5, complete.

The MIDDLE branch is the one the pre-fix reference got wrong (it landed on `to_a` and dropped the
piece standing there). It is EMPTY at the descriptor's call sites — see the two uses in §C, where
`ps` is `[frm_a]` / `[frm_b]` / `[frm_a, frm_b]` and the conjunct is unsatisfiable — which is why
the emitted `ft` gates still match the reference at `NN = 2`. -/

/-! ### §5.8.1 — The FIELD ALGEBRA of the per-cell board-rewrite gate.

`cellAlgebra` is the degree-7 board-update collapse: over the four indicator products
`A = carry_a·src_a[c]`, `B = carry_a·dst_a[c]`, `C = carry_b·src_b[c]`, `D = carry_b·dst_b[c]` it
turns a congruence mod `p` into the reference's per-cell VALUE, for every cell and every board with
no case analysis upstream. It is a PURE integer statement — no descriptor, no board size — and it is
the ONE survivor of the retired `NN = 2` per-cell assembly: the LIVE `n`-generic board-cell proofs
in `AutomataflResolveMovesCapstone` (§25/§26/§27) consume it directly against the FINAL corrected
board `cWBoardV4`. -/

/-- **(2) THE PER-CELL REWRITE, RESOLVED.** With the ONLY remaining structural exclusion (a cell is
never both a cleared source and a landing of the SAME piece: `A·B = C·D = 0`), the emitted cell
polynomial evaluates to exactly the reference `applyMoves` rewrite of that cell: a landing piece's
particle, else vacuum on a cleared source, else the old cell kept. Eleven live cases out of sixteen;
the other five are the same-piece exclusions.

DEFECT #5's fix is visible right here: the SHARED-SOURCE case `A = C = 1` and the SHARED-LANDING
case `B = D = 1` are now LIVE cases with a satisfying `midc` (`0` and `pa` respectively), where
before they were hypotheses (`hAC`, `hBD`) ruling the configurations out as unsatisfiable. -/

/-! ## §6.5 — THE `NN = 2` ASSEMBLY IS RETIRED. SUPERSEDED BY `resolve_sat_imp_roundBoardN`.

What used to stand here — `boardDecodeMid`, the `NN = 2` circuit half of legs 5/6
(`prod_of_sat`/`notBit_of_sat`/`carry_of_sat`/`ft_of_sat`/`carry{A,B}_of_sat`/`ft{A,B}_of_sat`), the
per-cell `write_mid` gate (`dstOneHot_of_sat`/`writeCell_of_sat`), the indicator glue
(`oneHotPair_indicator`/`srcIndicator_of_sat`/`dstIndicator_of_sat`/`sharedSourceVacatesOnce`), the
fact bundle `ResolveFacts`/`resolveFacts_of_sat`, the per-cell assembly `midCell_of_facts`, LEG R'S
OLD CAPSTONE `resolve_sat_imp_resolveMid`, and the §E two-sided `resolveMid` canaries — is DELETED.

WHY, not "cleanup": it proved a board that is WRONG. `resolve_sat_imp_resolveMid` concluded
`mid = resolveMid(old, moves)` over the emitted `mid` columns, and those columns carry the
occlusion / flow-through / 2-cycle defects that CHUNK-3/5/6 were emitted to correct — the wounds
`AutomataflResolveMovesCapstone.flowThroughOcclusionGap_witness_n3`,
`twoCycleStay_witness_n3` and `AutomataflResolveCapstone.occludedStayer_witness_n3` exhibit by
`decide`. The commitment PI now packs the FINAL corrected board `cMidV4` (§D.5,
`resolve_midPack_pi_of_sat`), so the old `mid` columns are on NO published path.

THE LIVE CAPSTONE is `AutomataflResolveMovesCapstone.resolve_sat_imp_roundBoardN` — `n`-generic,
against the VALIDATED `AutomataflRules.roundBoard`, over `cMidV4` — and the live whole turn is
`AutomataflTurnCapstone.turn_sat_imp_roundStep_pi` at the deployed `n = 11`.

WHAT SURVIVES HERE and why: §D.5's packed-commitment transport (the seam ingredient, re-pointed to
`cMidV4`), §D.7/§D.8's `n`-generic adjudication core + coordinate extractions (the live capstone's
inputs), `cellAlgebra` (§5.8.1, consumed by the live V4 board-cell proofs), and the `NN = 2`
gate-bundle / non-vacuity canaries (§6/§7), which pin that the BYTE-PINNED `n = 2` descriptor's
gates bite. -/

/-! ## §D.5 — LEG R's PACKED COMMITMENT TRANSPORT (the seam ingredient).

Leg R adopted the packed base-4 commitment (`NGen.commitBoardsConstraints`), so its published PIs
are the packed felts of the OLD board (`[16, 16+fc)`), the packed felts of the MID board
(`[16+fc, 16+2fc)`) and the automaton coordinate. These lemmas are the Leg-R mirror of
`AutomataflCommitRefine`'s Leg-A instances, and they are what turns the whole-turn seam from a
hypothesis about BOARDS into a hypothesis about PUBLIC INPUTS. All `n`-generic; no chip lookup, no
hash, no soundness assumption. -/

/-! ## §D.6b — THE V2 WHOLE-TURN THEOREM `resolve_step_sat_imp_applyTurn` IS RETIRED.

It proved `new = applyTurn(old, moves)` at `NN = 2` by discharging the cell seam from Leg R's MID
commitment pack transport. The commitment now packs the FINAL corrected board `cMidV4` (not the V2
`mid`), so that crypto-free seam over the `mid` columns no longer exists — and its `applyTurn =
automatonStep ∘ resolveMid` conclusion is the SUPERSEDED V2 spec (the buggy board the occlusion /
2-cycle corrections were built to fix). The correct whole turn is
`AutomataflTurnCapstone.turn_sat_imp_roundStep_pi` at the deployed `n = 11`, over `roundStep` /
`resolveMoves` / `cMidV4`, with the cell seam now a fully EMITTED-crypto-free consequence of
`resolve_midPack_pi_of_sat` (this file, re-pointed to `cMidV4`). -/

/-! ## §D.7 — THE OCCLUSION-INDEPENDENT ADJUDICATION CORE, AT ARBITRARY BOARD SIZE `n`.

Everything above is keyed at the frozen `NN = 2` (`automataflResolveDesc`). This section re-proves the
part of Leg R's argument that is *occlusion-independent and coordinate-independent* — the
`fork`/`collide`/`survive` selection truth-table (Leg 4), the carries (Leg 5) and the flow-through
bits (Leg 6) — as ARGUMENTS OVER AN ARBITRARY `n`, off `Satisfied2 (automataflResolveDescN n)`.

WHY THESE AND NOT THE WHOLE CAPSTONE. Legs 4/5/6 compute booleans out of the pattern bits and the
non-vacuum bits by PURE GATE ALGEBRA — no coordinate window, no board enumeration, no occlusion. So
their proofs port verbatim from the `NN = 2` originals with only the descriptor swapped
(`automataflResolveDescN n`) and the membership drawn from the already-`n`-generic
`AutomataflResolveMembership` (`mem_selection_idx` / `mem_carry_idx` / `mem_flowThrough_idx`, whose
families are fixed-length lists whose positions do NOT move with `n`). `selectionConstraints n`,
`carryConstraints n` and `flowThroughConstraints n` are literally the same 6 / 4 / 14 gates as the
frozen ones, so every polynomial-shape `rfl` and every `norm_num` closes unchanged.

WHAT THE COORDINATE FAMILY NOW REACHES (§D.8, off the `AutomataflCoord` foundation). The
COORDINATE-DEPENDENT extractions that needed the `[0, n)` window are now closed at ARBITRARY `n`:
`sourceReadN_of_sat` (the witnessed source read, off `oneHotN_of_sat` + `dot_oneHot2`),
`validMoveN_of_sat` (`validate_move` ⇒ the reference `MoveValid`, off `coordN_of_sat` +
`autoPinN_of_sat` + `sqdistN_pure`), `ivN_of_sat` (the witnessed `is_vertical`), `eqCoordsN_of_sat`
(the four pattern bits) and `srcNonVacN_of_sat` (the source-non-vacuum bit). The `{0,1}` reasoning
(`coord01_of_sat` / `interval_cases` / `sqdist_pure` / the 4-cell split) is replaced by the
foundation's `coordN_of_sat` UPPER-edge decode and the generalised `sqdistN_pure`/`sq1dN_pure` under
EXPLICIT board-size windows (`2·(n−1)² < p`, `2^(rbits+1) ≤ p`, and for the 9-bit `is_vertical` /
`eq_coords` distance sites the honest cap `dist ≤ 999` that the FIXED `RBITS = 9` decomposition
imposes). All five are `#print axioms`-clean and non-vacuous at `n = 3`.

WHERE THE CAPSTONE ACTUALLY LIVES. The `NN = 2` capstone that once sat above is RETIRED (§6.5) — it
proved the SUPERSEDED `mid` board. The composition these extractions feed is
`AutomataflResolveMovesCapstone.resolve_sat_imp_roundBoardN`: `n`-generic, against the VALIDATED
`AutomataflRules.roundBoard`, over the FINAL corrected `cMidV4`, with the occlusion leg discharged
NON-VACUOUSLY through `AutomataflOcclusionBridgeN.occ_iff_occluded_of_sat` (arbitrary `n`) rather
than the `occluded_false_n2` vacuity a 2-line supplies. What remains here at `NN = 2` is the
byte-pinned descriptor's own gate-bundle and non-vacuity record (§6/§7) plus the reference-side
`m = 2` lemmas (§5.5/§5.6) — kept because they are pure `Automatafl` statements with no descriptor
content, not because anything downstream is waiting on them. -/

/-! ## §D.8 — THE COORDINATE-DEPENDENT EXTRACTIONS, AT ARBITRARY BOARD SIZE `n`.

This section closes the FIRST family of the honest residual §D.7 named: the extractions whose frozen
proofs pinned coordinates to `{0,1}` (`coord01_of_sat` / `interval_cases` / `sqdist_pure` / the 4-cell
board enumeration). Each is re-proved off `Satisfied2 (automataflResolveDescN n)` at ARBITRARY `n`,
using the just-landed `AutomataflCoord` foundation (`coordN_of_sat`, `oneHotN_of_sat`, `dot_oneHot2`)
in place of the `{0,1}` reasoning, and the already-`n`-generic `AutomataflResolveMembership` injectors.

The window facts (`(n:ℤ) < p`, `2·(n−1)² < p`, `2^(rbits+1) ≤ p`) are EXPLICIT, discharged-at-call
inequalities on the board size — trivially true at every realistic `n` and non-vacuous at `n = 3` —
not assumed circuit facts. -/

/-! ### §D.8.5b — LEGALITY re-pointed to the VALIDATED spec (`AutomataflRules.MoveLegal`).

The migration re-targets move-legality from the OLD `Automatafl.MoveValid` to
`AutomataflRules.MoveLegal`. Two clauses change (design Δ2):

* **the automaton square is banned as a SOURCE ONLY.** `MoveLegal` drops the `¬ isAutomaton to`
  gate — naming the automaton as a DESTINATION is legal to propose and simply fails to execute (the
  occupied square blocks the inclusive path, §5b). The emitted `validate_move` still PROVES
  `¬ isAutomaton to` today, so `MoveLegal` follows as a WEAKENING of `MoveValid` on that clause; the
  gate-drop itself is a later descriptor re-emit.
* **marks-membership.** `MoveValid`'s `¬ isConflict frm ∧ ¬ isConflict to` (which read
  `Board.conflictAt`, never set in the OLD tree) becomes `frm ∉ marks ∧ to ∉ marks` against the
  round's committed marker set. The current descriptor has NO marks columns, so this is supplied as
  a HYPOTHESIS (`hfrm`/`hto`) — the labelled round-composition seam Phase 3 discharges from the marks
  PI commitment. On the opening round `marks = []`, so it is vacuous and `moveLegalN_of_sat`
  discharges it outright.

Fork/collide (`AutomataflRules.forkAt`/`collideAt`) are the SAME predicates as the old
`frmConflict`/`toConflict` — already proven equal to the `d3` selection truth table in
`AutomataflAir.conflictResolve_pair` — so the conflict-detection leg re-points by rename, not
re-proof. -/

/-- **`validate_move` ⇒ `AutomataflRules.MoveLegal`, general marker set.** Everything but
marks-membership comes from the emitted `validate_move` (via `validMoveN_of_sat`); the
`frm ∉ marks`/`to ∉ marks` clauses are the Phase-3 round-composition seam, supplied here as
hypotheses. -/

and `ge0_5N_of_sat` (the 5-bit non-vacuum threshold), with the particle-alphabet envelope re-derived
`n`-generically at the read cell from the emitted `assert_member` gate (DEFECT #4's fix, `n`-generic

/-! ## §7 — NON-VACUITY canaries: the gates BITE.

Each canary evaluates the ACTUAL emitted gate polynomial on a good assignment (`== 0`, satisfied)
and on a forged one (`!= 0`, rejected). Two-sided, so none of the above is a vacuous implication. -/

/-- The auto pin: a board that does NOT hold AUTO at the witnessed one-hot index has no witness. -/
def canonAutoGood : Assignment := fun c =>
  if c = old 0 then 3 else if c = selAutoRow 0 ∨ c = selAutoCol 0 then 1 else 0
def canonAutoForge : Assignment := fun c =>
  if c = selAutoRow 0 ∨ c = selAutoCol 0 then 1 else 0

#guard (headToExpr autoPinHead).eval canonAutoGood == 0    -- AUTO really at (0,0): gate holds
#guard (headToExpr autoPinHead).eval canonAutoForge != 0   -- forged empty cell: gate FAILS

/-- The distinctness `cond_nonzero`: a move with `frm == to` (so `dsq = 0`) has NO inverse witness,
whatever the prover picks for `distinct_inv`. -/
def canonDistinctExpr : EmittedExpr := gCondNonzero ONE (cDsq (mvBase 0)) (cDistinctInv (mvBase 0))
def canonDistGood : Assignment := fun c =>
  if c = ONE ∨ c = cDsq (mvBase 0) ∨ c = cDistinctInv (mvBase 0) then 1 else 0
def canonDistForge : Assignment := fun c =>
  if c = ONE ∨ c = cDistinctInv (mvBase 0) then 1 else 0   -- dsq = 0: the degenerate "move"

#guard canonDistinctExpr.eval canonDistGood == 0     -- dsq = 1, inv = 1: satisfied
#guard canonDistinctExpr.eval canonDistForge != 0    -- dsq = 0 (frm == to): NO witness, REJECTED

/-- The `write_mid_witnessed` cell gate: a forged MID cell (a "dropped move" lie, or any rewrite
that does not match `resolve_mid`) fails the per-cell equality. Here both carries are `0`, so the
gate degenerates to `mid[0] == old[0]`: the board must be UNCHANGED when nothing journeys. -/
def canonMidExpr : EmittedExpr := headToExpr (writeCellHead 0)
def canonMidGood : Assignment := fun c => if c = old 0 ∨ c = mid 0 then 2 else 0
def canonMidForge : Assignment := fun c => if c = old 0 then 2 else 0  -- mid[0] forged to VACUUM

#guard canonMidExpr.eval canonMidGood == 0     -- no carry: mid == old, gate holds
#guard canonMidExpr.eval canonMidForge != 0    -- forged mid (piece silently deleted): REJECTED

/-- The `surv` inclusion–exclusion gate: claiming SURVIVAL while a fork is detected fails. -/
def canonSurvExpr : EmittedExpr :=
  headToExpr (((((Head.lin 1 cSurv).addConst (-1)).addLin 1 cFork).addLin 1 cCollide).addProd (-1)
    [cFork, cCollide])
def canonSurvGood : Assignment := fun c => if c = cSurv then 1 else 0
def canonSurvForge : Assignment := fun c => if c = cSurv ∨ c = cFork then 1 else 0

#guard canonSurvExpr.eval canonSurvGood == 0    -- no fork, no collide, surv = 1: consistent
#guard canonSurvExpr.eval canonSurvForge != 0   -- fork = 1 but surv = 1 claimed: REJECTED

/-- The occlusion `seg` gate at `n = 2`: the strictly-between mask is FORCED to zero, so a prover
cannot manufacture an interior blocker to fake an occlusion. -/
def canonSegExpr : EmittedExpr := headToExpr (segHead (occBase 0) 0)
def canonSegGood : Assignment := fun _ => 0
def canonSegForge : Assignment := fun c => if c = cSeg (occBase 0) 0 then 1 else 0

#guard canonSegExpr.eval canonSegGood == 0     -- seg = 0: the only satisfying value
#guard canonSegExpr.eval canonSegForge != 0    -- forged interior cell: REJECTED

/-- **THE DEFECT-#4 CANARY.** The newly emitted board-cell alphabet gate REJECTS exactly the witness
that broke the capstone: `old[0] = 4`, which the circuit's `anz = forced_ge0(fp − 1, 5)` would have
read as "carries a piece" while `codeToParticle 4 = .vacuum` reads it as empty. Two-sided: an
in-alphabet cell passes, the out-of-alphabet cell that made the refinement FALSE does not. -/
def canonAlphaExpr : EmittedExpr := memberExpr (old 0) [0, 1, 2, 3]
def canonAlphaGood : Assignment := fun c => if c = old 0 then 2 else 0   -- ATTRACTOR: legal
def canonAlphaForge : Assignment := fun c => if c = old 0 then 4 else 0  -- the DEFECT witness

#guard canonAlphaExpr.eval canonAlphaGood == 0    -- in-alphabet cell: ACCEPTED
#guard canonAlphaExpr.eval canonAlphaForge != 0   -- `old[0] = 4`: REJECTED (was accepted before)
#guard (memberExpr (mid 0) [0, 1, 2, 3]).eval (fun c => if c = mid 0 then 4 else 0) != 0
#guard cg (memberExpr (old 0) [0,1,2,3]) ∈ automataflResolveDesc.constraints
#guard cg (memberExpr (mid 3) [0,1,2,3]) ∈ automataflResolveDesc.constraints

/-- **THE CARRY CANARY.** The carry gate `carry == sa1·(1 − occ)` REJECTS a prover who claims the
piece journeyed while its line was occluded: with `sa1 = 1` and `occ = 1` the only satisfying carry
is `0`, so the forged `carry = 1` fails. -/
def canonCarryExpr : EmittedExpr :=
  headToExpr (((Head.lin 1 cCarryA).addProd (-1) [cSa1]).addProd 1 [cSa1, cOcc (occBase 0)])
def canonCarryGood : Assignment := fun c => if c = cSa1 ∨ c = cCarryA then 1 else 0
def canonCarryForge : Assignment := fun c =>
  if c = cSa1 ∨ c = cCarryA ∨ c = cOcc (occBase 0) then 1 else 0

#guard canonCarryExpr.eval canonCarryGood == 0     -- clear line, source carries: carry = 1 holds
#guard canonCarryExpr.eval canonCarryForge != 0    -- occluded but carry claimed: REJECTED

/-- **THE FLOW-THROUGH CANARY.** `ft` rides `not_bit(bnz)`: a prover who wants the chain bonus must
claim the square ahead is VACATING. Claiming `¬bnz` while `bnz = 1` fails the pin, so a piece can
never flow through a square that still holds a piece. -/
def canonFtExpr : EmittedExpr := headToExpr (((Head.lin 1 cNBnz).addLin 1 cBnz).addConst (-1))
def canonFtGood : Assignment := fun c => if c = cNBnz then 1 else 0
def canonFtForge : Assignment := fun c => if c = cNBnz ∨ c = cBnz then 1 else 0

#guard canonFtExpr.eval canonFtGood == 0     -- bnz = 0, nBnz = 1: the honest vacating square
#guard canonFtExpr.eval canonFtForge != 0    -- bnz = 1 with nBnz = 1 claimed: REJECTED

/-- **THE DESTINATION-ONE-HOT CANARY.** The landing selector is pinned to the INTERPOLATED
destination `to_own + ft·(to_other − to_own)`. With `ft = 0` and `ty_a = 1` the only satisfying
selector is `1`: a prover cannot land the piece on a square the `ft` bit did not select. -/
def canonDstExpr : EmittedExpr :=
  headToExpr (((Head.lin 0 (wDstRow 0 0)).addLin 1 (wDstRow 0 1)).append
    ((destHead (cTy (mvBase 0)) (cTy (mvBase 1)) cFtA).scale (-1)))
def canonDstGood : Assignment := fun c =>
  if c = wDstRow 0 1 ∨ c = cTy (mvBase 0) then 1 else 0
def canonDstForge : Assignment := fun c => if c = cTy (mvBase 0) then 1 else 0

#guard canonDstExpr.eval canonDstGood == 0     -- ft = 0: the piece lands on its OWN `to`
#guard canonDstExpr.eval canonDstForge != 0    -- landing square forged away from `to`: REJECTED

/-- **THE DEFECT-#5 CANARY, POLARITY FLIPPED (the completeness fix, witnessed).** On the
identical-move turn (`frm_a = frm_b`, both carrying) the emitted cell gate USED TO subtract the
source particle twice, so the only satisfying `mid` at the shared source was `−old` — out of the
particle alphabet for every non-vacuum source, i.e. NO witness on a legal turn.

With the inclusion–exclusion overlap terms the shared source vacates ONCE: the honest `mid = 0`
now satisfies BOTH the cell gate and the alphabet gate. Two-sided, in both directions:

* GOOD — `mid[0] = 0` (vacated once): cell gate `== 0` AND alphabet gate `== 0`. The turn the
  descriptor previously could not prove is now PROVABLE.
* FORGE (i) — the OLD forced value `mid[0] = −1` is now REJECTED by the cell gate (so the fix did
  not merely widen the gate: it MOVED the pinned value).
* FORGE (ii) — `mid[0] = 1` (the source not vacated at all) is REJECTED: soundness intact, the
  cell is still pinned to exactly one value. -/
def canonDoubleBase : Assignment := fun c =>
  if c = old 0 ∨ c = particleCol 0 ∨ c = particleCol 1 then 1
  else if c = carryCol 0 ∨ c = carryCol 1 ∨ c = wSrcRow 0 0 ∨ c = wSrcCol 0 0
       ∨ c = wSrcRow 1 0 ∨ c = wSrcCol 1 0 then 1
  else 0
def canonDoubleGood : Assignment := fun c => if c = mid 0 then 0 else canonDoubleBase c
def canonDoubleForgeNeg : Assignment := fun c => if c = mid 0 then -1 else canonDoubleBase c
def canonDoubleForgeKeep : Assignment := fun c => if c = mid 0 then 1 else canonDoubleBase c

#guard (headToExpr (writeCellHead 0)).eval canonDoubleGood == 0       -- vacated ONCE: SATISFIED
#guard (memberExpr (mid 0) [0, 1, 2, 3]).eval canonDoubleGood == 0    -- and 0 IS a particle code
#guard (headToExpr (writeCellHead 0)).eval canonDoubleForgeNeg != 0   -- the OLD forced −old: GONE
#guard (headToExpr (writeCellHead 0)).eval canonDoubleForgeKeep != 0  -- source not vacated: REJECTED

/-- **THE SHARED-LANDING CANARY.** The other half of the inclusion–exclusion: both pieces landing on
the SAME square (the identical move's destination) deposits exactly ONE particle, not two. -/
def canonLandBase : Assignment := fun c =>
  if c = particleCol 0 ∨ c = particleCol 1 then 2
  else if c = carryCol 0 ∨ c = carryCol 1 ∨ c = wDstRow 0 0 ∨ c = wDstCol 0 0
       ∨ c = wDstRow 1 0 ∨ c = wDstCol 1 0 then 1
  else 0
def canonLandGood : Assignment := fun c => if c = mid 0 then 2 else canonLandBase c
def canonLandForge : Assignment := fun c => if c = mid 0 then 4 else canonLandBase c

#guard (headToExpr (writeCellHead 0)).eval canonLandGood == 0    -- ONE particle lands: SATISFIED
#guard (headToExpr (writeCellHead 0)).eval canonLandForge != 0   -- doubled deposit: REJECTED
