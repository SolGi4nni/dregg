# Dregg2.Circuit.Emit.BlindedMembershipWideEmit — the WIDE (8-lane node-fold) BLINDED membership
(E2 #2b — the real ~124-bit federation membership)

**This is Lean-authored AIR.** This module authors the algebra; Rust parses the emitted IR2 bytes
and supplies witnesses — it constructs no constraints.

## What this file IS

The WIDE additive replacement for the deployed depth-general blinded ring-membership descriptor
`BlindedMembershipEmit.blindedMembership4aryDesc` (staged-additive-then-cutover). The deployed
family is the HARD residual of felt-width finding **#2** (federation;
`docs/WOUND-felt-width-boundaries-2026-07-19.md`): its node fold chains on **lane 0 only** — each
level absorbs the four children as four SINGLE felts (`gParentLookup`, arity 4), the continuity
window ties one column (`next.cur = this.par` at `gCUR`/`gPAR`), and the blinding tooth absorbs
the member digest as ONE felt (`gBlindLookup`, arity 2) — so the interior of the tree, the root
PI, and the published blinded leaf are all ~31-bit (2^15.5-collidable) commitments, regardless of
how many permutation lanes the chip witnesses.

⚠ ANTI-MASQUERADE: `gPATH_LANES = [11..17]` — the 8 permutation lanes are ALREADY in the deployed
trace. Exposing them (or the top node's lanes) as PIs while the tree still chains lane-0 buys
NOTHING: the interior stays ~31-bit. This descriptor therefore widens the **fold** and the
**blinding preimage**, not the PI surface alone — a genuine Merkle-scheme change, the same one
`MerkleMembership4aryWideEmit` made for the plain membership family. E2 #2a
(`BoundPresentationWideEmit`) exposed the 8-felt federation root as PIs; together with THIS file
the membership side of wound #2 closes at ~124-bit — at the DEFERRED coordinated cutover below,
not before.

## The widened scheme

* Every node of the tree is a FULL 8-felt Poseidon2 digest (`Digest8`), not a lane-0 squeeze.
* The 4-ary node fold absorbs all 8 lanes of each child. Four 8-felt children are 32 felts —
  double the chip rate (`CHIP_RATE = 16`) — so the fold is realized as a balanced pair of
  arity-16 absorbs, all three bound at full output width by `chipLookupTupleN`:

      node8W(c0,c1,c2,c3) = A16( A16(c0 ‖ c1) ‖ A16(c2 ‖ c3) )

  where `A16` is the same arity-16 pack8 absorb the deployed heap/cap `node8` rows already ride
  (one chip, arity-tag-separated domains — inherited deployed practice, not new sharing).
* Chain continuity is 8 window gates — `next.cur[k] = this.par[k]` for EVERY lane k — where the
  deployed family has one.
* The position/arrangement gates are the deployed family's algebra (`gArrangeList`, the
  `child0Body..child3Body` shapes) applied per lane with SHARED position bits: the 8-felt running
  node sits at its `b0 + 2·b1` slot among the 8-felt siblings.
* **THE BLINDING IS PRESERVED.** The fresh blinding factor still rides the leaf, and leaf +
  blinding stay HIDDEN (the hiddenness is the unlinkability). What widens is the PREIMAGE: the
  wide blinding tooth absorbs all 8 leaf lanes plus the blinding felt in ONE absorb (arity 9 —
  9 ≤ CHIP_RATE — domain-separated from the arity-16 fold rows and every deployed arity 2/4/7 by
  the chip's arity tag) and publishes an 8-FELT blinded leaf, every output lane bound.
* PI layout `[blinded0..blinded7, root0..root7]` (piCount 16): the row-0 blinded leaf group is
  pinned to PIs 0..7, the last-row parent to PIs 8..15. The published commitment is widened WITH
  the root (the class-D lesson: an 8-felt root behind a 1-felt published commitment re-pins a
  31-bit key and buys nothing).

## What is proved here (and the named residual)

* `wChildren_arranged_lane` / `wGroups_arranged` — the arrangement gates pin the four 8-felt
  children to the positional arrangement of the 8-felt running node and siblings, every lane.
* `wideNodeFold_sound` — under a sound WIDE chip table (`ChipTableSoundN`), the three fold
  lookups force the parent group to the genuine two-stage fold `wideFold4` of the four child
  groups: the full 8-felt node binding, per row.
* `wideBlind_sound` — the wide blinding lookup forces the 8 published blinded-leaf columns to the
  genuine absorb of (all 8 leaf lanes ‖ blinding): the published commitment binds the WHOLE
  member digest, not its lane 0.
* `wCont_all_zero_iff` — the 8 continuity windows hold iff the NEXT row's 8-felt running node IS
  this row's 8-felt parent (the widened chain, stated at `Digest8`).
* **The anti-masquerade teeth**, in the collision-extraction discipline (`Coll8`; the
  injectivity-hypothesis style is refuted at deployed parameters — `Compress8CR` is false for the
  real chip — so a bare `∃` would be a free pass):
  - `interior_forge_narrow_admits_wide_refuses` — child quadruples agreeing on every lane 0 but
    differing at some lane j: (1) the deployed lane-0 blinded fold yields EQUAL parents at zero
    cost (the forge the deployed descriptor admits); (2) equal WIDE parents hand back the
    specific, named, full-width chip collision `wideFoldColl8Find` returns — as DATA.
  - `blinded_leaf_forge_narrow_admits_wide_refuses` — the same class at the BLINDING boundary:
    two member digests agreeing at lane 0 publish the SAME deployed blinded leaf under the same
    blinding factor for free; equal WIDE blinded leaves extract the named collision on the full
    9-felt preimage.

NAMED RESIDUAL: the full multi-row `Satisfied2 ⇒` recomposed-blinded-path refinement (the
`*Refine`-tier walk composing `wideNodeFold_sound` + `wideBlind_sound` + `wCont_all_zero_iff` +
`wGroups_arranged` across the trace) is deferred to a `BlindedMembershipWideRefine` module. The
deployed depth-general narrow family (`blindedMembership4aryDesc`) carries no such refinement
either; the per-row teeth here are strictly more than parity.

## DEFERRED coordinated deploy (integrator, one epoch)

The Rust consumer repoint (`blinded_membership_witness_4ary`, `circuit/src/poseidon2_air.rs`'s
`generate_blinded_*`, `bridge/present.rs`), the descriptor-JSON golden regen into
`circuit/descriptors/`, and the `vk_hash` registry rotation are the coordinated cutover; nothing
here changes the deployed descriptor or its registry entry.

/-! ## §1 — the trace column layout: every Merkle value is an 8-lane group; the blinding rides.

One 4-ary level per trace row (depth = trace height), as in the deployed family — but the running
node, the three siblings, the four ordered children, and the parent are each a FULL 8-felt digest
group. The path block (columns 0..89) is laid out identically to `MerkleMembership4aryWideEmit`;
past it sit the blinding felt and the 8-felt published blinded leaf. UNLIKE the plain wide
membership, the row-0 running node (the member leaf digest) is NOT PI-pinned — it stays HIDDEN;
only its blinded image is published. -/

The deployed blinded family's `gParentLookup` absorbs the four children as four SINGLE felts

Here every absorb input is a whole 8-lane group and every output lane is bound by
`chipLookupTupleN`. -/

blinding felt — 9 ≤ `CHIP_RATE`, one absorb, arity-tag-separated (9) from the arity-16 fold rows
and every deployed arity (2/4/7). The blinding factor stays a HIDDEN fresh felt: unlinkability is
untouched; only the preimage widens. -/

/-! ## §7 — the anti-masquerade teeth (collision-extraction discipline).

The injectivity-hypothesis style is REFUTED at deployed parameters (`Compress8CR` is false for
the real chip — it compresses `List ℤ` into 8 bounded lanes), so both teeth follow the
`DeployedCapTree` `…_binds_or_collides` discipline: conclusions hand back the SPECIFIC colliding

/-- The deployed 1-felt blinded node fold, stated of the same 8-felt data: absorb ONLY lane 0 of

lane 0 (so the deployed 1-felt blinded fold cannot tell them apart) but differ at lane `j` of the
first child — the interior-forge class wound #2 names. Field-faithfully:
