# `Dregg2.Circuit.Emit.EffectLowerCertified` — ⚑ THE LOWERING EMITS ITS OWN REFINEMENT.

`EffectLowerCore.lowerAir` returns an `EffectVmDescriptor2` and nothing else. Measured at source
(2026-08-06), what follows BY CONSTRUCTION from a leg today is:

  * `lowerLeg_ne_nil` — a leg contributes ≥ 1 constraint. A COUNT fact; it says nothing about what
    the constraint means.
  * `AirNormalForm.headToExpr_isNormal` — the emitted body is canonically RENDERED. A shape fact.
  * `refuse_bites` — an inexpressible leg lowers to an unsatisfiable pair. A refusal, and it needs
    `isFirst ∨ isLast` to bite (both halves are `.boundary`s), so it is a TRACE-level tooth.
  * `lowerConstraint_holdsAt_iff` — the ONE genuine per-leg refinement lemma in the tree, and it
    covers ONE of the seven leg kinds (`.gate`).

For the other six kinds — `lookup`, `window`, `pin`, `limbs`, `chal`, `bind` — there was no lemma
saying "this leg, lowered, forces X". Every consumer re-established it by hand at the descriptor,
from the TARGET constructor's reduction lemmas (`holdsVm_piFirst_true`, `lookup_replaces_range`,
`chip_lookup_sound`, `gateBody_eval`). Measured over `metatheory/Dregg2/Circuit/`: **508
constraint-membership theorems across 141 files**, **88 uses of `holdsVm_piFirst_true`**, **351
uses of the `Int.modEq_iff_dvd` + `omega` mod-`p` lift** — the same handful of facts, re-derived
once per descriptor.

## What this module adds

`AirLeg.forces` — **the SOURCE SEMANTICS of a leg**, by structural recursion, stated in the
SOURCE's vocabulary (`Expr.eval`, `WindowExpr.eval`, membership in `tf table`, the PI equality) and
never mentioning `lowerLeg`. Then one refinement lemma per leg kind, one combined
`lowerLeg_forces`, and the composition `lowerAirLegs_forces` — which is genuinely compositional:
it is `List.mem_flatMap` on the emission and `List.all_eq_true` on the verdict, nothing per-leg.
`lowerAirCertified` is the entry point that returns the descriptor PAIRED WITH that proof.

⚑ **`EffectAir.mainRailOk` is the degenerate instance, and it becomes the side condition.** The
existing decidable verdict is exactly the hypothesis the refinement lemma needs: a leg the main
rail cannot take has no image to refine to. `hok` is discharged `by decide` at every real air block.

## ⚠ WHAT WOULD MAKE THIS VACUOUS, and the discipline against it

A `forces` that said "the lowered constraints hold" would be `P → P` — the identity-carrier sin.
`AirLeg.forces` is defined WITHOUT reference to the lowering, in the source grammar, so the lemma
has to cross a real gap (`emitExpr_eval`, `windowToLocal_eval`, the `RowSel` → `onTransition`
dispatch, the lane-vector `map`). §6 exhibits BOTH POLES on a concrete row: a leg whose `forces`
HOLDS, and a leg whose `forces` is FALSE — refuted, not merely unproved.

## ⚠ WHAT IT DOES NOT BUY — stated here, not in a footnote

`forces` is the deployed mod-`p` denotation, NOT ℤ. The lift needs the canonicality envelope and
that stays a real hypothesis (`EffectLowerCore.eq_of_modEq_canon`). And it cannot make an AIR
*mean* the right thing: it makes the descriptor force what its legs SAY. A leg that says the wrong
thing is refined faithfully into a descriptor that forces the wrong thing. §7 is the largest
measured instance of exactly that, and answers it with a SECOND verdict rather than a better lemma.

## Axiom hygiene
No `sorry`, no `native_decide`, no new axiom. NEW file; imports read-only; ADDITIVE — `lowerAir` is
unchanged and `lowerAirCertified.val` is `lowerAir` by `rfl`, so no emitted byte moves.

/-! ## §1 — THE SOURCE SEMANTICS. What a leg CLAIMS, in the source's own vocabulary.

⚑ It lives in the SOURCE IR's namespace (`Dregg2.Circuit.EffectAirIR`), not the lowering's. A
denotation that lived with the compiler would be a denotation the compiler could bend; a leg's
meaning belongs to the leg.

Three properties this definition is built to have, and each is a way it could have been vacuous:

1. **It never mentions `lowerLeg`.** A denotation defined as "the emitted constraints hold" proves
   nothing; the refinement lemma would be `rfl`.
2. **It carries the ROW GUARDS the deployed AIR actually applies.** A `.gate` is vacuous on the
   wrap row (`EffectVmEmit.holdsVm_gate_true`), a first-row pin is vacuous off row 0. Stating
   `forces` unguarded would be stating something the descriptor does not force.
3. **It is stated mod `p`.** `VmConstraint.holdsVm` asserts a congruence; claiming ℤ equality here
   would be claiming the deployed canonicality envelope for free. -/

/-- ⚑ **`AirLeg.forces` — the leg's own claim about a row window.**

Read the arms as the source language's semantics, one per constructor:

* `gate` — the equation holds on the TRANSITION domain, which is where the deployed
  `when_transition()` arm binds and nowhere else.
* `pin` — the pinned column agrees with the published slot ON THE PIN'S ROW.
* `lookup` — the evaluated tuple is a row of the queried table.
* `limbs` — EVERY limb is a row of the declared range table. One claim per limb, not one for the
  vector: a dropped limb has to move the denotation, not only the constraint count.
* `window` / `chal` — the body vanishes, under the scope the `RowSel` names.
* `bind` — the guard is a bit and the DECLARED halves tie the lane vectors.

⚠ `chal .first`/`.last` are `True`: the target has no first/last challenge form, `ChalLeg.mainRailOk`
refuses them and `lowerChalLeg` emits the refusal. The source genuinely claims nothing there, and
the refusal is what carries that case — not this definition. -/

/-! ### §1a — ⚑ THE TIE VERDICT'S VOCABULARY: which columns a leg DERIVES.

Kept here with the IR rather than with the lowering, for the same reason `forces` is: it is a fact
about the source. §7 is what it buys. -/

/-- Columns an expression reads. -/
def exprCols : Expr → List Nat
  | .var v   => [v]
  | .const _ => []
  | .add a b => exprCols a ++ exprCols b
  | .mul a b => exprCols a ++ exprCols b

/-- Columns a window body reads; `loc c` and `nxt c` are the same column. -/
def windowCols : WindowExpr → List Nat
  | .loc c   => [c]
  | .nxt c   => [c]
  | .const _ => []
  | .add a b => windowCols a ++ windowCols b
  | .mul a b => windowCols a ++ windowCols b

/-- Columns a challenge body reads. ⚑ `.chal i` contributes NOTHING: a challenge is not a column,
and folding it in would connect every challenge gate through a phantom node. -/
def chalCols : ChalExpr → List Nat
  | .loc c   => [c]
  | .nxt c   => [c]
  | .const _ => []
  | .chal _  => []
  | .add a b => chalCols a ++ chalCols b
  | .mul a b => chalCols a ++ chalCols b

/-- ⚑ **The columns a LEG relates — and `pin` contributes `[]`, on purpose.** A pin ties a column
to a PUBLIC INPUT, not to another column: it publishes, it does not derive. That asymmetry is the
defect being measured, so it is written into the IR rather than discovered by a census afterwards
(`LightClientAnchorConnectivity.relatedCols` is the same choice, one rail down). -/
def AirLeg.readCols : AirLeg → List Nat
  | .gate c   => exprCols c.lhs ++ exprCols c.rhs
  | .pin _    => []
  | .lookup l => l.tuple.flatMap exprCols
  | .limbs l  => l.cols
  | .window w => windowCols w.body
  | .chal c   => chalCols c.body
  | .bind b   => exprCols b.guard ++ b.commit.flatMap exprCols ++ b.vk.flatMap exprCols
                   ++ (b.bound.getD []).flatMap exprCols

/-- ⚑ **A leg JOINS iff it relates at least two distinct columns.** An arity-1 range lookup and a
one-column forcing gate both fail this, and both should: neither ties its column to anything. -/
def AirLeg.joins (l : AirLeg) : Bool := 2 ≤ l.readCols.eraseDups.length

/-- ⚑ **THE TIE VERDICT — every published column is DERIVED by some other leg.** The `mainRailOk`
shape, applied to the defect `mainRailOk` cannot see. Decidable, on the source, before any byte. -/
def EffectAir.pinsTied (air : EffectAir) : Bool :=
  air.legs.all fun l =>
    match l with
    | .pin p => air.legs.any (fun m => p.col ∈ m.readCols)
    | _      => true

/-- ⚑ …and the STRICTER form: the pinned column must be tied by a leg that JOINS it to another
column. The gap between the two verdicts is exactly the unary-thread class of §7. -/
def EffectAir.pinsJoined (air : EffectAir) : Bool :=
  air.legs.all fun l =>
    match l with
    | .pin p => air.legs.any (fun m => m.joins && p.col ∈ m.readCols)

/-! ## §2 — the bridges the per-leg lemmas cross.

Each of these is a place the source grammar and the target grammar genuinely differ. If any were
`rfl` the refinement would be a restatement. -/

`lookup`/`bind` bridge; `CircuitEmit.emitExpr_eval` is its one-expression form. -/

  simp [List.map_map, Function.comp_def, emitExpr_eval]

/-- ⚑ **A body that does not read the next row HAS a row-local form.** `windowToLocal?` is a
genuinely partial conversion; `WindowLeg.mainRailOk` at `.all`/`.first`/`.last` is
`!readsNext body`, and this is what turns that decidable verdict into the totality the lowering
needs. Without it the boundary arms could only be proved by case-splitting on a conversion that
might fail — i.e. not at all. -/

/-! ## §3 — ⚑ THE PER-LEG REFINEMENT LEMMAS. One per constructor, each NAMED.

Every one has the same shape and it is the shape the design turns on:

    the leg is main-rail expressible  →  its lowered constraints hold on a row window
                                      →  the leg's own claim holds on that row window

`hok` is `mainRailOk`, the verdict that already exists. That is the sense in which `mainRailOk` is
a degenerate instance of this design rather than a separate mechanism. -/

variable (hash : List ℤ → ℤ) (tf : TraceFamily) (env : VmRowEnv) (isFirst isLast : Bool)

/-- **GATE.** The lowered gate on the transition domain IS the source equation, mod `p`. This is
`lowerConstraint_holdsAt_iff` lifted to the leg. -/
theorem lowerLeg_forces_gate (c : Constraint)

  subst hlast
  exact (lowerConstraint_holdsAt_iff hash tf env isFirst c).mp
    (h (lowerConstraint c) (by simp [lowerLeg]))

/-- **PIN.** The lowered `piBinding` forces the column/slot congruence exactly on the pin's row —
the fact `holdsVm_piFirst_true` states about the TARGET constructor, here stated about the LEG. It
is used 88 times in the tree, re-derived at each site. -/

/-- **LOOKUP.** The queried tuple, evaluated in the SOURCE grammar, is a row of the table. Crosses

/-- **LIMBS.** ⚑ ONE claim PER LIMB, so a dropped limb is visible in the denotation and not only in
the constraint count. `LimbsLeg.mainRailOk` already refuses the empty vector and any width above
the wrap-free ceiling 29; this is what those refusals buy. -/

content: `.transition`/`.all` land on `windowGate`'s `onTransition` flag, `.first`/`.last` on a

well as the dispatch. -/

/-! ## §4 — ⚑ COMPOSITION. The part that makes it a design rather than seven lemmas.

`lowerAirLegs` is a `flatMap`, so leg membership and constraint membership compose by
`List.mem_flatMap`; `EffectAir.mainRailOk` is a `List.all`, so the per-leg verdict composes by
`List.all_eq_true`. Neither step knows anything about any leg kind: adding an eighth constructor
costs one arm of `forces` and one per-leg lemma, and this section is unchanged. -/

/-- **The air block's legs are all forced.** -/
theorem lowerAirLegs_forces (air : EffectAir) (hok : air.mainRailOk = true)

  · exact (List.all_eq_true.mp hok) l hl
  · exact List.mem_flatMap.mpr ⟨l, hl, hvc⟩

/-- **…and so are the flat guard gates**, on the transition domain. Together with the above this is
everything `assemble` put in front of the caller's `framePins`. -/

/-- **The descriptor's constraints force every leg.** The air legs sit in the middle of
`gates ++ legs ++ framePins`, so leg membership lifts to descriptor membership by two appends. -/

/-! ## §5 — ⚑ THE CERTIFIED ENTRY POINT. `lowerAir` that returns its own soundness.

The dependent pair is the whole proposal in one definition: a caller cannot obtain the descriptor
without obtaining the proof, and cannot obtain the proof for an air block `mainRailOk` refuses.

⚑ **ADOPTION IS FREE.** `.val` is `lowerAir` by `rfl`, so a descriptor that switches to this emits
identical bytes; nothing re-emits, no VK rotates. What changes is that the emit does not ELABORATE
for an air block whose verdict is false — the discipline `PiDeclaration.withPiManifest` applies to
public inputs, applied to the lowering itself. -/

/-- **What a certified lowering promises**, spelled as a `Prop` so the pair's type is readable and
so a consumer can name the obligation without unfolding the subtype. -/
def CertifiedRefines (d : EffectVmDescriptor2) (cs : ConstraintSystem) (air : EffectAir) : Prop :=
  ∀ (hash : List ℤ → ℤ) (tf : TraceFamily) (env : VmRowEnv) (isFirst isLast : Bool),
    (∀ vc ∈ d.constraints, vc.holdsAt hash tf env isFirst isLast) →
      (∀ l ∈ air.legs, l.forces tf env isFirst isLast)
      ∧ (∀ c ∈ cs, isLast = false → c.lhs.eval env.loc ≡ c.rhs.eval env.loc [ZMOD PMOD])

/-- ⚑ **`lowerAirCertified` — the descriptor AND the proof that it refines its source.** -/
def lowerAirCertified (name : String) (traceWidth piCount : Nat) (cs : ConstraintSystem)
    (air : EffectAir) (hok : air.mainRailOk = true) :
    { d : EffectVmDescriptor2 // CertifiedRefines d cs air } :=
  ⟨lowerAir name traceWidth piCount cs air,
   fun hash tf env isFirst isLast h =>
     ⟨lowerAir_forces hash tf env isFirst isLast name traceWidth piCount cs air hok h,
      lowerAir_forces_gates hash tf env isFirst isLast name traceWidth piCount cs air h⟩⟩

/-- **The certificate costs no byte.** -/

    (air : EffectAir) (hok : air.mainRailOk = true) :
    (lowerAirCertified name traceWidth piCount cs air hok).val
      = lowerAir name traceWidth piCount cs air := rfl

/-! ## §6 — ⚑ BOTH POLES, on a concrete row. `forces` is a real predicate, not a tautology.

If `AirLeg.forces` were "the lowered constraints hold" it would be unrefutable. It is refutable. -/

/-- A pin publishing column 3 at slot 1, on the first row. -/
def demoPinLeg : PiPinLeg := ⟨VmRow.first, 3, 1⟩

/-- A row whose column 3 is `7` and whose slot 1 is `7` — the pin's claim HOLDS. -/
def demoEnvOk : VmRowEnv :=
  { loc := fun c => if c = 3 then 7 else 0
  , nxt := fun _ => 0
  , pub := fun k => if k = 1 then 7 else 0
  , chal := fun _ => 0 }

/-- The SAME row with the published slot moved to `8` — the pin's claim is FALSE. -/
def demoEnvForged : VmRowEnv := { demoEnvOk with pub := fun k => if k = 1 then 8 else 0 }

/-- **THE HONEST POLE.** -/
theorem demoPin_forces_holds (tf : TraceFamily) :
    (AirLeg.pin demoPinLeg).forces tf demoEnvOk true false := by
  show _ = true → _
  intro _
  decide

/-- ⚑ **THE RED POLE — `forces` is FALSE on the forged row.** Refuted by the kernel, so the
predicate has content: the certified lowering is not carrying a tautology. -/
theorem demoPin_forces_refuted (tf : TraceFamily) :
    ¬ (AirLeg.pin demoPinLeg).forces tf demoEnvForged true false := by
  intro h
  have hx : (demoEnvForged.loc 3 ≡ demoEnvForged.pub 1 [ZMOD PMOD]) := h rfl
  revert hx
  decide

/-- …and the forged row is refused by the EMITTED constraint too, which is the other half: the
predicate that goes false corresponds to a descriptor that rejects. -/
theorem demoPin_descriptor_rejects (hash : List ℤ → ℤ) (tf : TraceFamily) :
    ¬ (∀ vc ∈ lowerLeg (.pin demoPinLeg), vc.holdsAt hash tf demoEnvForged true false) := by
  intro h
  exact demoPin_forces_refuted tf
    (lowerLeg_forces_pin hash tf demoEnvForged true false demoPinLeg h)

/-! ## §7 — ⚑ THE DEFECT THE REFINEMENT CANNOT SEE, made structural instead.

`lowerAirCertified` makes a descriptor force what its legs SAY. It is structurally incapable of
noticing a leg that says the wrong thing — and the corpus's largest measured defect is exactly
that: a `pin` leg's claim (`loc col ≡ pub idx`) is TRUE of a column nothing else constrains, so the
prover chooses both sides and the refinement is faithful and worthless.

Measured on the emitted corpus 2026-08-06 (`circuit/descriptors/by-name/*.json`, 111 descriptors,
3,912 pins): **157 pins publish a column NO other constraint reads**, and **97 of 111 descriptors
would pass `pinsTied` unchanged**. Under the stricter joins-≥-2-columns reading
(`LightClientAnchorConnectivity.decorativeAnchors`, whose armed baseline is 417) the count is
larger and the largest single row is 192 of 219 published felts.

So the answer is not a better refinement lemma. It is a SECOND decidable verdict, in the same shape
as `mainRailOk`, on the SOURCE — where a pin can still be refused before any byte exists. -/

/-- ⚑ **`TiedAir` — DECORATION IS UNREPRESENTABLE.** Not detectable: unrepresentable. A value of
this type cannot be built for an air block that publishes a column no other leg derives, because
the field is a proof obligation and the `by decide` default fails.

That is the difference from a census: a census reports a number after the fact, and every one of
the measured decorative felts was found by a census after the fact. -/
structure TiedAir where
  air  : EffectAir
  /-- Main-rail expressible. -/
  ok   : air.mainRailOk = true := by decide
  /-- ⚑ Every published column is derived by another leg. -/
  tied : air.pinsTied = true := by decide

/-- **The certified lowering of a tied air block** — the two verdicts and the refinement, together,
in the type of the emit. -/
def lowerTiedAir (name : String) (traceWidth piCount : Nat) (cs : ConstraintSystem) (t : TiedAir) :
    { d : EffectVmDescriptor2 // CertifiedRefines d cs t.air } :=
  lowerAirCertified name traceWidth piCount cs t.air t.ok

theorem lowerTiedAir_val (name : String) (traceWidth piCount : Nat) (cs : ConstraintSystem)
    (t : TiedAir) :
    (lowerTiedAir name traceWidth piCount cs t).val
      = lowerAir name traceWidth piCount cs t.air := rfl

/-! ### §7a — both poles of the tie verdict. A verdict that cannot go red is decoration. -/

/-- A gate deriving column `3` from column `2`, plus a pin publishing `3`. The pin is TIED. -/
def demoTiedAir : EffectAir :=
  { legs := [ .gate ⟨.var 3, .var 2⟩, .pin ⟨VmRow.first, 3, 0⟩ ] }

/-- ⚑ **THE RED POLE** — the SAME pin with the gate deleted. Byte-wise this still publishes public
input `0`; nothing about the emitted pin changed. Its column is now derived by nothing, and the
verdict says so. -/
def demoDecorativeAir : EffectAir :=
  { legs := [ .pin ⟨VmRow.first, 3, 0⟩ ] }

theorem demoTiedAir_tied : demoTiedAir.pinsTied = true := by decide
theorem demoDecorativeAir_untied : demoDecorativeAir.pinsTied = false := by decide

/-- …and BOTH are main-rail expressible, which is the point: `mainRailOk` cannot see this defect,
so the verdict had to be a second one rather than a widening of the first. -/
theorem both_pass_mainRailOk :
    demoTiedAir.mainRailOk = true ∧ demoDecorativeAir.mainRailOk = true := by decide

/-- ⚑ **THE UNARY-THREAD CLASS, exhibited.** A window gate whose body reads ONE column
(`nxt 3 − loc 3`) ties column `3` to nothing — the shape the 192 published ξ-basis felts carry. It
passes `pinsTied` (the column IS read) and fails `pinsJoined` (nothing is joined to it). The two
verdicts disagree here, and the disagreement IS the measured defect. -/
def demoUnaryThreadAir : EffectAir :=
  { legs := [ .window ⟨RowSel.transition, .add (.nxt 3) (.mul (.const (-1)) (.loc 3))⟩
            , .pin ⟨VmRow.first, 3, 0⟩ ] }

theorem demoUnaryThread_passes_tied : demoUnaryThreadAir.pinsTied = true := by decide

theorem demoUnaryThread_fails_joined : demoUnaryThreadAir.pinsJoined = false := by decide

/-- The genuinely tied block passes BOTH. -/
