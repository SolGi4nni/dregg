# Dregg2.Circuit.Emit.EffectVmCapFamilyComplete — the CAP-FAMILY sorted-tree WRITE-gate completeness
  (`←`) + the per-tag `air_accepts ⟺ spec` at the 8-felt cap-tree write resolution.

## What this closes and what it does NOT (read the resolution honestly)

`RotatedKernelRefinementCapFamily.lean` supplies the SOUNDNESS half for the cap family: from a satisfying
DEPLOYED `Satisfied2 hash (effCapOpenWriteV3 <baseV3> …)` (via `effCapOpenWriteV3_forces_write8`) each
cap-family tag gets `<XSpec> ∧ writesTo8 S8 oldRoot k v newRoot` — the `→` (SAT ⟹ SEM) over the FULL
committed 8-felt BEFORE/AFTER cap-root blocks.

This file supplies the COMPLEMENTARY `←` content for the SORTED-TREE WRITE gate, at the SAME 8-felt
`recomposeUp8` / `capLeafDigest8` resolution the deployment commits, reusing the LANDED
`DeployedCapTree.Cap8Scheme` machinery (`capOpen8_binds_leaf_or_collides`, composing the spine walk
and the leaf peel — the arity-16 chip binding, EXTRACTED AS DATA) rather than re-authoring a parallel shape:

  1. **the REALIZABILITY `←` (`capWrite8_realizes` / the per-tag `_write_realizes`)** — "producing the
     membership-open / after-root columns that `writesTo8` forces, from a genuine `<XSpec>`-style spec":
     given the sorted-tree decode (a before-leaf keyed `k`, an after-leaf keyed `k` with the narrowed
     rights felt `v`, and a shared membership path `p`), the DEPLOYED write relation `writesTo8` is
     GENUINELY SATISFIED. The honest kernel move INHABITS the deployed relation — the `←` direction the
     soundness leg does not give.

  2. **the ANTI-FORGE (`capWrite8_afterRoot_binds_leaf_or_collides` + the `⟺` restored at a
     non-colliding candidate, `capWrite8_afterRoot_iff_of_noColl` / the per-tag `_iff_spec_of_noColl`)** — the
     content-bearing biconditional: along the committed membership path `p`, the published AFTER cap-root
     opens to an after-leaf `nl'` IFF `nl'` is EXACTLY the genuine spec-narrowed after-leaf. `→` is the
     8-felt anti-forge (`capOpen8_binds_leaf_or_collides`); `←` is `congrArg`, unconditional. Both
     directions are REAL and NON-VACUOUS (a forged after-leaf yields a DIFFERENT root — the mutation
     canary bites), and the biconditional carries the spec's `slot_hash = k` / `mask_lo = v` welds, so it
     reads `the after-root accepts nl' ⟺ nl' commits the spec's narrowed rights at the spec's key`.

Welded per tag with the LANDED soundness `→` (`X_descriptorRefines_capOpenSat`, consumed unchanged, NOT
re-authored), these give — modulo the ONE named carrier bundle — the two-directional `air_accepts ⟺ spec`
for the cap-tree write GATE at full ~124-bit width.

## The named carrier bundle (honest, NOT laundered) and the SCOPED residuals

The `⟺` is modulo ONE named carrier: **the sorted-tree decode** (the before/after leaves + the shared membership path `p` — the honest prover's
in-circuit cap-open readout). This is the `SpineCommits`/`writesTo8` "sorted-tree decode" the cap family
already carries; it is a HYPOTHESIS the honest prover discharges from its trace, never an axiom.

⚑ THE CHIP CR IS NO LONGER IN THE BUNDLE. It used to be `Cap8Scheme.chip8CR : Compress8CR chipAbsorb8`,
a STRUCTURE FIELD that is FALSE at deployed BabyBear parameters — so `Cap8Scheme` had no deployed value
and every `∀ S8 : Cap8Scheme, …` theorem in this file was VACUOUS rather than modulo-anything. The
field is DELETED. The `→` legs are now unconditional disjunctions naming the pair a total extractor
returns (`CapOpenColl`), and the `⟺` is restored under `¬ CapOpenColl` — an instance-local side
condition the deployed chip SATISFIES at every non-colliding pair, not a global injectivity it refutes.
The probabilistic price of the collision disjunct lives in `InjectiveFloorRegrounded` §1.

What this file DOES NOT claim, stated plainly (the SCOPED residuals):
  * It is the WRITE-GATE (`writesTo8` / cap-root binding) `⟺`, NOT a single `Satisfied2 (effCapOpenWriteV3
    …) ⟺ <full effect spec>` biconditional. The SAT-reconstruction `←` (build a satisfying
    `effCapOpenWriteV3` trace — the 16-level chip-lookup appendix — from the spec) is the StarkComplete
    DUAL carried as a realizable trace floor exactly as `CircuitCompletenessAuthorityConstruct`'s
    `CapOpenTraceFloor` carries the AUTHORITY-leg opening; it is NOT reconstructed here and is NOT
    near-instantiation.
  * The DEPLOYED forcing weakens the committed-path conclusion to the free-path existential `writesTo8`
    (the path is read off the trace's sib/dir columns — a genuine readout, hence part of the sorted-tree
    decode carrier, NOT a fresh study face); the anti-forge `⟺` is stated at the committed path `p` the
    decode carries.
  * The after-leaf's NON-key / NON-rights fields (`target`/`auth_tag`/`mask_hi`/`expiry`/`breadstuff`) are
    NOT welded by the deployed write gate (only `slot_hash = k` and `mask_lo = v` are) — the documented
    "`(k,v) ↔ CapLeaf` other-field encoding" residual (`writesTo8`'s def). The decode carries the full
    after-leaf; the `⟺` binds the after-root to THAT leaf.
  * The kernel `Caps`-function ↔ cap-tree-commitment lift (`capsMove`) is the named faithful-encoding
    residual the cap family already carries (`RotatedKernelRefinementCapFamily`), unchanged.

## Axiom hygiene

`#assert_axioms` ⊆ {propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}; crypto enters ONLY as the named
extracted-collision disjunct `CapOpenColl` (via `capOpen8_binds_leaf_or_collides`, inherited from
`DeployedCapTree`). ⚑ NO chip-CR HYPOTHESIS IS CARRIED ANYWHERE IN THIS FILE — the former
`Cap8Scheme.chip8CR : Compress8CR` FIELD is DELETED (it was false at deployed BabyBear parameters and
made `Cap8Scheme` uninhabitable, so every theorem here was vacuous). Consumes
`RotatedKernelRefinementCapFamily` / `CapOpenEmit` read-only.

/-! ## §1 — the GENERIC cap-tree write-gate cores (CR-carried; the two directions, discharged once).

`recomposeUp8 S8 (capLeafDigest8 S8 ·) path` is the 8-felt cap-tree opening: fold the leaf digest up the
committed sibling/direction path. The two cores below are the write gate's `→` (anti-forge: the after-root
BINDS the after-leaf) and `←` (realizability: the honest narrowed leaf REACHES the after-root along the
before-leaf's path). Both are pure `Cap8Scheme` — every cap tag instantiates them. -/

/-- **`capWrite8_afterRoot_binds_leaf_or_collides` — the 8-felt anti-forge (`→` core), UNCONDITIONAL.**
Along a FIXED membership path, two after-leaves opening to the SAME published after-root are EITHER
EQUAL, OR the deployed arity-16 chip genuinely COLLIDES at the two blocks `capOpen8Find` hands back. A
prover cannot keep the published after cap-root while swapping the written leaf except at that named
collision.

⚑ This replaces `capWrite8_afterRoot_binds_leaf`, which composed `recomposeUp8_inj_of_path` with
`capLeafDigest8_injective` — both discharged from the `Cap8Scheme.chip8CR : Compress8CR` FIELD. That
field is FALSE at deployed BabyBear parameters, so `Cap8Scheme` had NO deployed value and this theorem,
like every `∀ S8 : Cap8Scheme, …` statement in this file, was VACUOUSLY TRUE. The field is deleted;
`DeployedCapTree` §5b.D exhibits a real inhabitant, and the peel is now extraction-as-data. -/

IFF `nl' = nl`.

⚑ Read the hypothesis carefully — it is NOT the deleted floor. `¬ CapOpenColl S8 nl' nl p` is a claim
about TWO SPECIFIC input blocks, and it is SATISFIED by the deployed chip at every pair that is not one
of its (existent, by pigeonhole) collisions. The deleted `Compress8CR` quantified over ALL pairs and is
therefore refuted outright; this one is an instance-local, checkable, refutable side condition. That is
the whole difference between a vacuous keystone and a true one. -/

Assume exactly the injectivity the deleted `chip8CR` field asserted and the collision disjunct becomes
impossible, so the old bare `nl₁ = nl₂` falls straight out. What the deletion gave up is not a proved
conclusion — it is the pretence that the deployed arity-16 chip satisfies the hypothesis. Deliberately a
STANDALONE bridge and NOT a hypothesis on any keystone above: `Compress8CR` is FALSE at deployed
BabyBear parameters, so a keystone carrying it would be right back in the vacuity this repair removed. -/

SATISFIED at the openings of `bl`/`nl` along `p`. This is the "producing the membership-open / after-root
columns that `writesTo8` forces, from a genuine spec" leg: the constructed columns satisfy the relation. -/

/-! ## §2 — the per-tag sorted-tree WRITE DECODE + the per-tag `air_accepts ⟺ spec`.

Each cap tag carries a `<X>WriteDecode` — the honest prover's cap-open write readout: the before/after
leaves + the shared membership path, with the after-leaf's key pinned to the tag's committed cap key and
its rights felt to the tag's narrowed rights (the sorted-tree decode carrier). From it:
  * `<X>_write_realizes` — the DEPLOYED `writesTo8` at the tag's `(k, v)` is realized (`capWrite8_realizes`);
  * `<X>_afterRoot_binds_or_collides_spec` — the write-gate `→` (unconditional): the after cap-root
    binds exactly the tag's genuine narrowed after-leaf, OR the deployed chip collides at a named pair;
    `<X>_afterRoot_iff_spec_of_noColl` restores the `⟺` at any non-colliding candidate;
  * `<X>_write_forge_rejected_or_collides` — the mutation canary (a leaf that is NOT the genuine narrowed
    leaf cannot reach the published after-root, unless it exhibits the named chip collision).
The soundness `→` is the LANDED `RotatedKernelRefinementCapFamily.<X>_descriptorRefines_capOpenSat`
(consumed, not re-authored). -/

/-! ## §3 — INSERT effects (delegate / delegateAtten / introduce): the sorted-tree INSERT completeness.

For INSERT the DEPLOYED relation is `capInserts8 S8 oldRoot leaf newRoot` (a fresh edge grows the committed
key set by exactly `keyOf leaf`). Its both-directions key-set characterization is the LANDED
`capInsert_sound` (`∀ y, y ∈ keysOf newRoot ↔ y = keyOf leaf ∨ y ∈ keysOf oldRoot`). The NEW `←` glue is
`capInsert8_realizes` (the honest fresh edge INHABITS `capInserts8`) and the per-tag SPEC-WELDED
realization companion (`<X>_spec_and_insert_realized`). The after-tree leaf membership (`MembersAt8`) is
the honest prover's cap-open readout (part of the named sorted-tree decode carrier). -/

/-- **`capInsert8_realizes` — the DEPLOYED insert relation is realized from the decode (the `←`).** Given
the sorted-tree insert decode — the old root binds `spine`, the fresh key `keyOf leaf ∉ keysOf oldRoot`,
the after-leaf's membership in the new tree, and the new root binds `sortedInsert (keyOf leaf) spine` — the
DEPLOYED `capInserts8` is GENUINELY SATISFIED. The honest fresh edge inhabits the deployed insert. -/

`capRemove8_realizes` + the per-tag SPEC-WELDED companions. -/

/-- **`capRemove8_realizes` — the DEPLOYED remove relation is realized from the decode (the `←`).** Given
the sorted-tree remove decode — the old root binds `spine`, the revoked leaf's membership in the OLD tree,
its non-membership in the after tree, and the new root binds `sortedRemove (keyOf leaf) spine` — the DEPLOYED
`capRemoves8` is GENUINELY SATISFIED. -/

/-! ## §ROM — ⚑ THE ROM SUCCESSORS: the write-gate anti-forge legs as REDUCTIONS on the PROVED
keyed floor.

⚑ STATUS (2026-07-24). The seven `…_or_collides` exports of this file
(`capWrite8_afterRoot_binds_leaf`, `capWriteDecode_afterRoot_binds` /
`capWriteDecode_forge_rejected`, and their attenuate/refresh spec-named instances) are ONE
cap-open equivocation stated at three altitudes — all of them `Cap8Scheme.capOpen8Find` peels whose
exported form is a bare disjunction: at deployed BabyBear parameters a chip collision EXISTS by
pigeonhole, so each holds through its right branch with NO binding. They are RETAINED as the
deterministic extractor/decode machinery (the `CapWriteDecode` welds and the `⟺`-of-noColl forms
carry genuine circuit content). The SECURITY statements are `DeployedCapTree` §7R's reductions,
re-exported here at the write-gate site: the forger is an oracle program fixed before the sampled
tag-separated oracle, and the floor is `KeyedRomFloor.keyedRom_hard` (the birthday bound, a
THEOREM). The modelling step is §7R's note verbatim. -/
