# `Dregg2.Circuit.Emit.EffectVmKeyedStateCommit` — the per-effect state-commit binding, CLOSED on the
keyed, query-counted random-oracle floor (the floor that is PROVED, not the one that is refuted).

## What this is, and what fraud it undoes

A 07-22 swarm DELETED the per-effect commitment keystones (`…_commit_binds_block_or_collides` /
`…_commit_binds_state_or_collides`, 29 theorems across 16 emission files) and pointed their docstrings
at `Dregg2.Circuit.Emit.EffectVmCommitReduction` — a module that was imported by NOTHING, had NO olean,
and was NEVER ELABORATED, whose reductions moreover discharged efficiency at
`Eff := CostAdversary.IsPolyTime`, a floor `sysRoots_floor_polyTime_false_babyBear` PROVES FALSE at
deployed BabyBear parameters. Net effect: the per-effect anti-ghost bindings had NO machine-checked
statement anywhere in the built tree. That module is deleted; the extraction disjunctions are restored
in their files; and THIS module is the honest closure of the collision branch, on the keyed floor
(`Dregg2.Crypto.KeyedRomFloor` / `Dregg2.Crypto.RomBindingReduction`) — the floor whose hardness is a
THEOREM (the birthday bound), with the forger an ORACLE PROGRAM and no false hypothesis anywhere.

## ⚑ THE MODELLING STEP, SAID OUT LOUD (do not read past this)

`keyedRom_hard` requires a λ-GROWING digest space (`|R l| = 2^l`). The deployed sponge digest is a
FIXED 31-bit BabyBear felt; there is no `l` with `|BabyBear| = 2^l`. So this module's game families
are the STANDARD RANDOM-ORACLE IDEALIZATION of the GROUP-4 state-commit surface at an asymptotic
digest width — `vmSpongeFamily` samples `H : Unit × Block l → Fin (2^l)` uniformly, and the deployed
`hash : List ℤ → ℤ` slot of the emitted machinery is filled by `modelHash l H`. This is a MODELLING
step, taken deliberately and labelled — NOT a derivation about deployed Poseidon2. What survives at
the deployed hash without any idealization is the per-effect EXTRACTION disjunction
(`…_or_collides`, restored in each emission file): commit agreement forces absorbed-state agreement
OR hands back the concrete colliding pair. What THIS module adds is the probabilistic closure of that
collision branch — in the model where "collision" is an event over a SAMPLED oracle rather than a
pigeonhole certainty — for every QUERY-BOUNDED forger.

Also honest and explicit: the deployed `boundaryLastPins` step (`PI[NEW_COMMIT]` pins the commit
COLUMN mod `p = 2013265921`) does NOT transport into the λ-wide model — a `[0, p)` canonicality
hypothesis on a `2^l`-wide digest cell is UNSATISFIABLE for `l ≥ 31` on a colliding-with-reality
oracle output, and stating it would smuggle vacuity. So the model game's shared-commit hypothesis is
the commit COLUMN equality (the §7 block shape); the mod-`p` pin from the public input to the column
is deployed-side content and lives in the restored `…Descriptor_commit_binds_state_or_collides`.

## The shape (the honest successor of the deleted `…_from_polyTime` shape)

  * **The forger is an ORACLE PROGRAM** (`BreakComp`): per parameter, a `QueryBounded` tree over the
    tag-separated domain returning TWO ROWS (`VmRowEnv × VmRowEnv`). It learns the sponge only by
    querying it; the oracle is sampled after the tree is fixed.
  * **The win relation is the per-effect break**: both rows satisfy the effect's GROUP-4 hash sites
    (in the model), share the commit column, and DISAGREE on the absorbed 13-column state.
  * **The extractor is a PURE post-map** (`stateColl`): it peels the H4-of-H4 chain by comparing the
    INTER digest COLUMNS of the two rows (which `siteHoldsAll` pins to the genuine digests), so it
    needs NO oracle access of its own — `OracleComp.mapOut` applies and the query budget is
    PRESERVED (`breakFinder_in_romEff`), which is what replaces the `poly_time` answer-size discharge.
  * **The floor is PROVED**: `narrowStateCommit_binds` concludes from `keyedRom_hard` — the birthday
    bound — with no `IsPolyTime`, no `Poseidon2SpongeCR`, no named-carrier hypothesis.
  * **Both poles hold**: the win is SATISFIABLE (`breakWin_satisfiable` — a genuine equivocating row
    pair under a colliding oracle, so the closure is not `Negl` of an empty event), the class is
    inhabited (`probeComp_in_eff`), the extractor FIRES on the witness (`breakWitness_extracts`), and
    the unrestricted-adversary escape dies (`vmSponge_choiceAdv_excluded`,
    `narrowStateCommit_forger_excluded`).

`winsDec` on the break game is `Classical.propDecidable`: the win event's decidability is not
load-bearing (the probability is a finite count and every consumer is `noncomputable` already); no
statement below depends on how the instance decides.

## Axiom hygiene

`#assert_all_clean` ⊆ {propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}; no `sorry`, no fresh `axiom`, no
`native_decide`.
