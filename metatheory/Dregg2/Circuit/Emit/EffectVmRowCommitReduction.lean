# `Dregg2.Circuit.Emit.EffectVmRowCommitReduction` — the RUNNABLE EffectVM row's `state_commit`
binding as a SECURITY REDUCTION over EFFICIENT adversaries, on the shared one-felt sponge spine.

## The sin this retires

Every per-effect emission module exported its commitment binding as a BARE DISJUNCTION:

    absorbedCols e₁ = absorbedCols e₂ ∨ TransferColl hash e₁ e₂                            -- narrow
    (baseAbsorbedCols e₁ = baseAbsorbedCols e₂ ∧ roots agree) ∨ WideColl … ∨ RootsColl …   -- wide

Those were a real repair on their predecessors, which carried `Poseidon2Binding.Poseidon2SpongeCR` —
a floor the deployed BabyBear sponge REFUTES (`HashFloorHonesty.poseidon2SpongeCR_false_babyBear`), so
they were VACUOUS exactly where they were supposed to bind the deployed system. But the disjunctions
are still UNCLOSED: a collision EXISTS at deployed parameters by pigeonhole, so `binds ∨ collides` is
satisfiable through the `collides` branch WITHOUT `binds` ever holding. It quantifies over SOLUTIONS.
Cryptographic hardness quantifies over EFFICIENT ADVERSARIES.

## What replaces them, and where the pieces come from

The reduction spine is NOT re-authored here. `Dregg2.Crypto.SpongeCarrierReduction` already provides
it, once, for every one-felt sponge carrier in the tree: `SpongeKeyed` (the deployed sponge keyed by
its domain-separation tag), `spongeFamily`, `carrierBreakGame` (the forgery, with the break IN the win
relation), `carrierBreakToFinder` (the extractor AS A MAP OF ADVERSARIES), `carrier_adv_le` (the
UNCONDITIONAL advantage inequality — the adversary class does not appear in it),
`carrier_binds_advantage_bound` (the conclusion under `FloorGames.HashCRHardQuant (spongeFamily D) Eff`)
and, until 07-24, `carrier_binds_from_polyTime` (`hEff` at `Eff := IsPolyTime` — DELETED with the
floor's refutation; the discharged successor is `RomBindingReduction.romCarrier_binds`).

⚑ Why that spine and not a reduction hosted at `Circuit.Poseidon2KeyedBridge`: that bridge sits ABOVE
the whole `Emit/*` tree in the import graph (`Poseidon2KeyedBridge → FloorRegroundedConsumers →
CommitFaithfulRegrounded → EffectVmEmitRotationR → EffectVmEmitRotation → EffectVmEmitV2 →
EffectVmEmit*`). Importing it from an emission module is a BUILD CYCLE. (A sibling lane's module of
the same shape, `Circuit.Emit.EffectVmCommitReduction`, claimed to host such reductions but was
imported by NOTHING and never elaborated — vapor; it was DELETED 07-23, and the per-effect keystones
it pretended to replace are restored in their emission files, with their collision branch closed on
the PROVED keyed floor by `Circuit.Emit.EffectVmKeyedStateCommit`.) `SpongeCarrierReduction` restates
the same keyed sponge low in the graph for precisely this reason, and `Crypto.SpongeCarrierBridge`
PROVES (by `rfl`) that its family IS `Poseidon2KeyedBridge`'s. So this module is landed on the same
floor, reachable from where the rows live.

What THIS module adds, and it is only this:

  * **§1 — the two deployed EffectVM commitments as `SpongeCarrier`s.** `group4Carrier` is the
    narrow (13-column) `commitOf` — the H4-of-H4 whose fourth outer slot is the record digest;
    `wideStateCarrier` is the wide (`system_roots`-absorbing) `wideCommitOf`, whose fourth slot is the
    side-table digest, so ONE carrier covers BOTH of the wide commitment's collision legs (the GROUP-4
    tree and the ordered root list) and the reduction lands on ONE floor with no union bound. Each
    supplies the ONLY thing the spine asks for: a total extractor and its UNCONDITIONAL correctness.

  * **§2/§3 — the per-effect ROW games.** `narrowRowBreakGame E` / `wideRowBreakGame E` take the
    effect's OWN runnable descriptor: a win is two rows BOTH ACCEPTED by the deployed circuit
    (`satisfiedVm`) that publish the same commitment and yet bind different state. The descriptor is
    IN the game, so `mint`'s game and `burn`'s game are different types — the `FloorGames` lesson
    ("five names, one `Prop`" → five `Game`s) applied at the row layer. The lift into the carrier game
    is a map of adversaries with a win-preservation theorem.

  * **§4 — the TAMPER sub-games**, which are the `_rejects_state_tamper` / `_rejects_root_tamper`
    teeth: the same forgery with the disagreement PINNED to an absorbed state column, or to a named
    side-table root index.

  * **§5 — `winsDec` WITHOUT `Classical.propDecidable`.** The deployed row denotation is DECIDABLE
    (§0), so putting `satisfiedVm` inside a counted win event needs no classical choice and
    `Adversary.hit` stays a genuine computation.

## What is NOT closed (named, not faked)

This closes the SPONGE component of the runnable commitment binding. It does not touch the per-effect
ROW SEMANTICS (`decodeFull`/`fullClause`, proved separately and unconditionally), nor the cross-cell
`accounts` membership (the turn layer), nor the FRI/STARK floor beneath the proof system. And
`Eff := IsPolyTime` is a cost-VECTOR model of efficiency, not a machine model: what it buys is that
the ⊤-collapse witness is PROVED excluded (`CostAdversary.bruteForce_not_polyTime`) and the class is
PROVED inhabited, with both floor poles proved in `SpongeCarrierReduction` §5.

No `sorry`, no `axiom`, no `native_decide`, no `decide` on an opaque `Prop`. Cost stays SYNTACTIC.

the site list). No `Classical.propDecidable`, so `Adversary.hit` stays a genuine computation and the
counting probability is the honest finite one. -/

/-! ## §5 — ⚑ THE DISCHARGED HEADLINES, ON THE PROVED KEYED-ROM FLOOR.

The four `IsPolyTime` discharges that stood here (`narrowRow_binds_from_polyTime`,
`wideRow_binds_from_polyTime`, `wide_state_tamper_from_polyTime`, `wide_root_tamper_from_polyTime`)
carried `HashCRHardQuant (spongeFamily D) (IsPolyTime …)` — a floor
`Exec.SystemRootsBindingReduction.sysRoots_floor_polyTime_false_babyBear` PROVES FALSE at the
deployed sponge, and no `Eff` repairs the fixed-hash game (`Crypto.RomBindingReduction`'s header).
They are DELETED. The successors land the COMMITMENT layer on a SAMPLED oracle, where
`KeyedRomFloor.keyedRom_hard` (the birthday bound) is a THEOREM.

⚑ THE MODELLING STEP, STATED (not smuggled), the `Exec.SystemRootsBindingReduction` §7 discipline:

  * the sampled `H : Tag × Msg → Fin (2 ^ l)` replaces the fixed public sponge; there is NO `l` at
    which `Fin (2 ^ l)` is the deployed ~31-bit felt (birthday ≈ `2^15.5`, the felt-width wound);
  * the message domain is the TRUNCATED deployed absorb schedule, domain-separated by constructor
    inside ONE family: the three GROUP-4 state blocks (four BabyBear-range felts each — the deployed
    `wideBlockA/B/C` width, a `rfl` fact), the eight-root side-table sub-block, and the OUTER
    four-slot absorb whose entries are the inner digests (at the ideal width those are not felts —
    the SAME felt-width residual, carried visibly in the type);
  * the two-level nest `h [h A, h B, h C, h roots]` is genuinely re-absorbed: the oracle appears
    INSIDE the win relation, which is what neither single carrier could say.

⚑ WHAT THE ROM LAYER DOES NOT CARRY: the per-effect CIRCUIT-satisfaction content (`satisfiedVm` at
`E.descriptor`) is inherently about the fixed deployed hash and stays where it is honest — in §2–§4's
`_advantage_bound` forms, `hEff` in the open. The ROM successors price the COMMITMENT equivocation
those forms reduce to, which is exactly the leg the deleted discharges claimed and could not have. -/

`0`-query constant answerer on two distinct payloads is in `RomForgeryEff` at every budget; at the
constant oracle both nested commitments collapse, so it WINS there (positive advantage); and
`wideRow_binds_rom` applies to it — NEGLIGIBLE advantage. The exact `IsPolyTime`-refuting shape,

/-! ## §6 — the floor, PRICED at both poles, plus the canary and the positive pole.

Re-exported from `SpongeCarrierReduction` §5, where both poles are PROVED, so a reader of any
per-effect site can price its instantiation exactly without leaving the row layer. -/

/-- **⚑ THE ⊤ POLE — the floor is FALSE at the REAL BabyBear parameters** (the honest price of `hEff`).
A sponge whose output is a genuine BabyBear felt has finite range while `List ℤ` is infinite, so a
collision exists at every tag and the floor at the UNRESTRICTED class is FALSE. What the reduction buys
is NOT a floor the deployed sponge satisfies at ⊤ — no such floor exists — it is that the residual is
ONE named class with both poles proved, in place of a disjunction whose right branch is unconditionally
available at deployed parameters. -/

/-- **(TOOTH — the class §5 instantiates at is NOT EMPTY.)** Together with
`CostAdversary.bruteForce_not_polyTime` (the ⊤-collapse witness is PROVED excluded) this pins the
instantiated floor STRICTLY between the two poles. -/

/-- **(CANARY — the keystone does NOT follow from the floor applied at ANOTHER finder.)** Strip the
reduction: try to conclude the wide row forger's negligibility from the collision floor applied at some
OTHER finder `B`, not the one EXTRACTED from it. It does not go through — only `wideRow_adv_le` and
`carrier_adv_le` connect the extracted finder to the row game. This tooth REDS if a future edit
reconnects them. -/
