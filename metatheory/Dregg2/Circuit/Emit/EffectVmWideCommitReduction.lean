# `Dregg2.Circuit.Emit.EffectVmWideCommitReduction` — the WIDE `state_commit` anti-ghost, REBUILT as a
SECURITY REDUCTION on the grounded floor.

## What was here before, and why it was still a shirk

`Dregg2.Circuit.Emit.EffectVmFullStateRunnable` exports the whole commitment-binding core of the
RUNNABLE (`system_roots`-absorbing) EffectVM descriptor as FIVE bare disjunctions:

    wide_binds_or_collides                    (cols = cols ∧ carrier = carrier) ∨ WideColl …
    wide_binds_systemRoots_or_collides         (∀ i, sr₁ i = sr₂ i) ∨ WideColl … ∨ RootsColl …
    runnable_full_commit_binds_or_collides     (cols = cols ∧ ∀ i, sr₁ i = sr₂ i) ∨ WideColl ∨ RootsColl
    wide_rejects_state_tamper_or_collides      WideColl … ∨ RootsColl …
    wide_rejects_root_tamper_or_collides       WideColl … ∨ RootsColl …

Each was a genuine repair of a VACUOUS predecessor — they used to carry
`Poseidon2Binding.Poseidon2SpongeCR hash`, which the deployed BabyBear sponge REFUTES
(`HashFloorHonesty.poseidon2SpongeCR_false_babyBear`), so the old forms said nothing at all about the
deployed circuit.  But a bare `binds ∨ collides` is still a SHIRK: at deployed parameters a sponge
collision EXISTS by pigeonhole, so the disjunction is satisfiable through the `collides` branch with
`binds` never holding.  It quantifies over SOLUTIONS.  Cryptographic hardness quantifies over
EFFICIENT ADVERSARIES.  And the two `_rejects_*_tamper` teeth are the worst of the five: their
CONCLUSION is nothing BUT the two collision disjuncts, so as exported statements they promise a
tamper "costs" something whose price was never named.

⚑ **THOSE FIVE ARE NOT THE HEADLINE ANY MORE.**  This module supplies the headline, and
`EffectVmFullStateRunnable`'s docstrings now say so: the five disjunctions are DEMOTED to the
exact-Prop skeleton the win relations rest on (and to the base of the `_of_injective` strength
bridges), exactly as `Dregg2.Exec.SystemRoots` was demoted by
`Dregg2.Exec.SystemRootsBindingReduction` and `Market.WideCommitBoundary` demoted
`stateDecode8_pre_faithful`.  They are RETAINED rather than deleted because ~40 per-effect wide
keystones (bridgeMint, createCell, cellSeal, setPermissions, refreshDelegation, revokeDelegation,
pipelinedSend, exercise, noop, …) instantiate them as their deterministic skeleton; the EXPORTED
security claim about the wide commitment is now `wideCommit_binds_advantage_bound` /
`wideFullState_binds_advantage_bound` (fixed hash, `hEff` in the open) and the DISCHARGED
`wideCommit_binds_rom` / `wideFullState_binds_rom` below (keyed-ROM floor, PROVED — the
`_from_polyTime` discharges that stood here carried a refuted floor and are DELETED).

## The shape, and what it costs

The primitive is the deployed domain-separated Poseidon2 sponge
(`Crypto.SpongeCarrierReduction.spongeFamily D`) — the real `List ℤ → ℤ` the prover computes, keyed
by the tag it absorbs.  The whole reduction is inherited from
`Dregg2.Crypto.SpongeCarrierReduction`; this file supplies only

  * the two deployed CARRIERS — `wideAbsorbCarrier` (the `H4`-of-`H4` over the 12 absorbed
    state-block columns plus the `sysRootsDigestCol` felt) and `wideFullCarrier` (the same, with the
    carrier slot resolved to the `systemRootsDigest` of an eight-root sub-block),
  * their COLLISION EXTRACTORS, which are the file's OWN existing extraction spine reused rather than
    re-authored: `Poseidon2Binding.group4Find` for the GROUP-4 peel and
    `Exec.SystemRoots.rootsCollFind` for the roots peel, composed into ONE total function
    (`wideFullFind`) so the three-way disjunction becomes ONE extracted finder rather than a union
    bound over two,
  * the STRUCTURAL injectivity of the 12-column layout (`WideCols.eq_of_blocks`) — a fact about the
    LIMB LAYOUT, never about the hash,
  * the fixed widths (four felts per GROUP-4 block, eight per root sub-block) that discharge the
    `poly_time` output-growth slot.

Every deployed statement the five disjunctions made is re-expressed as "this configuration IS a win of
the forgery game" (`wideAbsorb_forgery_is_break`, `wideFull_forgery_is_break`,
`runnable_full_forgery_is_break`, `wide_state_tamper_is_break`, `wide_root_tamper_is_break`), and the
game's advantage is NEGLIGIBLE under the named floor.

⚑ **THE RESIDUAL, NAMED.** The floor is `HashCRHardQuant (spongeFamily D) Eff`, and at `Eff := ⊤` it
is FALSE at deployed BabyBear parameters (§5 — the honest price), at `Eff := ⊥` vacuous.
`Eff := IsPolyTime` sits strictly between: the ⊤-collapse witness is PROVED excluded
(`CostAdversary.bruteForce_not_polyTime`) and the class is PROVED inhabited.  What the rebuild buys is
not a floor the deployed sponge satisfies at ⊤ — no such floor exists — it is that the residual is ONE
named parameter with both poles proved, instead of a disjunct that is unconditionally available.

What it does NOT buy: the exact-Prop AIR layer and the computational game layer are still bridged
per-instance (the game samples a tag; a deployed trace fixes `deployedTag`), and the per-cell `Value`
`restLimbs` residuals (`slotCaveats`/`factories`/`lifecycle`/`deathCert`/`delegate`) ride
`CommitmentCrossBind.LeafIsCellCommit`, a separately-priced layer.

No `sorry`, no `axiom`, no `native_decide`, no `decide` on an opaque `Prop`.  Cost stays SYNTACTIC.

The deployed wide commitment absorbs exactly twelve state-block columns
(`bal_lo, bal_hi, nonce, fields[0..7], cap_root`) in three GROUP-4 blocks, plus the
`sysRootsDigestCol` carrier at the fourth outer slot.  `WideCols` is that twelve-felt payload as a

This is the reduction that replaces `wide_binds_or_collides` — the GENERIC ROOT every per-effect wide
keystone instantiates.  The bound domain is `WideCols × ℤ`: the twelve state-block columns and the
`sysRootsDigestCol` carrier read as an opaque felt (the carrier is NOT assumed to be a roots digest

/-! ## §3 — CARRIER 2: the wide commitment binds the WHOLE 17-field post-state.

The carrier slot resolved to the `systemRootsDigest` of an eight-root sub-block.  This is the
reduction that replaces `wide_binds_systemRoots_or_collides`,
`runnable_full_commit_binds_or_collides`, `wide_rejects_state_tamper_or_collides` and
`wide_rejects_root_tamper_or_collides` — all four were the SAME binding, projected four ways, which is
precisely why four bare disjunctions were four copies of one unpriced escape.

⚑ **THE THREE-WAY DISJUNCTION BECOMES ONE FINDER, NOT A UNION BOUND.** `wideFullFind` composes the
GROUP-4 peel and the roots peel into ONE total function: run the GROUP-4 extractor, and if the pair it
returns is not a genuine collision then the four outer slots agreed, so the two sub-blocks share a
digest and the roots peel is the collision.  So the reduction loses no tightness — the forger's
advantage is bounded by ONE collision finder's, not a sum of two. -/

/-! ## §4 — THE HEADLINE BINDINGS, with efficiency DISCHARGED. -/

/-- **⚑ THE FULL-STATE BINDING — the headline, at an arbitrary adversary class.** Under the deployed
sponge's collision floor, a forger of the wide full-state commitment whose extracted finder is in the
class has NEGLIGIBLE advantage: the runnable descriptor's published `state_commit` binds the whole
seventeen-field post-state — the twelve absorbed columns AND all eight side-table roots — except with
negligible probability.  `hEff` is the honest open obligation. -/

/-- **⚑⚑ THE FULL-STATE BINDING, DISCHARGED ON THE PROVED FLOOR — the exported anti-ghost claim of
the RUNNABLE descriptor.** The successor of the deleted `wideFullState_binds_from_polyTime` (floor
refuted, see `wideCommit_binds_rom`'s docstring). The bound domain `WideCols × SysRoots` — the whole
17-field post-state — is EXACTLY the shape `EffectVmRowCommitReduction.effectVmWideRomForgery`
transposes to the sampled oracle (three truncated state blocks plus the eight-root sub-block, the
inner digests re-absorbed by the outer query), so the successor is that chained binding: every
query-bounded forger of the whole nested post-state commitment has NEGLIGIBLE advantage. What
replaced the four `_or_collides` projections stays ONE binding — now with the floor PROVED
(`keyedRom_hard`, the birthday bound) instead of refutable. -/

/-- **THE ADVANTAGE INEQUALITY, UNCONDITIONAL — the adversary class does NOT appear.** Re-exported at
this site so the reduction's load-bearing step is visible here and not only in the spine: the wide
forger's advantage is at most the extracted collision finder's, at every parameter, over the same
sampled tag space.  `Eff` enters ONLY when the floor is applied. -/

/-! ## §5 — the floor PRICED at both poles, the inhabitation tooth, and the canaries. -/

/-- **⚑ THE ⊤ POLE — the floor is FALSE at the REAL BabyBear parameters** (the honest price of `hEff`).
A sponge whose output is a genuine BabyBear felt has finite range while `List ℤ` is infinite, so a
collision exists at every tag and the floor at the UNRESTRICTED class is FALSE.  What the rebuild buys
is not a floor the deployed sponge satisfies at ⊤ — no such floor exists — it is ONE named parameter
with both poles proved, in place of a disjunct that is unconditionally available. -/

evidence. -/

    HashCRHardQuant (spongeFamily D) (fun _ => False) :=
  carrierFloor_bot_vacuous D

/-- **(TOOTH — the class §4 instantiates at is NOT EMPTY.)** The constant finder is in
`IsPolyTime (spongeAnsSize D)`, so `Eff := IsPolyTime` is not `⊥` in disguise.  With
`CostAdversary.bruteForce_not_polyTime` (the ⊤-collapse witness PROVED excluded) this pins the
instantiated floor strictly between the two poles. -/

  carrierFloor_isPolyTime_inhabited D

/-- **(CANARY — the binding does NOT follow from the floor applied at ANOTHER finder.)** Strip the
reduction: try to conclude the wide forger's negligibility from the collision floor at some OTHER
adversary `B`, rather than the one EXTRACTED from it.  It does not go through — only
`wideFullState_adv_le` connects the two games.  This tooth REDS if a future edit collapses them. -/

/-- **(TOOTH — a REFLEXIVE answer is never a win, at ANY sponge.)** The game does not hand the
adversary a free win, so the negligibility above is not the negligibility of an unwinnable game's
advantage in disguise.  The computational twin of `EffectVmFullStateRunnable.wideColl_irrefl`. -/
