# Dregg2.Circuit.Emit.EmitStepMainJson — the `--run` emit driver for the `verify_one` assembly

Thin executable: writes each RUNG of the Lean-assembled `step_verifier.verify_one` circuit — and its
UNWIRED control — to `/tmp/pickles-stepmain/*.json`, which `pickles-stepmain-harness` proves +
verifies. Carries the `main` (kept OUT of `KimchiStepMain` so that module roots cleanly into
`PicklesSynthesis`).

    lake env lean --run Dregg2/Circuit/Emit/EmitStepMainJson.lean              # the committed shape
    DREGG_SM=smoke  lake env lean --run …                                      # the CI fixture shape
    DREGG_SM=A,C,E,M,I,B,D,V,P,W lake env lean --run …                         # an arbitrary shape
    DREGG_SM_RUNGS=r8_finalize lake env lean --run …                           # ONE rung
    DREGG_SM_RUNGS=all lake env lean --run …                                   # the nine (default)

⚑ **`DREGG_SM_RUNGS` is why a conformance re-grade is minutes and not a working day** (2026-08-03).
It used to matter twice over: `rungRows` bound all nine sub-lists BEFORE it matched on `k`, so every
rung evaluated the whole chain, and `emitRung` walks it twice more (wired, unwired). Nine rungs
therefore cost 9 × 2 FULL traversals, and the three gates that consume this driver
(`stepmain-shape-diff`, `curve-gate-oracle`, `stepmain-region-conformance`) grade `r8_finalize`
ALONE. Measured on the `step` shape from artifact mtimes: consecutive rungs landed 68–69 min apart
and the gap did NOT grow with the rung, though the rungs go 803 → 10 823 rows — the uniformity IS
the evidence that the work was shared and re-done.

⚑ **THAT HALF IS FIXED** (`KimchiStepMainCore.rungRows` is `rungOwn`/`rungsUpto` + a `foldl` over the
rungs at or below `k`, pinned by `rungRows_is_a_ladder`, by `rfl`), so a rung now pays only for its
own prefix and the nine-rung sweep costs about what `r9_opening` costs alone. The wired/unwired pair
is unchanged and is still the other factor of two (`DREGG_SM_WIRED_ONLY`). The full set stays the
default because §15's row-length pins want every rung.

The ten-field spec is `absorbs,chals,emsRows,msmTerms,ipaRounds,ipaBlocks,bRounds,cipEvals,tComms,
pubWords`. ⚑ `msmChunks` is GONE (2026-08-03): the MSM chunk count is per statement WORD
(`msmChunksAt`, §1b), so there is nothing shape-wide left to pass. ⚑ `tComms` is new since the R1 interleaving: `absorbs` is DERIVED from the
transcript schedule now (`absorbBlocksOf`), so sizing `t_comm` off `absorbs` would be circular.
The shape comes through the ENVIRONMENT, not `argv`: `lean --run` does not forward
trailing arguments through `lake env`, and a silently-ignored argument emitting the DEFAULT shape
under a scale-rung filename is exactly the measurement that lies.

Each rung reports its wall-clock split — chain evaluation, row scheduling, placement (`place`),
witness composition (`WitnessBuilder.compose`), render+write — because that split, not the prover,
is what governs whether the assembly reaches full `verify_one` scale.

House Law #1: the CIRCUIT is Lean-authored; `proof-systems` (the harness) is the Rust PROVER.

⚑ IMPORTS `…KimchiStepMainCore`, NOT THE UMBRELLA (2026-08-02, with the split). Every name this
driver uses — `mkStep`, `rungRows`, `stepGates`, `placedOf`, `stepWitness`, `rungProbeRows`,
`stepPublic`, `stepCircuit`, `Rung`, `shapeStep`/`shapeSmoke` — is §1–§11, i.e. Core, which
elaborates in ~11 s. The umbrella additionally pulls the thirteen PIN modules (837 `#guard`s,
~15 min of interpretation), and EMITTING a circuit does not depend on any of them. So the emit →
prove loop no longer waits on the pins. ⚠ This does NOT unroot a guard: `Dregg2.PicklesSynthesis`
(a `defaultTargets` root) imports the umbrella, so every pin module still runs in `lake build`.

harness carries a SELECTION, so the gate cannot infer "tracked" from "emitted": a rung this run
emitted that is absent here is not drift, and a rung that IS here and was emitted must match. Listing
them makes "which artifacts does this repo actually consume" answerable without a `ls`, and makes a
tracked file that has quietly disappeared a RED instead of a silently smaller grade. -/

/-- ⚑⚑ **"INSTALL WHAT YOU EMIT", AS A RED INSTEAD OF AS A COMMENT** — the STEP side's twin of
`EmitWrapMainJson.installedGate` and of `pickles_kimchi_marshal::installed_gate`, and it exists
because this route had **no refusal at all**.

`scripts/check-emitter-routing.sh:176` said so in as many words: the tracked
`stepmain_step_r8_finalize.json` is *"copied in BY HAND (no route to grade)"*, guarded only by
`pickles_kimchi_marshal`'s name/width refusal — which checks that the file is A step circuit of the
right arity, never that it is THIS assembly's. A stale step fixture is a perfectly provable circuit;
it is just not the one the Lean says, and every downstream number (the step proof,
`KimchiStepWrapChainFixture`, `WRAP_PUBLIC_INPUT_MEASURED`, slot 12 of the forty) is then about a
circuit that no longer exists in the tree.

**The gate is here rather than in a script for the reason the other two are inside their emitters:
it fires in the same process that produced the bytes, so re-emitting and not installing is the one
thing it cannot miss.**

`DREGG_SM_INSTALL=1` performs the copy instead of refusing. There is deliberately no switch that
disables the comparison, and a tracked file that is missing or unreadable counts as drift.

⚠ **A `DREGG_SM_WIRED_ONLY=1` RUN MAY NOT INSTALL.** It did not emit the `_unwired` twins, so
installing would leave a fresh wired artifact beside a stale control — the mixed-run directory
`emitRung` already refuses to create in `$DREGG_SM_OUT`, recreated in the tracked tree where it
would be worse. The tamper control is what makes "the tamper is REJECTED here and ACCEPTED on the
unwired twin" a real claim.

def OWN_PRECHAL_NAME : String := "stepmain_step_own_prechallenges.json"

/-- ⚑⚑ **THE ASSEMBLY'S OWN SIXTEEN, EMITTED SO THE WIRE CAN CARRY THEM — cells 60–75 of slot 12.**

`messages_for_next_step_proof.old_bulletproof_challenges` is `Vec<[Fp; 16]>` and is **never a
published statement word**: `MessagesForNextStepProof::to_fields` puts it in a Poseidon PREIMAGE and
only the digest reaches the forty (`prepared_statement.rs:123`). So there is nothing for the
marshaller to read out of the sixty-seven, and until now `prove_step` CHOSE the vector — a
`k·0x9E3779B97F4A7C15 | 1` ladder — while segment D absorbed `liftOf … (uChal k)`. Two vectors where
`step_verifier.ml:1114-1147` has one, and every per-slot instrument agreed with itself.

This file is the extraction. `raw` is `chalOf s d (uChal k)`, the 128-bit prechallenge the transcript
squeezes; `lift` is `liftOf s d (uChal k)`, its `to_field_checked` image, which IS segment D's
preimage cells 60–75. The marshaller reads `raw` into `step_pre`, endo-expands it with **Vesta's**
`endo_r` (`marshal::expand_step_prechallenge`) and REFUSES unless the result is `lift` — so the two
implementations of one lift are compared on every run instead of assumed equal.

⚠ **`raw` is emitted as well as `lift` because the wire carries the PRECHALLENGE, not its image.**
A `[u64; 2]` is what `PicklesBulletproofChallengeStableV1` holds; publishing the lift would hand Mina
a vector whose endo-expansion is a second lift of an already-lifted value.

⚑ **THIS DOES NOT DEPEND ON `G`, WHICH IS WHY THE FLAG DAY TERMINATES IN ONE PASS.** `chalOf` reads
the pass-2 transcript, whose only free input is `mkStepWith`'s `cipV` — computed in PASS 1 from
`sp0`/`ft0`/`defc0` and from nothing in `runBp`. So the sixteen are settled before `gXY` exists, the
accumulator over them is a constant, and segment D absorbing that constant cannot move them back. -/
