# EmitWrapMainJson — write the Lean-assembled `wrap_main` rungs as prover-ready JSON.

Clone of `EmitStepMainJson` for the WRAP side. Everything it writes is over **Fq** and is proved by
`metatheory/fixtures/pickles-wrapmain-harness` on **Pallas**, not Vesta.

⚠ THE SHAPE COMES THROUGH `DREGG_WM` IN THE ENVIRONMENT, NOT `argv`. `lean --run` does not forward
trailing args through `lake env`, and a silently-ignored argument that emits the default shape under
a scale-rung filename is exactly the measurement that lies.

    cd metatheory
    lake build Dregg2.Circuit.Emit.KimchiWrapMain
    DREGG_WM=wrap  lake env lean --run Dregg2/Circuit/Emit/EmitWrapMainJson.lean
    DREGG_WM=smoke lake env lean --run Dregg2/Circuit/Emit/EmitWrapMainJson.lean
    DREGG_WM=wrap DREGG_WM_OUT=/tmp/mine lake env lean --run …    # a lane's OWN directory

Files land in `$DREGG_WM_OUT/wrapmain_<tag>_<rung>{,_unwired}.json`, default
`/tmp/pickles-wrapmain/`. ⚑ `DREGG_WM_OUT` is the step side's `DREGG_SM_OUT` and exists for the same
reason: two revisions emitted for a byte-diff must not write to one path.

Then:

    cargo run --release --manifest-path metatheory/fixtures/pickles-wrapmain-harness/Cargo.toml \
      -- /tmp/pickles-wrapmain wrap

`writeAtomic` and its note apply verbatim here — a reader of the emit directory cannot tell a
complete artifact from one whose writer died mid-`String`, because both are a file with the right
name, and `rename(2)` within one directory is the only thing that makes the real name appear
carrying complete bytes. ⚑ This matters most to the byte-diff gate, whose whole job is to compare
these files against another revision's while an emitter may still be running. -/

/-- ⚑⚑ **"INSTALL WHAT YOU EMIT", AS A RED INSTEAD OF AS A COMMENT** — the wrap side's twin of
`pickles_kimchi_marshal::installed_gate`, and it exists because this route had **no refusal at
all**.

`scripts/check-emitter-routing.sh` said so in as many words: *"the thirty tracked
`wrapmain_smoke_*.json` are copied in BY HAND (no route to grade)"*. The `/tmp → fixtures/` hop is a
manual `cp` no script performs, so nothing anywhere compared the tracked bytes against what the Lean
currently emits, and the only stated grade was "the harness proves each rung" — which grades whatever
JSON is on disk, not whether that JSON is this assembly.

⚠ **AND IT HAD STOPPED BEING TRUE.** Measured 2026-08-09: the tracked thirty were last written at
`93bca7b7a` (08-08 07:28) and three later commits moved the wrap assembly under them — the last,
`0047cb876`, rewired `runIpa` onto §19d's fold. The harness had been proving a two-day-old circuit
and reporting green, because a stale fixture is a perfectly provable circuit; it is just not the one
the Lean says.

**The gate is here rather than in a script for the reason `installed_gate` is inside the marshaller:
it fires in the same process that produced the bytes, so re-emitting and not installing is the one
thing it cannot miss.** A gate that lives anywhere else can be skipped by not running it.

`DREGG_WM_INSTALL=1` performs the copy instead of refusing — one command that emits AND installs,
so "re-emit and install" stops being two steps with a human between them. There is deliberately **no
switch that disables the comparison**: a tracked file that is missing or unreadable counts as drift,
so a run from the wrong cwd reds rather than passing vacuously.

Returns the number of tracked files that differ. -/
