# Dregg2.Circuit.Emit.HeapLeafWideEmit — the WIDE heap leaf (felt-width #4/#10 LEAF SCHEMA),
Lean-authored AIR, additive.

## What this is (say the substrate out loud)

This is **Lean-authored AIR schema work**: the note-nullifier sorted tree's leaf widened so its
SORT KEY fields are full 8-felt digests. The deployed IMT leaf absorbs
`[addr, value, nextAddr]` with `addr`/`nextAddr` a SINGLE felt each
(`DeployedHeapTree.Heap8Scheme.heapLeafDigest8`, arity 3; emit sites
`EffectVmEmitHeapRoot.siteHeapAddr`/`siteHeapLeaf`, 1-felt addr) — so the KEY the pointer bracket
sorts on is ~31-bit, 2^15.5-collidable, while the tree's NODES are already the faithful 8-felt
`node8`. THIS file widens the leaf: `addr : Digest8` and `nextAddr : Digest8` (8 felts each),
leaf arity 3 → **17** (`addr8 ‖ value ‖ nextAddr8`), folded with the EXISTING
`Heap8Scheme.chipAbsorb8` carrier — the SAME single chip (`descriptor_ir2::chip_absorb_all_lanes`)
that serves `heapNodeOf8` (arity 16) and the narrow leaf (arity 3). No new hash is invented; the
input lists are length-disjoint (17 ∉ {3, 16}), so the chip's per-row `(arity, padded inputs)`
seeding separates the three domains for free, and the cross-domain theorems below make that
separation UNCONDITIONAL (a wide leaf equal to a node or to a narrow leaf IS a named chip
collision).

## Scope — what this lane does and does NOT do

  * **DONE HERE**: the widened leaf schema + digest (`heapLeafWideDigest8`), its absorb-block
    contract byte-pinned (`heapLeafWideDesc` + the marker-leaf pin), binding extracted as data
    (`…_binds_or_collides`, the §H.X discipline), the wide GENTIAN close through the DEPLOYED
    `node8` spine (`wideOpen8_binds_leaf_or_collides`), and the IMT pointer bracket
    `low.addr <_lex k <_lex low.nextAddr` at the LEX order with the exclusion keystone
    instantiated over the WIDE key (`wideBracket_excludes`), plus anti-masquerade teeth.
  * **DEFERRED (not this lane)**: the Rust `heap_root.rs`/`trace_rotated.rs` witness widening;
    the sorted-tree membership AIR wiring that instantiates the byte-pinned lex-compare block
    (`LexCompare8Emit.lexLt8Descriptor`) per bracket compare (that wiring is the follow-up
    LexCompare8Emit's own header names); and decisively the **ember-gated kernel flip**
    (`Dregg2/Exec/NullifierAccumulator.lean:12-23` — landing the wide roots into
    `RecordKernelState` extends the rest-hash/frame apex, a VK-epoch commitment change; NOT
    touched, NOT in scope, do not fire piecemeal).

## The soundness story (what transfers, what is new, what is named honestly)

The soundness side of #4/#10 transferred FREE: `Digest8KeySpike` machine-confirmed
`sorted_gap_excludes` at `Digest8Key := Lex (Fin 8 → ℤ)` and instantiated the deployed IMT
keystones (`imtAbsent_excludes_digest8` / `imtInsert_preserves_digest8` — the exclusion over the
wide key). The field-faithful in-circuit comparison is `LexCompare8Emit.lexLt8_refines`
(byte-pinned, boundary-canaried). THIS file supplies the remaining piece — the leaf schema whose
`addr`/`nextAddr` ARE genuine 8-felt keys — and states the bracket in EXACTLY the vocabulary both
of those close over: `toLex a < toLex b` on `Fin 8 → ℤ` (see `wideBracket_is_two_gadget_props` —
each bracket conjunct IS the RHS of `lexLt8_refines`, so the gadget instantiates per compare with
zero glue).

⚑ Honest local-tree note (the LexCompare8Emit precedent, repeated): `Digest8KeySpike.olean` and
`IndexedMerkleTree`'s import closure (`MapOpsColumnLayout.olean`) are absent from the local build
tree, so the key type is named STRUCTURALLY here — `Lex (Fin 8 → ℤ)`, the literal definition of
the spike's `Digest8Key` abbrev — and the exclusion keystone instantiated in-file is the deployed
`LinearOrder`-generic `NonMembership.sorted_gap_excludes` (the same generic object
`imtAbsent_excludes_digest8` instantiates at the IMT chain; the spike's §2 route). Nothing here
is a twin: `WideHeapLeaf` widens the SAME triple shape `heapLeafDigest8` absorbs, and the
exclusion is the SAME deployed lemma at the wide key.

## Anti-masquerade (the teeth this widening exists for)

Two leaves whose `addr` COLLIDE on lane 0 but differ in lanes 1..7:
  * are conflated by the NARROW schema at EVERY scheme (`narrow_schema_conflates` — the 1-felt
    leaf literally cannot state the difference; this is the disease, proved, not just named);
  * are DISTINCT wide keys (`twins_distinct_keys`), their difference is BRACKET-VISIBLE
    (`twinB_bracketed` — the lane-7-only twin lands strictly inside the pointer gap), the
    exclusion FIRES over the wide key (`lane0Twin_excluded`), and their wide DIGESTS differ at
    the deployed-shaped chip (the `#guard` pair) — equal wide digests would BE a named 17-block
    chip collision (`wide_twins_bind_or_collide`).

Heap safety: literal lists and small integers only; no `native_decide`; `decide` only on
`Fin 8`/small-ℤ literals. Axiom hygiene: `#assert_axioms ⊆ {propext, Classical.choice,
Quot.sound}` on every theorem below.

/-! ### §1.d — the schema contract, byte-pinned (`heapLeafWideDesc`).

There is deliberately NO standalone `EffectVmDescriptor2` here: the wide leaf is an absorb
SCHEMA riding the shared chip, and the gates that consume it (the splice `MapOp` + the per-bracket
`lexLt8` blocks) are the deferred sorted-tree wiring. What Rust's widened
`heap_root.rs::HeapLeaf::digest8` must byte-match is the absorb ORDER and OFFSETS — pinned twice:
the decodable schema record (repr-pinned) and the marker-leaf block value (order-pinned: any
offset swap or off-by-one flips the guard). -/
