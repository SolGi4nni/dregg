# Dregg2.Circuit.Emit.KeyCanonicity9Emit — `CanonicalKey9`, EMITTED.

## SUBSTRATE, SAID OUT LOUD

Lean-authored AIR. The constraints below are emitted from Lean; Rust re-reads the descriptor and
never hand-writes a gate, a lookup or an `air_accepts`.

## ⚑ READ `Dregg2.Circuit.KeyLanes9` FIRST — THIS FILE DOES NOT WRAP THE DEPLOYED ENCODER

The obvious task was "apply `FieldsCanonicity9Emit` to the owner-key octet". `KeyLanes9`
REFUTES that, with an exhibit: `eight_lane_canonicity_is_not_a_repair` produces two DISTINCT 32-byte
keys whose deployed octets are equal AND fully canonical (`canonical_32_to_felts_8` packs
`8+8+8+6 = 30` bits and drops bits 6-7 of every fourth byte). `keyCanonical8_iff_in_image` proves
`[0,2^30)^8` is EXACTLY that packer's image, so there is no missing leg to find and no stronger
eight-lane wrap to write. **A canonicity envelope on the deployed octet would force the columns into
the image of a map that is not injective on its domain** — a containment shipped while the real fix
is named as a later phase, which is the substitution this repo's own doctrine forbids.

So this file emits the envelope of the REPLACEMENT nine-lane encoder (`KeyLanes9.keyToLanes9`,
injective by a machine-checked left inverse), not of the deployed eight-lane one.

## The gadget — and there is no gadget

Per rotated block, NINE lookups and NOTHING ELSE:

```text
  lanes 0..7  < 2^29        -- eight lookups on the LANE table
  lane  8     < 2^24        -- ONE lookup, on a NARROWER table
```

Zero gates. Zero aux columns. Zero new hash sites. `KeyLanes9.canonicalKey9_iff_in_image` proves
those two legs are EXACTLY the image, so the wrap admits every honest key's nonet and no other
vector. The fields wrap needed seven aux columns, a cube gate and a doubled selector because its
lanes 0/1 were a `mod p` REDUCTION welded to the v1 face and therefore unmovable; the key octet is
welded to nothing (measured 2026-07-31: zero `colEq`, zero gate bodies, zero `pi_binding`s, zero
range lookups across all 117 rotated members), so the encoding was replaced wholesale and the
reduction — and with it `NoWrap`, the cube gate and the aux region — disappeared.

Two consequences worth stating because the fields wrap could not claim either:

  * **`keyCanon9_forces_canonical` needs no non-last-row hypothesis.** A `gate` is exempt on the last
    row until `hardenLastRow` lifts it; a `lookup` is not. Every leg here is a lookup.
  * **It needs no canonical-column envelope hypothesis either.** The fields forcing had to assume
    `0 ≤ col < p` for lanes 0/1 and the aux columns, because no lookup covered them. Here all NINE
    lanes are covered, so both bounds come from the emitted constraints themselves.

## ⚑ THE EXHIBIT, AND WHY LEG 2 IS NOT DECORATION

`forgedKeyNonet = [0,…,0,2^24]`. Every lane is below `2^29`, so the NAIVE wrap — nine lookups all at
the lane width, which is what "range-check the lanes" means to a reader who has not done the
arithmetic — accepts it. Its recomposed value is `2^24 · (2^29)^8 = 2^256` exactly: one full wrap of
the byte window, so the total decoder reads all thirty-two base-256 digits as zero and it decodes to
the ALL-ZERO key, byte for byte, while being a different committed vector.
`the_forged_nonet_passes_the_naive_wrap_and_is_unsat_here` bundles all three facts, and
`keyCanon9_rejects_the_forged_nonet` lifts the refusal to `¬ Satisfied2` over the emitted
constraints. The UNSAT is total: no assignment of anything else can rescue it, because the narrow
table simply does not contain the row.

## ⚑ WHAT RUNG THIS REACHES — say it exactly

**AUTHORED, PROVED, AND GEOMETRICALLY PLACED. NOT APPENDED TO ANY LIVE MEMBER'S CONSTRAINT LIST,
NOT RE-EMITTED INTO ANY DESCRIPTOR, AND NOT CONSUMED BY ANY VERIFIER.**

⚑ **CORRECTED 2026-08-01 (a) — the forcing and the capstone used to quantify over an arbitrary
`col : KeyColMap`.** Only lane 8's column was unknown; the other eight are `B_PUBKEY_OCTET` at stride
`B_SPAN`, which `deployedKeyCols` already recorded and four `#guard`s already knew. A theorem named
"determines the owner key" that quantifies over the column map determines whatever nine columns it
is handed — strictly weaker on the column axis than this file's own template
(`FieldsCanonicity9Emit.canon9_forces_canonical` takes a face width and reads the concrete
`laneColAt`), while the write-up presented the abstraction as scrupulousness. `§1.1` ties lanes 0..7
to the ABSORBED pre-limbs `wireCommitR` folds (`deployedKeyCols_octet_is_absorbed`). The old shape
was not merely unproved on that axis but REFUTABLE: with the block span free, `span := 0` put both
blocks' lanes on the BEFORE octet.

✅ **LANDED 2026-08-01 (b) — THE NINTH LANE NOW EXISTS.** `rotatedNumPreLimbs` went **184 → 187**
and `RotatedLayout.rotated187.octetNinthLanes = [184, 185, 186]` allocates one ninth lane per carrier
octet; the owner key's is in-block limb **186**. So `lane8Off` is no longer a parameter either:

  * `deployedKeyCanon9Cols w := deployedKeyCols w B_PUBKEY_NINTH_LANE` leaves nothing free but the
    face width, which genuinely differs member to member;
  * `deployed_nonet_is_absorbed` proves ALL NINE lanes are entries of `preLimbColsAt`, i.e. of the
    list `wireCommitR` folds into `state_commit`. An appendix column would have satisfied every
    other obligation here and bound nothing — `lane8_is_absorbed_iff` is that criterion as an IFF,
    and it was FALSE at every offset of the 184-limb geometry;
  * `keyCanon9_determines_the_owner_key_deployed` is the capstone stated against `preLimbsAt`
    entries rather than bare columns, so it is a sentence about what the consensus anchor binds;
  * `the_ninth_lane_offset_is_load_bearing` + `lane8_offset_plus_one_is_not_absorbed` are the
    mutation: **+1** lands on `B_IROOT` (not a pre-limb, so the lane leaves the absorbed region and
    the wrap would bind 232 bits while proving identically); **−1** lands on `contract_hash`'s ninth
    lane (an alias, which `Legal.disjoint` refuses).

**Why 187 and not 185.** `B_SPAN := n + 3 + (n − 4) / 3` is `Nat` FLOOR division while the real
carrier chain is `chunk31`'s `chunkCount`, which rounds UP. They agree exactly on `n ≡ 1 (mod 3)`.
At 185 the formula says 60 carriers where the chain needs 61 — the block is silently one column
short and every other `#guard` still passes. `EffectVmEmitRotationV3` now pins the formula against
the LITERAL `rotV3SitesAt` walk so that failure cannot be silent again.

**What this flag day breaks, and what must be redone.** Every `state_commit` moves, so this is a
**RE-GENESIS**: bump `persist`'s `CANONICAL_STATE_SCHEMA_EPOCH` (read the constant; do not
transcribe a remembered number) so a pre-flip image REFUSES TO LOAD rather than reinterpreting its
limbs. `B_IROOT` 184 → 187, `B_STATE_COMMIT` 185 → 188, the chain band `186..246` → `189..250`,
`B_SPAN` 247 → 251, `CAVEAT_REGION_OFF` 494 → 502, `CANON9_REGION_OFF` 539 → 547, `APPENDIX_SPAN`
651 → 659, appendix sites 136 → 138, `CUSTOM_COMMIT_TEETH_COL` 1791 → 1813. Re-emit every v3
descriptor, `layout_generated.rs`, the staged registry TSVs and every VK; re-pin every hand-carried
Rust literal in `trace_rotated.rs` / `exact_nullifier_aafi_rotated_trace.rs` /
`shielded_ring_clearing_air.rs` / `rotation_witness.rs` / `cell/src/commitment.rs`; add `29` to
`CUSTOM_RANGE_WIDTHS`; and write a Rust `key_limbs9` producer that FILLS limb 186 (and 184/185) —
without it every honest turn is UNSAT, and with an 8-lane packer behind it the wound is re-opened.

/-! ## §1 — the emitted columns. ⚑ `lane8Off` IS THE ONLY PARAMETER.

**This file used to quantify over an arbitrary `col : KeyColMap` everywhere, including in the
capstone, and that was strictly weaker than its own template.** `FieldsCanonicity9Emit` takes a face
width and reads the concrete `laneColAt`; here EIGHT of the nine columns are equally fixed and known
— `B_PUBKEY_OCTET` at stride `B_SPAN` — and a theorem named "determines the owner key" that
quantifies over the column map determines whatever nine columns it is handed. The abstraction was
justified by "lane 8's column does not exist", which is true of lane 8 and of nothing else.

So: `w` is the face width (exactly as the fields template takes it), `lane8Off` is the one genuinely
unallocated offset, and everything that claims anything about the OWNER KEY is stated at
`deployedKeyCols w lane8Off`. `KeyColMap` survives as the type of the column-agnostic PLUMBING in §2
and §3 (`blk_mem`, `lookup_forces`, the peel) — those name no key and claim none. -/

caller-supplied in-block offset that the geometry move must allocate as an absorbed PRE-LIMB (not an
appendix column: see the header, and `lane8_is_absorbed_iff` below for that as a theorem). -/

/-! ### ⚑ §1.1 — THE COLUMNS ARE THE ABSORBED OWNER-KEY LIMBS, from two sources that are not each
other.

Pinning the eight is not tidiness. `preLimbsAt` is the list `wireCommitR` folds into `state_commit`;
a column outside it is a free felt the anchor never sees, which is the whole reason the ninth lane
cannot ride the appendix. So "this wrap constrains the owner key" is exactly the claim that its
columns ARE entries of THAT list at the octet's position — a statement relating `deployedKeyCols`
here to `EffectVmEmitRotationV3.preLimbsAt` there, not a constant checked against its own def.

Before this section existed, no THEOREM in the file mentioned `B_PUBKEY_OCTET` — only the `def` and
four `#guard`s did — and the octet tie was not merely unproved but REFUTABLE: with the block span a
free parameter, taking `span := 0` collapses both blocks' lanes 0..7 onto the BEFORE octet. -/

/-- **THE TIE.** Lane `l < 8` of the wrapped nonet reads pre-limb `B_PUBKEY_OCTET + l` of the very

/-- ⚑ **WHERE THE NINTH LANE MAY LIVE — the criterion, as an IFF.** The ninth-lane column is
absorbed exactly when `lane8Off < rotatedNumPreLimbs`. Everything else is a free felt outside
`wireCommitR`, and in that case `state_commit` binds only the eight lanes — 232 bits of a 256-bit
key, which is the wound this wrap exists to close. At the 184-limb geometry NO offset satisfied it:
the pre-limb region was 184/184 occupied, so every choice was either an alias of a committed limb or
an appendix column. That is why the flag day had to move the EXTENT and not just add a lookup. -/

/-- ⚑⚑ **THE MUTATION, BOTH DIRECTIONS.** The ninth lane's offset is load-bearing to ±1, and it
fails in two DIFFERENT ways — which is why the allocation is a choice and not an accident.

  * `+1` is `B_IROOT` (`= rotatedNumPreLimbs = 187`), which is NOT a pre-limb. The nonet's ninth
    lane would sit outside `preLimbsAt`, `wireCommitR` would never fold it, and the emitted lookup
    would range-check a felt the anchor does not see — the wrap would look identical, prove
    identical, and bind 232 bits.
  * `−1` is `contract_hash`'s ninth lane (185). The pubkey nonet would ALIAS another octet's nonet,
    so two 32-byte carriers would share a committed column and neither would be injective. The
    layout's `disjoint` obligation is what refuses that, and `RotatedLayout.octetLaneCol_nodup`
    exhibits the 27 projected columns as pairwise distinct.

and the sentence the deployed eight-lane octet cannot reach at all

⚑ Two things this statement does that its predecessor did not. It names the columns instead of
quantifying over them, so it is a claim about the owner key rather than about whatever nine columns
a caller supplies. And it equates ℤ to ℤ rather than through `.toNat`, so a negative committed value

/-! ## §6 — ⚑ THE WIRE WRAP. The face the emit drivers apply, and the reason this file stopped
being decoration.

Everything above was true on 2026-08-01 and reached NOTHING: `keyCanonical9At` was applied by no
emitter, so not one committed descriptor carried a single range lookup on an owner-key lane, and
`state_commit` bound a nonet that no constraint required to be in the encoder's image. Measured
over the two committed registries at that HEAD: 10560 lookups on the 28-bit fields table, 960 on
the 24-bit table, and **zero on the 29-bit table** — the key nonet's lane width, which nothing had
ever emitted.

`keyCanonical9Wire` is the transform `EmitRotationV3.lean` (and the two wide registry probes) now
apply to EVERY rotated member, exactly as they already apply `ownerFreezeWire` and
`fieldsCanonical9Wire`. `faceWidthOfName` is shared from `FieldsCanonicity9Emit` — the Lean twin of
`trace_rotated::avail_pad_for_descriptor_name` — rather than re-spelled here, so the hardened
`…-v1-avail` members get their shifted base from the same single source `OwnerFreezeWire` reads.

**The wrap is geometry-invariant** (`traceWidth`, `piCount`, `tables`, `hashSites`, `ranges`, and
the member's NAME all `rfl`-unchanged): the nine columns are already allocated pre-limbs, and both
range widths ride width-tagged custom table ids the deployed IR-2 interpreter already realizes
(`descriptor_ir2::CUSTOM_RANGE_WIDTHS` carries 24 and 29). What DOES move is the main instance's
aux region — the interpreter appends `decomp_cols(29) = 9` limb columns per lane lookup and
`decomp_cols(24) = 6` for the narrow one, so `16·9 + 2·6 = 156` aux columns per member. That is a
descriptor re-emit and a VK rotation, not a schema move. -/
