# Dregg2.Circuit.Emit.KimchiCellCommit — the GROUP-4 COMMITMENT BINDING for route B

## ⚑ SAY THE SUBSTRATE OUT LOUD

This is **Lean-authored AIR**. Nothing below is hand-written: the four `hash_4_to_1` sub-circuits
are `KimchiPoseidon2.permGen` — a `def`-generator folded over the imported round constants, 141
S-boxes and not one of them spelled out — and the WIRING between them is `def`-generated from the
DEPLOYED site list (`EffectVmEmitIncrementNonce.incNonceHashSites`, which is
`EffectVmEmitTransfer.transferHashSites`) rather than restated. The o1js consumer transcribes the
emitted instruction stream and the Lean-computed witness; it authors no constraint and holds no
dregg semantics.

## THE GAP THIS CLOSES, in the words of the lane that named it

> The commitment binding is ABSENT. The 4 GROUP-4 hash sites are not emitted, so the circuit
> relates two bare 13-tuples and **does not prove they are the pre-image of any commitment** —
> i.e. that they are a dregg cell.

`KimchiEffectIncNonce` proves *these two 13-tuples stand in the `incrementNonceA` relation*. That
is a statement about arithmetic. This file adds the sentence that makes it a statement about a
**cell**: the after-state tuple is the pre-image, under the deployed `hash_4_to_1` tree, of the felt
sitting in the `state_commit` column — the same felt `boundaryLastPins` publishes as `NEW_COMMIT`
and `cell_state.rs::compute_commitment` computes.

## ⚑ AND THE SENTENCE IT STILL DOES NOT ADD

Route B is now a **cell-transition checker**. It is still **not a membership checker.** Even fully
bound, B says "this is a valid transition of a real, well-formed cell". It says **nothing whatever
about whether dregg's chain contains that cell or that transition.** A well-formed transition of a
cell that never existed satisfies every row below — invent a 13-tuple, hash it honestly, present
the pair. Membership is route A's job: A consumes a dregg proof and therefore inherits dregg's
accumulator and commitment structure (and its undischarged FRI/STARK floor). That asymmetry is the
honest core of route B and **nothing here narrows it.**

## The shape: TWO ARROWS, ONE `def`

  * **`cellCommitOf hash a`** (§2) is the one `def` — literally the right-hand side of the deployed
    forcing lemma `EffectVmEmitTransfer.transferHash_binds`: an `H4`-of-`H4` over the after-state
    block and the record-digest residue.
  * **ARROW TWO** — `babybear_forces_cellCommit`: the deployed BabyBear descriptor's hash layer
    (`siteHoldsAll hash env incNonceHashSites`) forces `cellCommitOf`. This is
    `transferHash_binds`, restated at the increment-nonce site list; nothing new is proved.
  * **ARROW ONE** — `kimchi_forces_cellCommit`: the EMITTED Kimchi rows, under the ONE named digest
    carrier, force the SAME `def`, at the same column.

⚑ **The asymmetry runs the same way it does for the arithmetic — the BabyBear side is again the
weaker one.** There, `siteHoldsAll` is an ASSUMPTION about the deployed TRACE: the descriptor
carries `VmHashSite`s whose denotation is "the digest column holds the hash of these inputs", and
no gate in `incrementNonceVmDescriptor.constraints` establishes it — the Poseidon2 chip is outside
the constraint list. Here `siteHoldsAll` is DERIVED (`commit_rows_force_siteHoldsAll`): the emitted
circuit CONTAINS the permutation, and what stays assumed is strictly narrower — `DigestCarrier`,
that a satisfying assignment of the emitted permutation sub-circuit puts `hash` of its input lanes
in its output lane. So the Kimchi emission again discharges more, and the residual is named in §9
rather than folded into a hypothesis that looks like a definition.

## ⚑ THE ONE UNDISCHARGED LEG, named precisely

`DigestCarrier` is `KimchiPoseidon2`'s own §5 remainder, quoted:

> `permGen_forces` — the composition all the way to "a satisfying assignment forces the output
> lanes to be `perm` of the input lanes" — is NOT proved here and is the first item of the named
> remainder.

It is not proved here either, and §9 says exactly what blocks it — it is not merely unproved: at
the emitted object two of `bbRange64`'s columns are unpinned and the reduction's remainder is
checked to 64 bits behind a `2^31` bound claim, so the statement needs those repaired before it
could even be true. **Nothing below assumes it away**; it is a hypothesis of every theorem that
needs it, and §6 shows it HOLDS at the honest cell so it demands nothing an honest instance does
not supply.

## Anti-vacuity, at birth (§6)

Over the ACTUAL emitted rows, evaluated: (a) every one of the 10,570 rows is satisfied by the
honest cell's witness — so nothing here is true for want of a satisfying assignment; (b) each site's
digest lane carries exactly `hash4to1Real` of the columns the DEPLOYED site absorbs, i.e.
`DigestCarrier hash4to1Real` HOLDS at the honest instance; (c) the last lane is exactly
`cellCommitOf hash4to1Real` of the honest cell — the emitted circuit computes the deployed cell
commitment, `841295468`, and the reference value comes from `hash4to1Real`, which the circuit never
sees. `tamper_non_preimage_refused` is the GENERAL refutation: **no assignment whatever** satisfies
the emitted circuit while carrying a `state_commit` that is not `cellCommitOf hash` of its own
after-state.

`incNonceHashSites` is what the running descriptor carries. Restating its columns here would make
this file a second opinion about the deployed layout, so the column lists below are COMPUTED from
it: `inColsGo` is `HashInput.resolve` lifted from VALUES to COLUMN INDICES, with a `.digest k` input
resolving to the column the `k`-th site's digest was pinned into. That substitution is exactly what
makes the emitted circuit read the same values `siteDigestsAcc` accumulates. -/

⚑ Note what its hypothesis IS: `siteHoldsAll` asserts, of the DEPLOYED trace, that the digest

One `hash_4_to_1` site is: range-check the four absorbed columns as BabyBear lanes, seed the
sixteen-lane Poseidon2 state `[x₀,x₁,x₂,x₃, 4, 0…0]` (`circuit/src/poseidon2.rs:349-362` — the
arity domain tag at position 4, capacity zero), run `KimchiPoseidon2.permGen`, and reduce output
lane 0 to its canonical representative. The digest is lane 0 of the permuted state, canonically —
which is precisely what the Rust returns. -/

/-! ### §3a — the honest cell, and its commitment.

`goodIncNonceRow` (the row `KimchiEffectIncNonce` proved the arithmetic accepts: bal 100→100, nonce
5→6) carries ZERO in all four digest columns, because the arithmetic emission never touched them.
The honest CELL row fills them with the genuine `hash_4_to_1` chain — computed by the deployed
`hash4to1Real`, which the circuit never sees, so §6's agreement between the two is a check and not
a tautology. -/

through four Poseidon2 permutations and the KERNEL reports "deep recursion detected". Measured, not
guessed. The fact is pinned instead by `costPinsHold`, which fixes `digestLaneVars` to the four
literal indices the emission produces and is checked through the compiler. Nothing rests on the
length: `pinGens` is a four-element literal over `digLane 0..3`, and a short list would only make
`digLane i` read `0` — a silly circuit the pin check catches, never an unsound one. -/

⚑ **WHERE THESE CHECKS RUN, and why it is not `#guard`.** The emitted object is 15,600
instructions, 76,489 witness values and 10,570 rows. `#guard` evaluates at ELABORATION time through
`whnf`, which builds the whole `List KRow` as an expression: measured, that took this module past
20 GB and was still climbing. So the computational checks live in **`CheckKimchiCellCommit.lean`**,
a `lake env lean --run` executable that evaluates the SAME `def`s through the compiler and **exits
nonzero** on any failure — and `EmitKimchiCellCommit` runs it before it will write an artifact, so
the JSON the o1js side consumes cannot be produced from an emission that fails one. The checks are
the `def`s below; the gate is `scripts/check-kimchi-cellcommit.sh`. This is a relocation of the
instrument, not a weakening of it: it can still go red, and it is the same predicate.

The cheap facts — the ones that do not touch the permutation — stay as `#guard`s here. -/

| the §3 PROJECTION it replaces | ~10,534 | `MINA-DREGG-SEMANTICS-NATIVE.md` |

**+0.6% against the projection**, and the projection was built from a MEASURED o1js marginal, so
the generated four-site tree prices essentially exactly where the hand-tuned estimate put it.
The commitment binding is **99.7%** of the emitted circuit (10,570 / 10,600) — slightly MORE
dominant than the 98.8% projected, because the arithmetic core came in at 30 rows rather than the
~127 the projection allowed for gates it does not emit.

**Effect rows per Pickles step: 6**, not the ~5 the projection gave (65,536 / 10,600 = 6.18; on the
usable ~55,000 after `zk_rows` and the wrapper it is 5.19, so "5 to 6" is the honest reading and 6
is the ceiling). The re-price does not move the geometry: a small turn is still one step.

The emitted gate mix is `Generic 6,154 · RangeCheck0 4,416` and **no other gate type** — every row
is one `KimchiTarget` MODELS, which is what `commitRows_all_modelled` proves and what keeps the
fail-closed `False` from discharging anything. -/

/-! ## §8 — THE EMITTED ARTIFACT.

The o1js consumer must not re-author anything, so it reads the instruction stream and the
Lean-computed witness. A `gen` op is `Gates.generic`'s five coefficients verbatim; an `rc0` op is
`Gates.rangeCheck0`'s value column plus its twelve limb/crumb columns. Coefficients are rendered as
DECIMAL STRINGS: the reduction's `p·2^{53i}` coefficients exceed 2⁵³ and a JSON number would
silently round them. -/

/-! ## §9 — WHAT REMAINS, precisely.

1. **`DigestCarrier` is undischarged**, and it is `KimchiPoseidon2`'s own first remainder. Closing
   it needs three repairs this file did not make, and the first two are DEFECTS of the emitted
   object rather than missing proof:
     * `bbRange64` allocates its two 12-bit COPY columns (`rc0CopyCols`, places 2⁷⁶/2⁶⁴) as fresh
       variables holding `0` and emits **no gate pinning them**, so the emitted `RangeCheck0`
       recomposition bounds its value by ~2⁸⁸, not 2⁶⁴. The fix is one shared pinned-zero variable
       and costs one sub-gate for the whole circuit.
     * `bbReduce`'s remainder carries a TRACKED bound of `2³¹` while the emitted check is the
       64-bit one. The `2³¹` is load-bearing: the S-box chain's Pasta safety is `35·2³¹ = 2³⁶·¹³`
       into `x⁷ < 2²⁵³·²`, and at a `2³²` lane it is `2²⁵⁹·⁹ > p_Pasta`. A genuine 31-bit check is
       two crumbs-only `RangeCheck0` rows plus a boolean sub-gate and costs rows.
     * The four 12-bit plookup columns are constrained by the lookup ARGUMENT, which `KimchiTarget`
       models as `False` and no forcing lemma may therefore assume. A real statement takes the
       lookup as a HYPOTHESIS, as `rc0PlookupCols`' own docstring says.
   Until then the carrier is a hypothesis, exhibited holding at the honest cell (§6) and nowhere
   assumed away.
2. **`transitionAll` is still unemitted** — 14 of the deployed descriptor's 35 constraints. Route B
   does not chain row to row: one valid, fully-bound cell transition is not a sequence, and a
   sequence of individually-valid rows is not a trace.
3. **The boundary PI pins are still unemitted** (7 of 35), so `state_commit` is not published as
   `NEW_COMMIT`. §5's warning stands even if they were: a public input the prover chose is not
   membership.
4. **The Lean forcing lemmas cover the rows this file emits, not the whole o1js circuit.** The o1js
   program adds `Poseidon.hash` for its claim binding and `Gadgets.rangeCheck32` for the envelope,
   and those rows are outside every theorem here — as are the `Lookup` gates `KimchiTarget` models
   as `False`. The argument that extra constraints cannot weaken soundness (they only shrink the
   satisfying set) is STATED, not proved.
5. **No freshness theorem for the emitted allocation.** Soundness needs none — each sub-gate forces
   its output from its inputs — but COMPLETENESS (that a witness exists for every honest cell) is
   exhibited at ONE cell, not proved for all.
6. **The field-accurate statement is ℤ.** §4 reads the emitted rows over ℤ. The deployed circuit
   runs over Pallas, and the step between them for the COMMITMENT rows is the integer-bound argument
   that `commitValsInPasta` only checks at the honest witness.
   `KimchiEffectIncNonce.kimchi_pallas_forces_intent` does that step for the ARITHMETIC rows; the
   commitment rows have no counterpart yet. ⚑ This is the one place the BabyBear/Kimchi asymmetry
   moves the OTHER way: the BabyBear hash layer is stated mod `p` and needs no bound argument at
   all, because it never emits the permutation.
