/-! ## §12 — the in-CI pins, on the SMOKE instance (`#guard`, interpreter-reduced).

The committed step-scale instance is emitted and PROVED by the harness; these pins run in `lake
build` and cover every structural property the harness cannot see.

⚠ **MEASURED 2026-08-02, and it CORRECTS what this banner used to say** ("nullary `def`s so the
interpreter evaluates the chains ONCE"): a nullary `def` is **not** cached across `#guard` COMMANDS.
`#guard` compiles and interprets its term afresh every time, so `tS`/`placedS`/`witS` are rebuilt
once per pin — **74** pins here (it said 77 against a measured 78; four decorations left on
2026-08-03), ~1.4 s each. Sharing happens only WITHIN one command. That is why the
pins are split across thirteen PARALLEL modules rather than batched into fewer commands: batching
buys the same factor and costs each pin its own failure site. -/

-- ── Structure ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- ⚑ RETIRED 2026-08-03: `blocks` was `absorbs + chals`. The permutation count is `tBlocks`, derived
-- from the lazy op tape, and it is SMALLER — see `…Pins18` for the equality that replaces this.
#guard placedS.length == totalRowsS
#guard placedUS.length == totalRowsS
#guard (placedS.map (fun g => g.wires.length)).all (· == 7)
#guard witS.length == 15
#guard (witS.map (·.length)).all (· == totalRowsS)

-- ⚑ THE PLACEMENT DID NOT REFUSE. `placeChecked` is the fail-closed door: `auxOverlapsPublic`
-- cannot fire (AUX = 67 ≥ pubWords), `referenceInGap` cannot (every circuit id is ≥ AUX), and
-- `inertPublicWord` is the LIVE gate — it fires unless the closing rows read all `pubWords` words.
#guard refusalOf pubS gatesS == none
#guard inertPublicWords pubS gatesS == []
-- …and it CAN refuse: declare a wider public input than the closing rows read and word `pubWords`
-- is reported inert rather than silently pinned (the `PRIMARY_LEN` 67-vs-40 shape, in miniature).
#guard match refusalOf (pubS + 3) gatesS with
       | some (.inertPublicWord i) => i == pubS | _ => false

-- ⚑ SEVEN GATE TYPES in one circuit — the census. Eleven `Poseidon` rows per sponge block, which
-- is upstream's own run length (`sponge_inputs.ml:47-64` / `plonk_constraint_system.ml:1450-1530`,
-- and MEASURED in Mina's `step-zkapp-proved` blob: every `Poseidon` run there is exactly 11).
-- FIVE sponges: R1's transcript sponge and R7's FOUR absorption segments. ⚑ The `+ 1` that used to
-- be here — §3c's `index_digest` as a permutation of its own — is GONE (2026-08-03): the copy's
-- squeeze IS segment C's block-27 permutation, so `idxDigestRows` emits nothing.
#guard (placedS.filter (fun g => g.kind == KGateType.poseidon)).length
        == 11 * (tBlocks shapeSmoke + tS.specA.blocks + tS.specB.blocks + tS.specC.blocks
                 + tS.specD.blocks)
-- ⚑ `2·chals + 5` `to_field_checked` chains, 8 `EndoMulScalar` rows each — and the composition of
-- that number IS the ledger of two retirements. Per transcript challenge TWO chains: the challenge
-- itself and `lowest_128_bits`' `assert_128_bits hi` (#1). Plus §8g's ξ (one, no split) and its r
-- (two: the challenge and its high part). Plus R8's own `lowest_128_bits` of the fr-sponge's FIRST
-- squeeze — TWO, because `Opt_sponge.squeeze_challenge` passes `~constrain_low_bits:true` and
-- `util.ml:98-99` then asserts BOTH parts. Upstream's own arithmetic, `squeeze_challenge` +
-- `squeeze_scalar`.
-- ⚑ **PLUS ONE, AND THE ODD ROW IS THE POINT (re-pinned 2026-08-03 by the lane `fad5c51a5` named).**
-- `c14a9cf01` swept this lane's in-flight rung into §23's commit and left the number at 168 against a
-- measured 169, correctly refusing to bank a half-landed gadget. The gadget landed: the 169th row is
-- `Branch_data.typ`'s `~assert_16_bits` (`per_proof_witness.ml:166-168`), which is
-- `to_field_checked ~num_bits:16` — 8 crumbs, **ONE** `EndoMulScalar` row. So 169 is not a chain
-- count and must not be: a total that went back to a multiple of `emsRows` would mean the 16-bit
-- range check on `domain_log2` is gone, and with it the pin that makes `(m₀, m₁, domain_log2)` a
-- function of `branch_data` rather than a choice. `RNG_DOMLOG2_ROWS` is named, not inlined.
-- ⚑ `#guard RNG_DOMLOG2_ROWS == 1` USED TO SIT BELOW THIS PIN AND IS DELETED (2026-08-03): the
-- constant is `def RNG_DOMLOG2_ROWS : Nat := 1`, so the guard was `1 == 1` with the name thrown
-- away. What CAN refuse is the pair below — the emitted census, and the non-divisibility that a
-- 16-bit chain gone back to a full 128-bit one would break.
#guard (placedS.filter (fun g => g.kind == KGateType.endoMulScalar)).length

#guard ((2 * shapeSmoke.chals + 5) * shapeSmoke.emsRows + RNG_DOMLOG2_ROWS) % shapeSmoke.emsRows != 0
-- …stated the other way, so a chain that vanished cannot hide inside the arithmetic: the range
-- chains are `chals + 3` of the total.

          (tS.defc.hi.getD 1 0) true).length == shapeSmoke.emsRows + 6
-- ⚑ …and R8's TWO, which is the third `lowest_128_bits` in the assembly. Stated as an EQUALITY on
-- the emitted sub-list: `finRows` is `aRows` + these two chains + three probes, so a deleted chain
-- moves this number rather than hiding behind another consumer of the same variable.

-- ⚑ THREE MORE DECORATIONS DELETED HERE (2026-08-03), with `RNG_DOMLOG2_ROWS == 1` above:
--     `#guard nRng shapeSmoke == shapeSmoke.chals + 5`
--     `#guard RNG_DOMLOG2 shapeSmoke == shapeSmoke.chals + N_DEFC + 2`
--     `#guard RNG_FIN_LO shapeSmoke == RNG_FIN_HI shapeSmoke + 1`
-- `nRng s := s.chals + N_DEFC + 3`, `RNG_DOMLOG2 s := s.chals + N_DEFC + 2`, `RNG_FIN_LO s :=
-- s.chals + N_DEFC + 1`, `RNG_FIN_HI s := s.chals + N_DEFC`, `N_DEFC := 2` — every one of those
-- three guards restated the body of its own `def` (the third, one `def` against its neighbour in the
-- same block). They read no emitted object, so there is no second source to disagree; each is `rfl`
-- with the name, the term and the axiom record deleted. `chals + 5` was the range-chain count as a
-- CLAIM, and the claim is made where it can refuse: the `EndoMulScalar` census above, and the
-- `rangeRows`/`finRows` lengths below, which are read off the emitted rows.
-- ⚑ `VarBaseMul` is R3's `multiscale_known` AND §6b's `ft_comm` — the second MSM runs at
-- `FTC_CHUNKS = 51`, `step_verifier.ml:240-242`'s uniform 255 bits, while R3's are PER STATEMENT
-- WORD (§1b) — `msmChunkPrefix`, not `msmTerms · a constant`.
-- ⚠ …AND §19's FOUR: `p_prime`'s `uc` and `rhs`'s three, all `scale_fast2 ~num_bits:255` hence
-- `FTC_CHUNKS` again. `rowsS` has been the `.opening` rung since §19.
-- ⚑ **GREEN, AND THE "RED AT HEAD" THAT USED TO CLOSE THIS NOTE WAS STALE THE COMMIT IT WAS WRITTEN
-- IN** (corrected 2026-08-03). §20 (`dca30f544`) landed `msmChunkPrefix` AND `N_SF * FTC_CHUNKS`
-- AND the "282 against an emitted 486" label in ONE commit, so the file has carried a red flag over
-- a line that already agreed with the emitter. ⚠ And **486 was never this line's number**: it is
-- `3 · 26 + 4 · 51 + 4 · 51`, the count at the OLD uniform MSM width, which §20's own per-word
-- widths (§1b) replaced — the emission moved to `153 + 204 + 204` in the same change.
-- ⚑ MEASURED OFF THE EMITTER, not off this line: `DREGG_SM=smoke DREGG_SM_RUNGS=r9_opening lake env
-- lean --run …/EmitStepMainJson.lean`, then `typ == 4` counted in
-- `/tmp/pickles-stepmain/stepmain_smoke_r9_opening.json` — **561**, wired and unwired alike.
-- ⚠ GRADE THIS PIN AGAINST `r9_opening`. `placedS` is `rungRows tS .opening`, and `r8_finalize` is a
-- DIFFERENT rung: it is missing §19's four ladders and reads 357, so grading the `.opening` census
-- by the finalize artifact manufactures a red of exactly `N_SF * FTC_CHUNKS`.
#guard (placedS.filter (fun g => g.kind == KGateType.varBaseMul)).length
        == msmChunkPrefix shapeSmoke.msmTerms
           + ftcTerms shapeSmoke * FTC_CHUNKS
           + N_SF * FTC_CHUNKS
-- ⚑ `EndoMul` is `ipaRounds` fold ladders PLUS ONE — `check_bulletproof`'s `Scalar_challenge.endo q
-- c` (`:326`), the consumer that makes `delta` and the last squeeze mean something.
#guard (placedS.filter (fun g => g.kind == KGateType.endoMul)).length
        == (shapeSmoke.ipaRounds + 1) * shapeSmoke.ipaBlocks
-- …and `CompleteAdd` is the two summation chains, R3's OWN `add_fast base base` per term (§12f,
-- new 2026-08-02) and §6b's: per `scale_fast2` the initial `add_fast base base` and the odd-branch
-- `add_fast h (negate g)` (`plonk_curve_ops.ml:157,267`), then `common.ml`'s own `tCommN + 1` adds.
-- ⚑ The fold chain is `ipaRounds` adds and not `ipaRounds − 1` since the `~init` wiring (`:606`),
-- and the tail adds three: `endo`'s two seed `add_fast`s and the closing `cq + delta` (`:327`).
-- ⚠ …and the tail is FOUR, not three: §19 added `p_prime = fold_sum + uc`'s own `Ops.add_fast`
-- (`Pins14.ipa_rung_grew_by_the_q_prime_add`). §19's own set adds `N_SF` `scale_fast2` seeds and
-- odd-branches (two each) plus the `G + b_u` and `rhs` adds.
-- ⚑ **GREEN** — the "35 against an emitted 46. RED AT HEAD" that used to close this note was the
-- same stale flag as the `VarBaseMul` one: `dca30f544` added the `+ 4` and the `+ 2 * N_SF + 2` and
-- the label together. `typ == 3` in `stepmain_smoke_r9_opening.json` is **46**, against this line's
-- `5 + 19 + 12 + 10`. (46 is the number the old note quoted, and it is right; 486 above was not.)

-- and `vZ bRounds` were each exposed twice at `pubWords = 67`.)
#guard (exposedVars shapeStep).length == shapeStep.pubWords
-- ⚠ ⚑ **THE COMMITTED SHAPE'S DISTINCTNESS PIN MOVED TO `KimchiStepStatementPins` (§24) AND IS NOW
-- A NAMED THEOREM.** `exposedVars shapeStep` is a `Types.Step.Statement` since §24, and its count is
-- ⚠ ⚑ 65 rather than 67 UNTIL 2026-08-07, and the reason given here was wrong. It read: "a STATED
-- divergence and not a collision: slots 4–7 are `zeta_to_srs_length` and `zeta_to_domain_size`, two
-- unconstrained words upstream that agree at `log2n = srs_length_log2` and ONE derived `ζ^n` cell
-- here." That cell was `ftcDiv2 1` — §6b's own **Fp** scalar, i.e. the WRAP statement's word 2/3 —
-- so it was an alias across two statements, and the wrap proof those slots are about sits at a
