-- ── ⚑⚑ §12j — **THE THREE CLOSURES, EACH WITH THE WITNESS ITS HOLE ADMITTED** ──────────────────
-- A wire without an exhibited alternative is unverified. For each of the three: the word was a
-- `msgVal` FIXTURE the sponge ate and no row read, so a prover could absorb one value and act on
-- another — and nothing in the assembly could tell. Each block below constructs the witness that
-- bought, shows the emitted gate polynomials ACCEPTING it in the shape that had no consumer, and
-- shows the new row REFUSING it.

-- ── (a) `sg_old[0]` — `combine_split_commitments`' `~init` (`step_verifier.ml:606`) ─────────────
#guard onCurveA sgAlt && sgAlt != Dregg2.Bridge.MinaStepPrevCommitments.SG_OLD0_XY

-- ⚑⚑ ACCEPTED BEFORE — with no row reading it, `sg_old[0]` sat in exactly ONE cell (the absorb row)
-- and the fold was self-consistent whatever it held. Now its class spans the sponge, the add and
-- `assert_on_curve`, which is the difference between absorbing a commitment and consuming one.
#guard (classCells posS (ipx shapeSmoke (qInit shapeSmoke))).length ≥ 4

-- (`snarky_curve.ml:212-229`). This file read the previous proof's commitments in as bare
