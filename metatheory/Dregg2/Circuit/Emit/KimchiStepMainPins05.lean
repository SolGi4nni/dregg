-- ── §12e — ⚑ `Common.ft_comm`'s MSM, AND `t_comm` STOPS BEING FREE (#5's head, retired) ────────
-- The previous rung derived `sponge_after_index` and left 45 of R1's 142 absorbed words free,
-- naming `t_comm`'s 14 as the ones that could only leave the list by being CONSUMED. §6b consumes
-- them, and everything below is stated on the EMITTED object rather than on the intention.

-- ⚑ THE SHAPE IS `common.ml`'s, counted. Eight `scale_fast2`s at `chunks_needed ~num_bits:254 = 51`
-- five-bit chunks (`plonk_curve_ops.ml:69-70,254-257`), and the `tCommN` cap does NOT bind at the
-- committed shape — so no quotient chunk silently stays a free witness there.
#guard tCommN shapeStep == N_TCOMM
#guard tCommN shapeStep == Dregg2.Bridge.MinaStepPrevCommitments.T_COMM_XY.length
#guard ftcTerms shapeStep == 8
#guard tCommN shapeSmoke == 3 && ftcTerms shapeSmoke == 4
#guard FTC_CHUNKS == (254 + 4) / 5 && 5 * FTC_CHUNKS == 255
-- …and it is a DIFFERENT width from R3's, which is exactly what #2's warning is about.
#guard FTC_CHUNKS != shapeSmoke.msmChunks

-- ⚑ THE ROW CENSUS, as an equality over its own sub-lists: the two `Shifted_value.Type2` splits,
-- `ftcTerms` ladders and `common.ml`'s add chain. A vanished sub-list moves this number.

-- ⚑⚑ **`t_comm`'s COORDINATES ARE THE TRANSCRIPT'S WORDS AND THE MSM's OPERANDS.** One σ class
-- spanning `Poseidon`, `assert_on_curve` and `VarBaseMul`. The Horner SEED `t_comm[n−1]` is term 1's
-- base, so its class is the whole ladder; a chunk that is only an ADDEND still has five cells.

-- ⚑ …AND THE CONTRAST THAT SAYS WHAT "FREE" MEANT. A surviving `vMsg` word's class is ONE cell —
-- the absorb row. That is the class every `t_comm` word was in before §6b: no row pins it, no
-- gadget reads it, and a `Poseidon` gate constrains the permutation and not what was fed to it.

#guard (ftcScaleTerm ftcSigma (tS.ftw.permVal + 1)).res != (tS.ftc.terms.getD 0 default).res
-- ⚠ ⚑ **AND SAY WHAT THAT DOES NOT DO.** An ON-CURVE substitution is REFUSED by no rung in this
-- assembly. It moves `ft_comm`, R4 round `FTC_ROUND`'s base, the fold and every downstream value —
-- and the check that would refuse it is the IPA opening, i.e. `verified`, which is simplification
-- #11 and is still a witnessed boolean. What §6b buys is narrower and is the thing that was
-- missing: `t_comm` is no longer a word the sponge eats and NOTHING reads. It is an
-- `Inner_curve.typ` value carrying a membership check, an operand of a sub-circuit, and a term in
-- the point R4 folds — so a grind on it is refused (below) instead of being invisible.

-- ⚑⚑ **THE FORMULA, AGAINST A GOLD o1-labs' OWN `SRS::verify` PINNED.** Everything above checks
-- the assembly against itself and against `PastaCurve`. This checks `common.ml:246-256` — the shape
-- §6b's row schedule implements — against the REAL block. `MinaWrapGroupGate` reproduces devnet
-- block 539508's `ft_comm` over the group law (`ftComm_reproduces_kimchi`) and o1-labs' `SRS::verify`
-- accepts the opening proof at that point. The transcription below is §6b's OWN order — seed at
-- `t_comm.(n−1)`, fold `t_comm.(i) + scale res zeta_to_srs_length` downto 0, then
-- `f_comm + chunked + negate (scale chunked zeta_to_domain_size)` — over `MinaWrapGroupGate`'s
-- projective primitives, at the block's own `perm` / ζ powers / commitments. It lands on the gold.
-- ⚠ AND IT SETTLES THE ζ QUESTION §6b names: at the real block the two ζ powers are DIFFERENT
-- (`max_poly_size = 2^15` against `domain_size = 2^14`), where this assembly's `log2n =
-- srs_length_log2 = 16` collapses them. That is a shape fact and it is why the two Horner scalars
-- share one `Shifted_value.Type2` pair HERE and would not THERE.
