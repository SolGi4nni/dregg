/-! ## §17 — `check_bulletproof`'s `rhs` and `equal_g`: WHAT IT WOULD REFUSE, AND WHAT IT WOULD NOT.

`step_verifier.ml:328-340`, verbatim:

    let rhs =
      with_label __LOC__ (fun () ->
          let b_u = scale_fast2 u advice.b in
          let z_1_g_plus_b_u = scale_fast2 (challenge_polynomial_commitment + b_u) z_1 in
          let z2_h = scale_fast2 (Inner_curve.constant (Lazy.force Generators.h)) z_2 in
          z_1_g_plus_b_u + z2_h )
    in
    (`Success (equal_g lhs rhs), challenges)

R4 already emits `lhs = Scalar_challenge.endo q c + delta` (`:325-327`, `lhsRows`). This section is
the OTHER side, evaluated on the assembly's own values — and the reason it is an EXHIBIT and not a
row-set is a MEASURED fact that inverts the reason the rung was queued.

## ⚑ THE FINDING: `equal_g` ALONE REFUSES NOTHING

`equal_g lhs rhs` is `Boolean.all (List.map2 Field.equal …)` (`:69-73`) — a two-coordinate equality
between `lhs = c·q + δ` and `rhs = z₁·(G + b·u) + z₂·H`, where

  * `q` is the fold of every consumed commitment, `c` the last transcript squeeze, `δ` an absorbed
    word — **all three bound** (R1/R4, and `assert_on_curve` on the supplied ones);
  * `b` is `advice.b`, a statement word (R8's `vBShift`) — **bound**;
  * `u = group_map (Sponge.squeeze_field sponge)` (`:263-266`) — **derivable**, and this section
    derives it (`gmapFp`), so it is a function of the transcript;
  * `H = Generators.h` — an `Inner_curve.constant`, **pinnable** (`GENERATORS_H`);
  * and `G = challenge_polynomial_commitment`, `z₁`, `z₂` — **FREE WITNESSES.** Read at source, `G`
    occurs at exactly two places in `step_verifier.ml` (`:253` destructure, `:333` use) and `z₁`/`z₂`
    at exactly two (`:253`, `:332-336`). No absorption, no pin, no statement word, no other consumer.

So for ANY `lhs` a prover sets `G := z₁⁻¹·(lhs − z₂·H) − b·u` — one scalar-field inverse and three
scalar multiplications, **no discrete log** — and `equal_g` holds. `bpExhibit` below measures exactly
that on the assembly's own numbers: the honest witness closes, the on-curve-substituted assembly with
the SAME `G` is REFUSED, and the same substitution with `G` RE-SOLVED is ACCEPTED again.

⚠ **So the previous rung's note — "`equal_g` is the first rung that can refuse an on-curve
substitution" — is FALSE as stated, and this is where it is measured.** What `equal_g` buys is that
`verified` (#11) stops being a free boolean and becomes a function of `(q, c, δ, b, u, G, z₁, z₂)`.
What it does NOT buy is any refusal, because the last three of those are the prover's.

## ⚑ WHAT WOULD REFUSE IT, NAMED AT SOURCE

`G`'s binder exists and it is **one rung ABOVE `verify_one`**: `step_main.ml:526-545` hashes
`acc.wrap_proof.opening.challenge_polynomial_commitment` — this very `G`, one per previous proof —
into `hash_messages_for_next_step_proof`, whose digest is the step statement's
`messages_for_next_step_proof` (`step_main.ml:571-575`), a PUBLIC output. With that assembled, a
re-solved `G` moves a public word and the public-vector tie refuses it; `z₁`/`z₂` alone then leave a
two-dimensional discrete log in `⟨G + b·u, H⟩`, which is the IPA opening's own hardness and not a
gate. Without it, `equal_g` is satisfiable for every `lhs`.

⚠ **AND THAT HASH IS NOT SEGMENT C.** §8e's segment C is the OTHER call —
`hash_messages_for_next_step_proof_opt` inside `verify_one` (`step_main.ml:59-81`), over
`prev_challenge_polynomial_commitments` (= `sg_old`) and `prev_challenges`, masked by
`branch_data.proofs_verified_mask`.

## ⚑ WHAT LANDED 2026-08-02, AND THE TWO PLACES THIS SECTION WAS WRONG AT SOURCE

**(1) Segment C's commitment slots are corrected**, and §12k exhibits it in both directions. The
slots were R3's x_hat sum and R4's fold output `q` — neither is `sg_old`. ⚠ This section said the
second half "needs `sg_old[1]`, the `Wrap_hack.Checked.pad_commitments` second slot", i.e. a variable
this assembly did not have. **It did have it.** `sg_old[1]` is census commitment 1, which is fold
ROUND 0's base (`ipx/ipy (qT s 0)`) because round `r` folds commitment `r+1` — the correction was a
FOUR-word swap with no new variable at all.

**(2) The two vectors are INTERLEAVED PER PROOF**, which neither this section nor `hmSpec` had:
`to_field_elements_without_index` (`composition_types.ml:595-607`) is
`Array.concat [app_state; Vector.map2 comms chals ~f:(fun c ch -> g c ++ ch)]`, so the order is
`comm₀ · chals₀ · comm₁ · chals₁`, not four coordinates followed by every challenge. §12k pins that
the concatenated order over the SAME four correct words gives a DIFFERENT digest, so the layout was
load-bearing on its own.

**(3) The outer hash IS assembled** — segment D, `hmOutSpec`, a `Sponge.copy` of `sponge_after_index`
(`step_verifier.ml:1164`) absorbing the app state, `G`, and `finalize_other_proof`'s returned
`bulletproof_challenges`, with its squeeze exposed as public word 7. `G` now has an
`assert_on_curve` and an absorption where it had **no occurrence at all**.

## ⚑⚑ AND THE VERDICT ON THE SUBSTITUTION, RE-RUN BELOW WITH `G` BOUND — READ IT BEFORE QUOTING

**The substituted-with-re-solved-`G` witness is STILL ACCEPTED.** `bpCloses` is unchanged and it is
still `true`; nothing in this file refuses it, and binding `G` to a public digest did not make it
refuse. What changed is measurable and it is smaller than a refusal:

  * `G` was a witness with **zero occurrences** — any on-curve point sat in it, and no constraint and
    no public word moved. It is now absorbed, so **a re-solved `G` MOVES public word 7**, exhibited
    below at the honest and at the re-solved commitment.
  * That is a refusal only for a consumer that **compares** `messages_for_next_step_proof` against
    what it expects — which is the next step's `verify_one`, through the very inner hash segment C
    reconstructs and the wrap-proof tie at `step_main.ml:83-86,108`. **One recursion step later.**
    This circuit alone still accepts; it just no longer proves the honest statement.
    ⚠ ⚑ **AND THAT CONSUMER IS NOW BUILT — §18 — AND IT IS NOT A REFUSAL EITHER.** The sentence
    above says "that is a refusal only for a consumer that compares"; §18 builds the comparison and
    the substituted chain CLOSES, because the prover carries the fake `G` forward as `sg_old` and the
    reconstruction reproduces the moved word. Read §18 before quoting this bullet as a deferral.
  * The prover who is willing to move that public word is not refused here at all. `equal_g` is not
    emitted, so **no row in this assembly relates `G` to the opening** — segment D binds `G` to the
    STATEMENT, not to the IPA.

⚠ So the answer to "is the previous proof's commitment bound now" is: **bound to the statement, not
to the opening, and the opening is not checked here.** And with `G` fixed, `z₁`/`z₂` still leave a
two-dimensional discrete log in `⟨G + b·u, H⟩` — the IPA opening's own hardness, an ASSUMPTION and
not a gate.

## THE UNDONE ROW-SET, PRICED

Three `scale_fast2`s at `~num_bits:255` (`:240-242`) = 3 × 51 chunks, reusing §6b's `ftcScaleTerm`
and its `Shifted_value.Type2` split rows; two `Ops.add_fast`s; one `Inner_curve.constant` pin for
`H`; `group_map` as ~13 double-`Generic` rows (`potential_xs` is 6 multiplications and one inverse,
then three `sqrt_flagged` at 3 constraints each, `Boolean.Assert.any`, and the first-of-three
selection); and `equal_g` as two `Field.equal` plus one `Boolean.all`.
≈ **373 rows** (`assert_on_curve` on `G` left this list — segment D needed it and it is emitted).
