# Dregg2.Circuit.Emit.KimchiTyp — a PUBLIC-INPUT LAYOUT DERIVED FROM A TYPE

## ⚑ WHAT THIS REPLACES

`KimchiPreimageCircuit` hand-wrote `preimagePublic : List Int` and hand-chose that the one public
word sits at `external 0`. `MinaWrapPublicInput.publicInputWords` is a hand-written slot list.
`PicklesRecursion.wrapStatementLayout : List (String × Nat)` is a hand-written census of names and
widths. **Nothing in the tree derived a layout from a type, and nothing refused a wrong one.**

The bug that costs the most is the one that shape cannot see. `MinaWrapPublicInput.lean:187-195`
records it in its own words: *"Slots 5-7 used to read `alpha, beta, gamma`. `Wrap.Statement.to_data`
(`composition_types.ml:826-880`) lays the `challenge` bucket down before the `scalar_challenge` one,
so they are **`beta, gamma, alpha`**."* (Slot 8, ζ, did not move.) And on the instruments: *"the
round trip in §3 is definitional … `publicInputWords_reads_every_field` is permutation-blind by
construction, and all three are 128-bit challenges so the width signature cannot separate them."*
The emitted object was right by luck of the transcript's squeeze order.

The sibling, from `KimchiWrapMainPins09.lean:216-218`: *"twenty exposed words carried the 255-bit
endo lift where `spec.ml:374-392` packs the raw 128-bit prechallenge, and the only word with a
different width was the only correct one, which is why nothing caught it."* — so "the outlier is the
bug" pointed at the one slot that was right.

## ⚑ WHAT MAKES THOSE IMPOSSIBLE HERE, AND WHAT DOES NOT

A layout that is *recorded* beside the emission repeats the bug in a new place. So there is exactly
**one** order in this file, and every consumer reads it off the same recursion:

    layout t          the slots, in emitted order, with their widths
    store t x         the field elements, in the SAME order
    read  t xs        the inverse, in the SAME order
    claims t base     the arena claims, in the SAME order

`layout`/`store`/`read`/`claims` are four recursions over one `Typ` constructor list. There is no
second place to disagree with. §4's `only_the_derived_layout_is_accepted` is the theorem that a
declaration which is not *literally* the derived layout is REFUSED — not "different", refused.

⚑ And §6 makes the reordering **derived rather than authored**: `structOf` takes the fields in the
**record's** order, each tagged with its `to_data` bucket, and computes the emitted order. The
author of `plonkFields` writes `alpha, beta, gamma, zeta` — the OCaml record's order — and the
layout comes out `beta, gamma, alpha, zeta`. Nobody writes the emitted order at all, which is why
nobody can write it wrong.

⚠ **Where the type stops carrying the width, say so.** `Typ.word w` denotes `Fin (2 ^ w)`: a raw
128-bit prechallenge and a 255-bit endo lift are *different types*, so substituting one for the
other does not typecheck, and if it is declared it is refused by width. `Typ.felt w` denotes `Nat` —
the host's canonical representative, whose range is the field's business (`PastaField`) and not the
layout's. `felt` buys the layout check only, **not** the type check. Slots that carry a challenge
must use `word`; §8's preimage digest uses `felt` because its canonicity is a fact about
`PastaPoseidon.Ref.perm` that nothing in this file proves.

## ⚑ THE CIRCUIT IS STILL A VALUE

`El` is a `Typ → Type` recursion and every operation is a pure fold; there is no `Typ` monad, no
`run`, no runtime configuration. `KimchiArena`'s note applies verbatim — a state monad would put the
layout behind a `run` and `decide` does not reach through one usefully. The array combinator is
`Typ.arr`, which **derives** an iterated product rather than adding a function-typed constructor, so
`decide` computes through an array layout the same way it computes through a pair. The `Fin n`
indexing is still there: `arrOfFn` / `arrGet`, with `arrGet_arrOfFn` as the law.

## ⚑ WHAT THIS DOES NOT DO

It does not know what a field element *is*, it does not constrain a value, and it emits no row. It
decides which slot a value occupies and how wide that slot is, and it refuses a declaration that
disagrees. The gate that the emitted circuit READS every public word is `KimchiPlacement`'s H2; the
gate that two slots never share a variable is `KimchiArena.alloc_injective`; §5 hands this layer's
slots to that allocator and §5's `derived_layouts_always_allocate` proves the handoff never refuses.

  a `word 255` and no coercion relates them.

⚑ `arr` is a `def` on `Typ`, not a constructor: an `n`-element array IS an `n`-fold product whose
elements carry `idx` tags. Nothing about `store`/`read`/`layout` changes, `decide` computes through
an array exactly as it computes through a pair, and the round trip in §3 covers arrays without a
single extra case. The `Fin n` interface is `arrOfFn`/`arrGet` and its law is `arrGet_arrOfFn`. -/

refusal — a path that is not a leaf of the type resolves to `none`, an UNWIRED cell, and a public
word no gate wires is what `KimchiPlacement`'s H2 (`inertPublicWord`) already refuses. A misspelled
wire therefore cannot reach an artifact, and it needs no new check to stop it. -/

/-! ## §7 — ⚑ CLOSING `publicWordDemoted`'s RESIDUAL AT THE ALLOCATOR.

`KimchiAssertEqual`'s §8 refuses a merge that demotes a public word, and its docblock names the
reason: *"`varIx` interleaves the two namespaces (`internal n ↦ 2n+1`), so an `internal` id below
the public range CAN outrank a public word."* That is a hazard **only because ids were hand-picked**.
A `Typ`-driven interface fixes the public words at `external 0 .. pubSize-1` and can reserve the low
ids on the aux side too; this section proves that when it does, the refusal cannot fire. -/

/-! ### §7a — the merge that BINDS a public word, which `endpointsAbove` cannot cover.

`preimageMerges` is `(external 0, internal 2)`: the public word IS an endpoint, so §7's hypothesis
is false by construction and its theorems say nothing. What is true there — generally, with no
hypothesis at all — is that a class root never OUTRANKS its member. That is enough to place the only
possible demotion inside the range the allocator reserves. -/

/-- ⚑ **SO THE ONLY DEMOTION THE ALLOCATOR CANNOT RULE OUT LANDS INSIDE THE RANGE IT RESERVES.**
Whatever the merge list, `rootVar ms (external i)` is an `external j` with `j ≤ i` or an
`internal j` with `j < i` — both strictly inside `0 .. pubSize-1` on their own side. Under the aux
floor no circuit variable lives there, so a demotion cannot be TO a variable the circuit uses; the
first case with `j < i` is two public words in one class, which `placeCheckedMerged` refuses ahead
of the demotion check as `publicWordsAliased`.

⚠ **AND HERE IS WHAT IS STILL OPEN.** This does not prove the root IS `external i`. Closing that
needs the union-find's root-is-class-minimum property, which `KimchiAssertEqual` §2 states as a
maintained invariant and does not prove — it is that file's obligation, not this layer's, and its
`publicWordDemoted` check is the decidable stand-in that still runs on every emission. What the
allocator owns is closed: §7's aux-only case outright, and the mixed case narrowed to the reserved
range. -/
theorem the_demotion_root_is_inside_the_reserved_range (i : Nat) (ms : Merges) :
    (∃ j, j ≤ i ∧ rootVar ms (.external i) = .external j)
      ∨ (∃ j, j < i ∧ rootVar ms (.external i) = .internal j) := by
