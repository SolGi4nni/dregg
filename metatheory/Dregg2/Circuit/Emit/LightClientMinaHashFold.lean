# Dregg2.Circuit.Emit.LightClientMinaHashFold — folding out the Mina POSEIDON linkage carrier
`LINK_OK`, and the canonicality carrier `CANON_OK`: the state-hash chain binding becomes DERIVED by
an in-circuit Poseidon chain plus a Lean-authored width gate, not two trusted witnessed bits.

⚑ SUBSTRATE, SAID OUT LOUD (House Law #1). The ONE AIR object in this file — `minaRowWidthGates` —
is **LEAN-AUTHORED**: a `def`-generator over `AirBuilder.Head`, produced from `AirBuilder.rangeNonneg`
via `StakeWidthRange.widthGate`, with a FORCING lemma (`minaRowWidthGates_forces`) stated over the
EMITTED constraint list. No Rust hand-writes it; Rust only calls the decision. No new hash arithmetic
is authored either: the Poseidon primitive is `MinaStateQuery.poseidonPair`'s sponge
(`PastaPoseidon.Ref.hash`, o1js-`Poseidon.hash`-exact and KAT-pinned there), and this file only
CHAINS it.

## The fifth chain

`LightClientEthFinFold` / `LightClientEthExecFold` (SHA-256 branch), `LightClientTmHashFold` +
`LightClientSolHashFold` (SHA-256 collection chain) and `LightClientMidHashFold` (BLAKE2b absorb)
fold out the hash carriers of four chains. Mina was the missing fifth. Its rules are
`Dregg2.Bridge.LightClientMina`; this file is its fold, at POSEIDON over Pasta `Fp` — the hash Mina
actually uses, and the one whose defect is *different* from SHA-256's and BLAKE2b's.

## The carriers being folded out (the POSEIDON carriers — NOT the PICKLES carrier)

`LightClientMina.minaVerify` carries three witnessed projections. Two are Poseidon-side:

  * `LINK_OK` = `linkOk L ts u` — the exhibited segment is PARENT-LINKED and height-contiguous from
    the pinned weak-subjectivity anchor: block `i+1`'s `previousStateHash` IS block `i`'s computed
    state hash. In the carrier posture a verifier TRUSTS a bit for this and re-runs no Poseidon.
  * `CANON_OK` = `canonOk L u` — every state-row field element is canonical (`< p`).

This file replaces both. `LINK_OK` becomes the Poseidon CHAIN `stateChain`, whose TERMINAL VALUE IS
THE TIP STATE HASH — so a satisfying witness must EXHIBIT the block headers whose Poseidon chain from
the anchor lands on the tip the settlement is claimed under. `CANON_OK` becomes `minaRowWidthGates`,
the emitted 254-bit width check.

The third carrier — `PICKLES_OK`, the per-block Kimchi/Pickles Wrap-proof result — STAYS a carrier
(the IPA/FRI arc, shared with the whole Mina lane; NOT this file). ⚑ But it is not left dangling
either: §6 DISCHARGES it on a REAL Mina devnet block, from `MinaRealBlockGate.real_block_accepts`.

## Why the canonicality gate is not optional here (the Poseidon-specific defect)

SHA-256 and BLAKE2b read a message WORD modulo `2^64`, which is why the Solana stake and the Midnight
weight needed 64-bit width gates. Poseidon is worse in a different direction: `Ref.absorbAt` enters
every input through `(state + x) % p`, so the sponge cannot distinguish `x` from `x + p` AT ALL — a
one-line structural collision, not a birthday event (`MinaStateQuery.poseidonPair_shift_collides`,
which is why that file's `PoseidonPairCR` was deleted as FALSE). Applied to a light client this is an
ANCHOR SUBSTITUTION: a segment presented under anchor `A + p` chains to exactly the same tip state
hash as one under `A` (`stateChain_anchor_shift_collides`, §4 — proved structurally, no permutation
evaluated). The 254-bit width gate closes it, and the closure is exact rather than approximate:
`p > 2^254` (`pow254_lt_pN`), so `< 2^254` ⟹ canonical, and the whole `+k·p` alias family collapses
to a point in range (`mina_alias_collapses_in_range`).

## The ties proved here (mirroring the four chains' fold theorems)

  * `foldStateHash_eq_poseidonRow` — the bridge leaf's abstract `stateHash` IS the generator's
    Poseidon row hash (the `*_eq_chainCommit` / `reconstruct_*_eq_foldReconstruct` analog).
  * `stateChain_eq_tip` — the chain's terminal value IS the tip state hash the light client tracks
    (the object `LINK_OK` stood for, via the Poseidon arithmetic, not a bit).
  * `stateChain_binding_of_noColl` — at the PER-INSTANCE non-equivocation side condition
    (`NoChainColl`, the shape `MinaStateQuery` repaired to on 2026-07-27), two segments chaining from
    their anchors to the SAME tip state hash have the SAME anchor and ARE the same segment. This is
    the NON-EQUIVOCATION content: a forger cannot open one tip to two histories.
  * `minaRowWidthGates` / `minaRowWidthGates_forces` — the emitted canonicality AIR and its bite.
  * `canonOk_from_gate` (`verify*_from_fold` analog) — the `CANON_OK` boolean is DISCHARGED by the
    emitted gate: no carrier column is read.
  * `mina_link_from_fold_gate_accepts` — carrier-free on the Poseidon side: the fold-derived linkage
    and canonicality DISCHARGE `minaVerify`, with only `PICKLES_OK` left as a carrier.
  * `mina_segment_binding_on` — the payoff, at the honest floor.

## The floor's THREE legs (SATISFIABLE / REFUTABLE / NOT PROVABLE), because two is not a floor

  * SATISFIABLE — `noChainColl_self` (the honest prover's own segment against itself), with NO
    hypothesis and no hash evaluated.
  * STRENGTH-PRESERVING — `noChainColl_of_no_collision` recovers the per-instance condition from the
    old global-injectivity hypothesis in one step, so nothing the deleted floor would have bought is
    lost.
  * LOAD-BEARING and REACHABLE — `stateChain_binding_unconditional_false` refutes the conclusion
    without the condition, and `rowColl_reachable` shows its negation is reachable AT THE DEPLOYED
    HASH. Both come from the `+p` shift, structurally.

## DERIVED vs TRUSTED, per step (say it at the current resolution)

  * DERIVED here: the Poseidon chain reconstruction and its `rfl`-tie to `stateHash`; the segment
    binding, reduced to the per-instance step condition; the canonicality carrier, from an EMITTED
    gate with a forcing lemma; the discharge of `minaVerify`'s two Poseidon conjuncts.
  * TRUSTED (named, load-bearing): (1) RESIDUAL #1, the composition wall — `stateChain anchor rows =
    tip` is, in a deployed circuit, the CONCLUSION of chained Poseidon gates forcing their sponge
    outputs; the per-node Poseidon forcing (`PastaPoseidon` §7 residual #3) is NOT discharged here or
    anywhere, so the fold is an explicit hypothesis and DERIVED-vs-ASSUMED stays visible.
    (2) RESIDUAL #2, the state-hash preimage shape — real Mina hashes the protocol state under
    domain prefixes (`Hash_prefix`), over a much wider field list than the four-field row here; the
    row captures the LINKAGE structure, not the byte-exact protocol-state serialization.
    (3) RESIDUAL #3, `PICKLES_OK` — the Kimchi/IPA arc, a carrier, inheriting the undischarged
    FRI/IPA floor even where §6 discharges it on a real block.
    (4) RESIDUAL #4, FORK CHOICE — this file binds an ANCHORED SEGMENT; it does not follow a chain.
    ⚑ NARROWED 2026-07-29: the rule is no longer absent — `Dregg2.Bridge.MinaChainSelection`
    implements Samasika `select` against `proof_of_stake.ml` and differentials it against openmina
    on 57 real-state vectors. The residual is now exactly the WIRING (nothing calls it) plus the
    fact that `select` is a TOURNAMENT with proved 3-cycles, so "the canonical chain" is not a
    function of a candidate SET.

## Axiom hygiene

`#assert_axioms` ⊆ {propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}; no `sorry`/`admit`/`native_decide`. The
Poseidon primitive is anchored in `MinaStateQuery` §9 against the pinned `mina-poseidon` crate and
the o1js probe gold; this file adds no hash arithmetic and its KATs are structural + discrimination
(`#guard`, interpreter). The two REAL devnet state hashes pinned in §5 are Base58Check decodes with
verified checksums — the decode procedure is spelled out so `bridge/src/mina_observer.rs` can and
does reproduce them.

/-! ## §0 — The POSEIDON state-hash chain generator (the `chainCommit` analog, at Poseidon).

A Mina block's protocol-state hash commits its parent's state hash together with the block's own
fields, so the "collection chain" of a Mina light client is the BLOCK CHAIN ITSELF: fold the block
rows through the state hash from the anchor, and the terminal value is the TIP STATE HASH. Built
ONLY from `PastaPoseidon.Ref.hash` — no new hash arithmetic. -/

/-- A block ROW as the state hash sees it, minus the parent (which is the fold accumulator):
`(blockchainLength, stagedLedgerHash, publicInputDigest)`. -/
abbrev MinaRow : Type := Nat × Nat × Nat

/-- **The protocol-state hash**, as a fold step: `Poseidon(parent, height, ledgerHash, piDigest)`.
The 4-element input is `Ref.hash`, the same o1js-exact sponge `poseidonPair` is the 2-element case
of. (RESIDUAL #2: real Mina packs a much wider protocol state under `Hash_prefix` domain tags; this
is the linkage structure, not the byte-exact preimage.) -/
def poseidonRow (parent : Nat) (r : MinaRow) : Nat := Ref.hash [parent, r.1, r.2.1, r.2.2]

/-- The row hash IS the sponge on the 4-limb input (definitional). -/
theorem poseidonRow_eq_hash (parent : Nat) (r : MinaRow) :
    poseidonRow parent r = Ref.hash [parent, r.1, r.2.1, r.2.2] := rfl

/-- **THE POSEIDON STATE-HASH CHAIN.** Fold the exhibited block rows through the state hash from the
anchor; the terminal value is the TIP STATE HASH. This is what `LINK_OK` stood for. -/
def stateChain (acc : Nat) (rows : List MinaRow) : Nat := rows.foldl poseidonRow acc

/-- The empty segment chains to the anchor itself.

(Proved by `simp` on `List.foldl`, NOT by `rfl`: a `rfl` here asks the kernel to whnf through
`poseidonRow`, i.e. through the whole Poseidon round-constant table, and it blows the recursion
limit. The `simp` form never unfolds the hash — which is also the honest reading, since these are
laws of the FOLD, not of Poseidon.) -/

/-! ## §1 — The per-instance NON-EQUIVOCATION floor (the shape `MinaStateQuery` repaired to).

⚑ NOT a global-injectivity `Prop`. `Ref.absorbAt` reduces every input mod `pN`, so injectivity of the
concrete Poseidon is FALSE by a one-line shift — `MinaStateQuery` deleted exactly that floor on
2026-07-27 after every payoff under it turned out to be `False → anything`. This file adopts the
repaired shape from the start: a side condition at exactly the steps the induction consumes. -/

/-- **A genuine EQUIVOCATION of the state-hash step** — two DISTINCT `(parent, row)` inputs with the
SAME state hash. Carries its own distinctness, so `¬ RowColl` is never satisfied vacuously. -/
def RowColl (a : Nat) (r₁ : MinaRow) (b : Nat) (r₂ : MinaRow) : Prop :=
  ¬ (a = b ∧ r₁ = r₂) ∧ poseidonRow a r₁ = poseidonRow b r₂

/-- **`NoChainColl`** — the per-instance side condition: at EVERY level of the two chains, walked in
lockstep from their anchors, the state-hash step inputs are not an equivocation. The length equality
is carried by the definition itself (the mismatched shapes are `False`). -/

      ¬ RowColl a r₁ b r₂ ∧ NoChainColl (poseidonRow a r₁) t₁ (poseidonRow b r₂) t₂
  | _, _, _, _ => False

/-- **THE SEGMENT COMMIT BINDS, at the per-instance floor.** Two segments whose Poseidon state-hash
chains reach the SAME tip state hash have the SAME anchor and ARE the same segment — provided the two
histories do not equivocate the state hash at any level. This is the NON-EQUIVOCATION content
`LINK_OK` stood for: an attacker cannot open one tip state hash to two different block histories
without exhibiting a Poseidon collision at a specific height, which the side condition denies at that
height and nowhere else. -/

bought, the side condition buys in one application. (And it shows the condition is satisfiable
between segments that genuinely DIFFER, not only in the self case where the conclusion is free.) -/

/-- **THE ANCHOR IS NOT PINNED BY THE TIP** (without the width gate). A segment presented under
anchor `A + p` chains to EXACTLY the same tip state hash as one under `A`, because the sponge enters
its first input through `(state + x) % p`. For a light client this is an ANCHOR SUBSTITUTION: the
governance-pinned weak-subjectivity anchor does not, by itself, pin the history. -/

/-! ## §3 — THE CANONICALITY WIDTH GATE: Lean-authored AIR that closes the `+p` family.

`pN > 2^254` (`pow254_lt_pN`), so a 254-bit width gate forces CANONICALITY exactly: a field element
the gate admits is `< 2^254 < p`, and the whole `+k·p` alias family collapses to a point. -/

Both are Base58Check decodes of the strings `MinaRealBlockGate` names, performed as Mina does it:
strip the 4-byte double-SHA-256 checksum (VERIFIED), strip the `0x10` state-hash version byte, strip
the `0x01` bin_prot version byte, read the remaining 32 bytes LITTLE-ENDIAN as an `Fp` element. The
same decode is performed in `bridge/src/mina_observer.rs::decode_state_hash`, whose test pins these
exact decimals — so the Rust decoder and this file are cross-checked against each other on real
chain data. -/

/-! ## §6 — THE PICKLES CARRIER, DISCHARGED ON A REAL MINA BLOCK.

`MinaStateQuery` §10 residual #6 says, correctly, that K5's Kimchi decision and the Poseidon fold
"share no object in Lean". That is still true of the STATE-QUERY seam. It is NO LONGER true of the
LIGHT-CLIENT seam: below, `minaVerifyDecision`'s `PICKLES_OK` projection is supplied by
`MinaRealBlockGate.real_block_accepts` — the composed decision over devnet block 539508, whose Wrap
proof openmina's `BlockVerifier` + o1-labs' `kimchi::verifier::verify` accept.

⚑ WHAT THIS IS AND IS NOT. It IS: the light-client decision accepting with its proof carrier
rendered by the real block's Kimchi arithmetic rather than by a hypothesis or a `true` literal. It is
NOT: a discharge of the IPA/FRI floor (that floor is untouched and is `picklesSound`'s content), NOT
a claim that the tracked segment is the one Samasika selects, and NOT the K6 state-query seam. -/

/-- **THE MINA LIGHT-CLIENT DECISION ACCEPTS, WITH ITS PICKLES CARRIER SUPPLIED BY A REAL DEVNET
BLOCK.** The Kimchi decision term below is verbatim `MinaRealBlockGate.real_block_accepts`'s subject.

the depth arithmetic, `minaVerifyDecision` accepts. -/
