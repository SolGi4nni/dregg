# `Dregg2.Circuit.Emit.LightClientMinaLinkAir` — the Mina exhibited SEGMENT, multi-row, compiled.

⚑ SUBSTRATE, SAID OUT LOUD (House Law #1): this is a Lean-authored AIR. `minaLinkDesc` is
`EffectLower.lowerAir` applied to the `EffectAir` source `minaLinkAir` (§3). There is **no
hand-written `VmConstraint2` in this file.** Rust only reads the emitted bytes.

## What this rung is, and — first — what it is NOT

`LightClientMinaAir` publishes three carriers. `CANON_OK` stopped being a witness on 2026-08-03.
`LINK_OK` and `PICKLES_OK` did not. This file takes the FIRST HALF of `LINK_OK` and no more, and the
split is the whole point of the file, so it is stated before the construction:

`LightClientMina.chainLinked` (`Bridge/LightClientMina.lean:202`) is three conjuncts per block:

    (i)   h.parent  =  prev                       -- the running state hash IS this block's parent
    (ii)  h.height  =  ph + 1                     -- height contiguity
    (iii) prev'     :=  blockHash L h             -- and the running value is Poseidon(stateRow h)

⚑ **(i) and (ii) are equality and addition. (iii) is Mina's Poseidon over Pasta `Fp`.** This file
derives (i) and (ii) — over nine-lane `Fp` columns, multi-row, one row per exhibited block — and
derives the SEGMENT LENGTH besides.

⚑⚑ **AND SINCE 2026-08-06 IT DERIVES (iii) TOO — by RECURSION, not by a bigger circuit.** Every row
carries a `proofBind` whose commitment is `salt ‖ PARENT ‖ BODYHASH ‖ OWNHASH`, fifty-four
`Faithful9` lanes, against the pinned fingerprint of `dregg-pasta-fp-absorb::v1`. `OWNHASH` is the
IMAGE of its row, at the recursion boundary every `proofBind` in this tree stands at
(`seam_derives_the_own_hash`, §6). The predicate `linkShapeAccepts` keeps its name because what a
ROW-LOCAL predicate can see of a seam is still only its shape.

## ⚑ Why (iii) was called a wall, and what re-deriving the price found — 2026-08-06

This header used to read: *"a Pasta multiplication at BabyBear is ~10³ constraints; one
Poseidon-over-Pasta permutation is ~500 of them, so ~5·10⁵ BabyBear constraints per block hash, and
a Samasika-depth segment is ~1.5·10⁸ for the linkage hash alone."* Both factors were wrong, in the
same direction, and the second by 26×.

⚑ **THE PERMUTATION COUNT IS 1 PER BLOCK.** `Bridge/MinaStateHashDerive.lean:31` reads the daemon
(`protocol_state.ml:45-55`):

    state_hash = Poseidon_Fp( salt "MinaProtoState" )[ previous_state_hash ; state_body_hash ]

TWO field elements at rate 2 is ONE block and ONE permutation, and the salt is a CONSTANT permuted
at emit time. The `~26 permutations a block` the standing estimate carried is the *transcript*
chain's link count (27 in phase 1, 46 in phase 2), not the state hash. The deep hash is
`state_body_hash` — and it is not part of the LINKAGE: it enters as a witnessed nonet whose
attestation is `PICKLES_OPENING_WITNESSED` (⚑ `PICKLES_WITNESSED` until 2026-08-06), exactly as
before.

⚑ **AND THE CIRCUIT DID NOT NEED BUILDING.** `dregg-pasta-fp-absorb::v1` is emitted, fingerprinted
and PROVES: 2 048 rows × 469 columns, 858 constraints, whose 660 ROM immediates are `fp_kimchi`'s
own `static_params()` checked on the emitted bytes. It computes `perm(state + [x₀,x₁,0])`, its
incoming state is a PUBLIC INPUT rather than a descriptor constant, and
`MinaWrapVerifierSpongeFp.the_absorb_program_permutes_gen` carries **no hypothesis on that state** —
so a *salted* sponge is the same descriptor with different public inputs, which is what
`MinaPhase1Chain` already does for 27 links. Re-derived segment cost at that family's measured
leaf/fold times (9.5 s a leaf, 11.5 s a fold node): 290 leaves + 289 folds ≈ **1 h 41 min** against
the inherited **44 h**. ⚠ An extrapolation from a same-shaped descriptor, not a measured 290-leaf
run, and labelled as one.

⚑ **NOTHING NON-NATIVE IS AUTHORED HERE.** The Pasta cone whose emitted form is unsound
(`pastaLimbRange` emitted nowhere, the RCB carry columns not boolean-pinned) is untouched:
`minaLinkDesc` still contains no multiplication of two distinct witness columns anywhere
(`minaLink_products_are_only_the_real_bit`, §3b). The multiply lives in the BOUND SUB-PROOF, whose
program identity is pinned lane by lane.

## ⚑ What `dregg-turn-chain-binding-v2` actually contributed — the transfer, measured

`EffectVmEmitTurnChainBinding` is a multi-row binding descriptor with a per-row leaf and a recursion
tree, and its shape transfers ALMOST WHOLE. Site by site
(`Dregg2/Circuit/Emit/EffectVmEmitTurnChainBinding.lean`):

    turn-chain site                          this file                              Pasta mul?

    perRowHash         (:129)   acc=Poseidon2(acc,…)        ⚠ NOT TRANSFERRED — see below
    ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

⚑ **The finding, and it corrects the survey that opened this lane.** The survey said "swap 'turn' for
'Mina block' and it is an emit-and-wire job." That is RIGHT about the chaining and it buys less than
it sounds, because **`dregg-turn-chain-binding-v2` never computes the values it chains.** Its
`old_root`/`new_root` are field elements chained by EQUALITY (`rootContinuity` is `loc c1 − nxt c0`,
one subtraction); its one hash site is a *native BabyBear* Poseidon2 accumulator over the row
(`acc_out = Poseidon2([acc_in, old_root, new_root, idx])`), which digests the chain but does not
produce it. So turn-chain-binding transfers COMPLETELY for the equality/counting half and contributes
**nothing at all** to the hash half — it has no hash half to contribute. The blocker was never that
the descriptor was single-row; single-row was the blocker for (i)/(ii), and this file removes it.
(iii) was never in the donor.

`perRowHash` is deliberately not transferred: a native accumulator here would digest the chain into
one felt, which is a *convenience* for a recursion seam and not a binding, and this file has no
recursion seam to feed yet. Adding it would be a column that computes something nobody reads.

## ⚑ THE TOOTH THIS ACTUALLY CLOSES: `SEG_LEN` stops being a free felt

`LightClientMinaAir`'s §"THE TOOTH" says the published `blockchain_length` is DERIVED, not witnessed:

    G1   BLOCK_LEN = ANCHOR_H + SEG_LEN

and concludes *"a prover that exhibits `n` blocks above the pinned anchor can publish exactly
`anchorH + n`."* ⚠ **That conclusion does not hold of that descriptor, and the reason is structural:
`SEG_LEN` is column 0, a free witness, and the descriptor is SINGLE-ROW — it has no exhibited
blocks.** The only thing constraining `SEG_LEN` there is `segSlackC` (`SEG_SLACK + 1 = SEG_LEN`) with
`SEG_SLACK` ranged into `[0, 2^24)`, so `SEG_LEN` is free in `[1, 2^24]` and `BLOCK_LEN` with it.
`minaLcAir_no_forgery` is honest about this in the only place it can be — `hsl : a SEG_LEN =
u.blocks.length` is a HYPOTHESIS, discharged by the witness generator, not by a gate. The docblock's
sentence is stronger than the theorem beneath it.

Here `SEG_LEN` is `REAL_COUNT` on the last row (`lastRealCountBind`'s analog), and `REAL_COUNT`
accumulates `IS_REAL` across rows that are `0/1`-pinned and monotone. A prover claiming a
290-deep segment must commit a trace carrying 290 real rows, each with nine canonical `PARENT` lanes
and nine canonical `OWNHASH` lanes that chain into its neighbour and a height that ticks.
`link_seg_len_counts_the_real_rows` is that as a theorem. **That is the depth evidence
`LightClientMina.mina_depth_is_witnessed` claims and the single-row descriptor could not deliver.**

## ⚑ THE COUPLING: the canonicality rung is what makes this linkage EXACT

An emitted gate forces its body `≡ 0 [ZMOD P]`, not `= 0`. So `OWNHASH[i] ≡ PARENT[i+1]` alone
admits a `+P` alias per lane — nine independent aliasing lanes, one addition each. The linkage is an
EXACT equality only because every lane is range-gated below `2^29 < P` by the same `.limbs` /
narrow-lookup gadget `LightClientMinaAir` §1a landed, which this file IMPORTS rather than copies
(`laneCanon`, `stateValue`, `mina_lane_canon_forces_canonical`). `link_lane_equality_is_exact` is the
statement; `linkAccepts_forces_exact_lane_chain` is where it is used. **Two rungs, one gadget.**

## Layout — one row per exhibited block

    col 0..8    PARENT[j]    the block's `previousStateHash`, nine base-`2^29` `Faithful9` lanes
    col 9..17   OWNHASH[j]   the block's OWN protocol-state hash, nine lanes.  ⚑ DERIVED — §6
    col 18      HEIGHT       `blockchainLength`
    col 19      IS_REAL      1 on an exhibited block, 0 on padding; real rows are a PREFIX
    col 20      REAL_COUNT   cumulative `IS_REAL`
    col 21      ANCHOR_H     the pinned anchor's height (read on the first row only)
    col 22..30  BODYHASH[j]  ⚑ the block's `state_body_hash`, nine lanes — the PREIMAGE
    col 31..39  HASH_VK[i]   ⚑ the attested state-hash program's nine fingerprint lanes

    PI 0..8     PI_ANCHOR[j] the operator-pinned weak-subjectivity anchor state hash
    PI 9..17    PI_TIP[j]    the verified head's state hash
    PI 18       PI_ANCHOR_H  the pinned anchor's height
    PI 19       PI_SEG_LEN   ⚑ the number of EXHIBITED blocks — now `REAL_COUNT` on the last row

Widths: lanes 0..7 at **29** bits (the last wrap-free width at BabyBear,
`RangeFieldContainment.wrap_free_iff_le_29`) and lane 8 at **22**, so `8·29 + 22 = 254` and
`2^254 < p_Pasta` exactly as in the sibling rung. Nothing here declares a width ≥ 30; the compiler
refuses one structurally (`LimbsLeg.mainRailOk`).

## Both polarities, on the emitted object

* ACCEPT — `honest_segment_accepted`: a three-block segment on the REAL devnet genesis anchor,
  chaining to a real tip, heights contiguous, `PI_SEG_LEN = 3`.
* REFUSE — `broken_link_refused`: the SAME segment with block 2's `PARENT` lane 0 bumped by one.
  Every canonicality lookup still passes (it is a canonical lane), every height still ticks, every
  carrier bit is whatever the prover likes — and the descriptor refuses it, because
  `OWNHASH[1] ≠ PARENT[2]`. ⚑ This is the forgery `LightClientMinaAir`'s witnessed `LINK_OK = 1`
  waves through, exhibited as a row pair rather than asserted.
  `broken_link_old_admits_new_rejects` states the pair.
* REFUSE — `short_segment_refused`: `PI_SEG_LEN` claimed 290 against three exhibited real rows.
  The free-depth liar.

## ⚑ WHAT THIS BREAKS (flag day, stated so it is findable)

**2026-08-06 — THE STATE-HASH SEAM. Say what re-emits, and what refuses rather than reinterprets.**

* `dregg-mina-lightclient-link::v1` **re-emits**: `trace_width` **22 → 40** (nine `BODYHASH`, nine
  `HASH_VK`), constraints **53 → 72** (eight body-lane lookups, one body top-lane lookup, nine
  program-lane lookups, one `proof_bind`), legs **39 → 43**. **`piCount` STAYS 20** and no PI slot
  moves — nothing new is published; a seam names columns, not public inputs. **Its VK rotates.**
* ⚠ A witness generator that leaves `HASH_VK 0..8` unfilled now produces an **UNSAT row**: the
  `vkPin` congruence is an emitted constraint, so a pre-flag-day 22-wide trace does not "verify
  weakly", it **fails to load** — `prove_vm_descriptor2` refuses a trace of the wrong width outright.
* `dregg-mina-lightclient-verify::v1` **re-emits and re-VKs**, because `LightClientMinaAir.LINK_VK_LANES`
  is the link descriptor's fingerprint and that moved. Same coupling `CHAINLINK_VK_LANES` already
  carries. **Every previously produced `MinaHeadProofWire` fails to verify.**
* `mina_head_predicate_vk()` is blake3 over the descriptor NAME, which did not move, so cell
  programs keep their pinned predicate vk and **nothing re-genesises.**
* `pasta-fp-absorb.json` is **unchanged** — it is the sub-program, not a new one — but it must join
  the by-name registry to be servable, and re-emitting it would move `ABSORB_VK_LANES` and cascade
  through both descriptors above. Three descriptors, one chain.

⚠ `circuit/descriptors/PROVENANCE.json` is already UNSTAMPED from the 2026-08-03 flag day and
`check-descriptor-drift.sh` is already RED; this adds a row to that ledger and the stamp remains the
operator's ceremony.

**2026-08-08 — THE FLAG DAY THIS RUNG DID *NOT* TAKE ON 08-07, TAKEN. `piCount` 20 → 37.**

`MinaStateBodyHashChain` derived `state_body_hash` on 08-07 and folded it, and nothing in this
descriptor related `BODYHASH` to that chain's root — because a `proofBind`'s `commit`/`vk` name
PUBLISHED values and these nine columns were read, joined and NOT PI-bound
(`LightClientAnchorConnectivity.minaLink_body_hash_is_joined_but_not_published`, whose third
conjunct is now REFUTED: `the_unpublished_body_hash_claim_is_now_refuted`). What landed:

* `BODYHASH 0..8` are **published** at PI slots 20..28, and the body-hash chain's **8-lane ordered
  transcript accumulator** at 29..36. `piCount` **20 → 37**. A recursion fold reads
  `air_public_targets`, so the weld to the chain's root is now REACHABLE — which is exactly what the
  unpublished shape forbade.
* ⚑ **THE SEAM BINDS THE ABSORBED STREAM, NOT `(salt, BODYHASH)`.** §2c's `bodyChainBindLeg`
  commits to `salt("MinaProtoStateBody") ‖ BODYHASH ‖ acc` — 27 constant lanes, 9 body-hash lanes,
  **8 accumulator lanes** — against `dregg-pasta-fp-chainlink::v1`'s fingerprint. The vacuity was
  named before it could be built: *"a bind of `(salt, BODYHASH)` alone would be VACUOUS … `perm` is
  a permutation, so 25 links from a fixed head with free absorbed inputs reach every field element.
  Naming the stream is the whole content."* `minaLink_body_chain_seam_binds_the_stream` pins the 44.

**WHAT RE-EMITS, WHAT RE-VKs, AND WHAT NOW REFUSES RATHER THAN REINTERPRETS:**

* `dregg-mina-lightclient-link::v1` **re-emits**: `trace_width` **40 → 57** (eight `BODY_ACC`, nine
  `CHAIN_VK`), `piCount` **20 → 37**, constraints **72 → 99** (nine program-lane lookups, one
  `proof_bind`, seventeen pins), legs **43 → 62**. **Its VK rotates.**
* ⚠ **THE OLD SHAPE FAILS TO LOAD, IT DOES NOT VERIFY WEAKLY.** `prove_vm_descriptor2` refuses a
  trace whose row width is not the descriptor's (`"base row width {} must equal descriptor
  trace_width {}"`) and refuses a public-input vector of the wrong length (`"public input count {}
  != descriptor public_input_count {}"`). A pre-flag-day 40-wide trace with 20 PIs hits BOTH. There
  is no path on which it is reinterpreted.
* `dregg-mina-lightclient-verify::v1` **re-emits and re-VKs**, because `LightClientMinaAir.
  LINK_VK_LANES` is this descriptor's fingerprint and that moved. **Every previously produced
  `MinaHeadProofWire` fails to verify.**
* `mina_head_predicate_vk()` is blake3 over the descriptor NAME, which did not move, so cell
  programs keep their pinned predicate vk and **nothing re-genesises.**
* `pasta-fp-chainlink.json` is **unchanged** — it is the bound sub-program, not a new one — and
  `FP_CHAINLINK_VK_LANES` is its fingerprint transcribed. Re-emitting IT would move that literal and
  cascade through both descriptors above. Four descriptors, one chain.
* ⚠ **RUST CONSUMERS THAT MUST MOVE WITH IT**, named so the break is findable rather than absent:
  `circuit-prove/tests/mina_link_segment_multirow.rs` (builds 40-wide rows and 20-PI vectors),
  `circuit/tests/mina_statehash_seam_proves.rs` (`proofBindsOf` is now TWO seams, not one),
  `circuit/tests/mina_transcript_carrier_binding.rs` (`LEAN_SEGMENT_VK_LANES` is the moved
  fingerprint) and `turn/src/executor/mina_head_verifier.rs`'s `MINA_LINK_DESCRIPTOR` path.

⚠ `circuit/descriptors/PROVENANCE.json` is already UNSTAMPED from the 2026-08-03 flag day and
`check-descriptor-drift.sh` is already RED; this adds rows to that ledger and the stamp remains the
operator's ceremony.

⚠ **AND WHAT PUBLICATION DOES *NOT* BUY, said in the same breath.** It buys the weld's
REACHABILITY. Until a fold `cb.connect`s these seventeen slots to the chain root's claim lanes, what
relates this nonet to that chain's root is still an EXECUTOR comparison — and the accumulator's own
tie to *this block's* preimage stays a comparison against `packToFields (bodyI decoded)`, a hash the
node computes from bytes it already holds.

## Scope — do NOT overclaim

⚠ This does **not** make the Mina light client's linkage verified. What a STARK over this descriptor
proves is: *there exists a sequence of `PI_SEG_LEN` canonical-`Fp` `(parent, bodyHash, ownHash)`
triples, running from `PI_ANCHOR` to `PI_TIP`, with contiguous heights, each recursion-bound to a
sub-proof of the pinned Poseidon-over-Pasta program.*

⚑ **CAN A PROVER STILL CHOOSE THE CHAIN'S HASHES? NO — and here is exactly what changed.** Before
today a prover picked every `OWNHASH` and therefore picked the TIP outright. Now the anchor is
pinned, each `OWNHASH` is `Poseidon_salt(PARENT, BODYHASH)`, and `PARENT[i+1] = OWNHASH[i]`, so the
whole chain — the tip included — is a FORWARD computation from the pinned anchor and the body
hashes. To publish a tip of its choosing a prover must invert Poseidon; to open one tip to two
histories it must collide it.

⚠ **WHAT THIS DESCRIPTOR CAN STILL CHOOSE IS `BODYHASH`**, and the residual moved on 2026-08-07
rather than closing. `state_body_hash`'s own preimage IS derived now — `MinaStateBodyHashChain`, 25
links of the deployed `dregg-pasta-fp-chainlink::v1` from the pinned `MinaProtoStateBody` salt over
the block's packed `Body.to_input`, proved and folded — so **the value a prover chooses moved from
one felt to that felt's 2 381-bit preimage.** Say it in those words: relocated, not eliminated.
⚠ **And the tie to THESE columns is not a constraint.** A `proofBind` can only name published
values and `BODYHASH` is not PI-bound here (`LightClientAnchorConnectivity.
minaLink_body_hash_is_joined_but_not_published`), so what relates this nonet to that chain's root is
an EXECUTOR comparison. The flag day that would make it in-circuit is named in §"WHAT THIS BREAKS".
Nothing here says a body hash is a real Mina block body either; that is
`PICKLES_OPENING_WITNESSED` (⚑ renamed and narrowed 2026-08-06), still a witness.
⚠ Three further limits, none of them repealed: the seam's off-row half is the FRI/recursion
obligation this whole stack carries; the limb re-encoding between this descriptor's `Faithful9`
lanes and the absorb descriptor's 32 eight-bit limbs is an EXECUTOR check, not a constraint; and
fork choice is still not here (`LightClientMinaGate`'s unchanged scope note).

no preimage: Mina's identity is
`state_hash = Poseidon_Fp(salt "MinaProtoState")[previous_state_hash ; state_body_hash]`
(`Bridge/MinaStateHashDerive.lean:31`, `:392`), and the second argument was in no column. It is one

⚑ **AND SINCE 2026-08-07 IT IS DERIVED — OFF THIS DESCRIPTOR, AND SAY WHICH.**

below relates `BODYHASH` to that chain's root, because a `proofBind` can only name PUBLIC INPUTS and
these nine columns are not published. That is the flag day this rung leaves and §"WHAT THIS BREAKS"
names it. What makes it a real block BODY — as opposed to a preimage somebody chose — is

claim's `transcript_acc`. Columns 40..47, published at PI 29..36.

⚑⚑ **THIS IS THE COLUMN THAT KEEPS THE BODY-CHAIN SEAM FROM BEING VACUOUS**, and it was named
before it was built: *"A BIND OF `(salt, BODYHASH)` ALONE WOULD BE VACUOUS … `perm` is a
permutation, so 25 links from a fixed head with free absorbed inputs reach every field element.
Naming the stream is the whole content."* The accumulator IS the stream, ordered — so the seam's
commitment is `salt ‖ BODYHASH ‖ acc(absorbed)` and not `(salt, BODYHASH)`.

⚠ **NOT RANGE-GATED, and that is not an omission.** These are BabyBear Poseidon2 digest lanes, i.e.

/-! ## §2b — ⚑⚑⚑ THE STATE-HASH SEAM: `OWNHASH` STOPS BEING A FREE WITNESS.

## What was here this morning, and why the price was wrong by 26×

The file's own header called Mina's linkage hash a WALL and priced it: *"~500 Pasta multiplications
per permutation, ≈5·10⁵ BabyBear constraints per block hash, ~1.5·10⁸ for a Samasika-depth
segment."* Both halves of that estimate were re-derived here and both moved.

⚑ **THE PERMUTATION COUNT: 1 PER BLOCK, NOT 26.** `Bridge/MinaStateHashDerive.lean:31` reads the
daemon (`protocol_state.ml:45-55`) and says what a Mina block's identity IS:

    state_hash = Poseidon_Fp( salt "MinaProtoState" )[ previous_state_hash ; state_body_hash ]

**Two field elements at rate 2 is ONE block and ONE permutation.** The salt is
`Random_oracle.update ~state:[0,0,0] [|prefix_to_field s|]` — a CONSTANT, permuted at emit time, not
in circuit. The `~26 permutations/block` the standing estimate carried is the *transcript* chain's
link count (phase-1 is 27 links, phase-2 is 46); it is not the state hash. The deep hash is
`state_body_hash`, over ~38 field elements — and that one is **not part of the linkage**: it enters
here as a witnessed nonet and what attests it is `PICKLES_OK`, exactly as before.

⚑ **AND THE CIRCUIT DOES NOT NEED BUILDING — IT IS EMITTED AND IT PROVES.**
`dregg-pasta-fp-absorb::v1` (`MinaWrapVerifierSpongeFp.fpAbsorbDesc`) is a 2 048-row, 469-column,
858-constraint instance of the Pasta program VM whose 660 ROM immediates are `fp_kimchi`'s own
`static_params()`, checked on the emitted bytes (`circuit/tests/pasta_fp_sponge_proves.rs` §9). It
computes `perm(state + [x₀, x₁, 0])` and — the fact that makes it usable here —
`the_absorb_program_permutes_gen` has **no hypothesis on the incoming state**, which is not a
descriptor constant but PUBLIC INPUT slots `[0, 3·SK)`. So a *salted* sponge is the SAME descriptor
with different public inputs; `MinaPhase1Chain` already threads 27 links of non-zero state through
it. Nothing new is authored, and in particular **no non-native Pasta multiply is authored here**
(`minaLink_products_are_only_the_real_bit` still holds, §3b).

Re-derived segment cost, at the measured leaf/fold times of that same descriptor family (9.5 s a
leaf, 11.5 s a fold node, `mina_phase2_chain_fold`): a Samasika-depth `k = 290` segment is 290
leaves + 289 fold nodes ≈ **1 h 41 min**, against the inherited **44 h**. ⚠ That is an
extrapolation from a same-shaped descriptor's measured times, not a fresh wall-clock measurement of
290 leaves, and it is labelled as one.

## The leg, and why the commitment has FOUR nonets in it

`ProofBind`'s `commit` is the only vector naming off-row evidence, so the only way a `proofBind` can
join a column is for that column to BE part of the commitment. The sentence that has to be true is
`OWNHASH = Poseidon_{salt}(PARENT, BODYHASH)`, and it names SIX `Fp` elements — the salt's three
sponge lanes and the row's three nonets. All six are in the commit vector, elementwise, nine
`Faithful9` lanes each — **54 lanes, `8·29 + 22 = 254` bits an element, no digest, therefore no
birthday bound.**

⚑ **THE SALT LANES ARE `.const`, AND THEY ARE THE LOAD-BEARING PART.** With a free incoming state
the seam would be VACUOUS and not weakly so: `perm` is a permutation, so for any target `out` a
prover picks `state := perm⁻¹(T) − [x₀,x₁,0]` for any `T` with `T[0] = out` and the sub-proof is
honest. Pinning the three state lanes as descriptor CONSTANTS is what makes the bound sub-proof a
*Mina* state hash rather than a generic two-input Poseidon.

⚑ **THE GUARD IS `1`, NOT `IS_REAL`, AND THAT CLOSES A HOLE THIS FILE DID NOT KNOW IT HAD.**
`Satisfied2Custom.proofBound` quantifies over EVERY row, so a guard column would let a prover switch
the seam off — and the natural choice, `IS_REAL`, switches it off exactly where the tip lives: the
`.last` tip pin reads the LAST row whether or not that row is real, `laneContinuity` is
unconditional, so `[real, real, real, pad]` chains into a padding row whose `OWNHASH` is free and
IS `PI_TIP`. An unconditional guard makes every row of the trace a state-hash step and the tip the
image of the chain regardless of `IS_REAL`. -/

/-- ⚑ **THE `MinaProtoState` SALT, AS 27 `Faithful9` LANES.** The three-lane sponge state
`Random_oracle.salt "MinaProtoState"` — `Bridge/MinaStateHashDerive.saltProtoState`, itself pinned
to openmina's OWN regression constants (`poseidon/tests/test_hash_params.rs:28-51`), which is what
exercises the 20-byte `'*'` padding, the little-endian prefix read, the Kimchi constants and the
absorb schedule in one line. Decomposed here base `2^29`, low lane first, nine lanes per element.

⚠ These are the `commit` vector's CONSTANT head. A wrong lane here does not fail loudly — it names
a different salt, i.e. a different chain's hash function — so `mina_link_salt_lanes_are_the_salt`
recomposes all three and compares against `saltProtoState` itself rather than against a comment. -/

⚑ `bound := none` and it is the right choice for the same reason the head's segment seam gives:
`bound` forces `commit` to equal a row-local expression, and every `commit` lane here is already
either a descriptor CONSTANT or a `.var` on this row. A `bound` congruence could only compare each

/-! ### §2c — ⚑⚑⚑ THE BODY-CHAIN SEAM: `BODYHASH` STOPS BEING AN UNBOUND ARGUMENT.

**2026-08-08.** `MinaStateBodyHashChain` derived `state_body_hash` on 08-07 and folded it, and
`LightClientAnchorConnectivity.minaLink_body_hash_is_joined_but_not_published` named the exact reason
nothing here could reach it:

> *"`isPiBound = false` is now the SPECIFIC gap … a `proofBind`'s `commit`/`vk` name PUBLISHED values
> and a recursion fold reads `air_public_targets`, so **an unpublished `BODYHASH` cannot be
> `cb.connect`ed to the body-hash chain's root at all**."*

So the nonet is published (PI 20..28) and the chain's ordered accumulator with it (PI 29..36), and
this leg names both.

⚑⚑ **AND THE ACCUMULATOR IS NOT OPTIONAL — the vacuity was named before anything could be built.**
`(salt, BODYHASH)` alone commits to a hash from a pinned head over a FREE stream, and `perm` is a
permutation: 25 links from a fixed head reach every field element, so such a bind refuses nothing.
The commitment here is `salt ‖ BODYHASH ‖ acc`, where `acc` is the 8-lane ordered digest of the 49
absorbed packed elements the chain's fold publishes as `transcript_acc`. **Naming the stream is the
whole content**, and it is what makes this a claim about a *body* rather than about a permutation.

⚠ **WHAT IS STILL OWED AFTER THIS, said plainly.** Publishing buys the weld's REACHABILITY, not the
weld. Until a fold `cb.connect`s these 17 PI slots to the chain root's claim lanes, the tie is an
EXECUTOR comparison — and the accumulator's own tie to *this* block's preimage stays a comparison
against `packToFields (bodyI decoded)`, a hash the node computes from bytes it already holds. -/

/-- ⚑ **THE `MinaProtoStateBody` SALT, AS 27 `Faithful9` LANES.** `Bridge.MinaStateHashDerive.
saltProtoStateBody`, itself pinned to openmina's OWN regression constants
(`poseidon/tests/test_hash_params.rs:28-51`). Decomposed base `2^29`, low lane first.

⚠ A LITERAL and not the computed expression, for a measured reason: `saltProtoStateBody` is a Kimchi
Poseidon permutation and reducing one under the kernel costs 47.6 GB / 68 min in this tree, so a
`rfl` shape pin over a computed salt would not elaborate. `mina_link_body_salt_lanes_are_the_body_
salt` recomposes all three elements and compares against `saltProtoStateBody` itself.

⚠ **AND IT IS THE OTHER SALT.** `MINA_PROTO_STATE_SALT_LANES` is `"MinaProtoState"`; this is
`"MinaProtoStateBody"`. Mina's whole domain separation between a state hash and a body hash rests on
the two being different, and a copy-paste here would name a different hash function with every gate
green — `the_two_seams_name_two_different_salts` is that as a theorem. -/

whose public-input commitment is `salt ‖ x ‖ y ‖ z` in `Faithful9` lanes, has
`laneVal z = Poseidon_{salt}(laneVal x, laneVal y)`.

descriptor's file PROVES about the emitted object

`the_emitted_fp_absorb_output_is_K3s_hash`, on the SAME `programAir` at `pLimb`, with the incoming
state a public input and `the_absorb_program_permutes_gen` carrying no hypothesis on it). What is
NOT discharged here is the recursion boundary itself — that a verifying STARK implies its statement
— which is the FRI obligation this whole stack carries and names
(`RecursiveAggregation.EngineSound.recursive_sound`). Every `proofBind` in this tree stands at
exactly that resolution; this one is not weaker and not stronger.

⚠ It also carries a LIMB-ENCODING obligation the consumer discharges: the absorb descriptor
publishes 32 eight-bit limbs an element and this seam commits nine base-`2^29` lanes, so the node
re-limbs 54 lanes into six 32-limb blocks and refuses a mismatch. That is an executor check, not a

seam plus `LeafHashIsMina`, and the only thing left in that second hypothesis is an ENCODING claim

protocol-state PREIMAGE SHAPE — and it is genuinely still open at the bridge-leaf boundary: the
abstract leaf hashes a four-tuple while the daemon hashes `[previous_state_hash ; state_body_hash]`
