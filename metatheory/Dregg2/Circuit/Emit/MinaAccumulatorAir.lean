# `Dregg2.Circuit.Emit.MinaAccumulatorAir` — ⚑ THE DEFERRED IPA ACCUMULATOR CHECK, IN A CIRCUIT.

## ⚑ SAY THE SUBSTRATE OUT LOUD

**This is Lean-authored AIR.** Every column index, every pin, every window body, the routing tuple,
the declared manifest and all three emitted descriptors are authored here and go through
`EffectLower.lowerAir` of an `EffectAirIR.EffectAir`.
There is no hand-written `VmConstraint2` in this file. Rust PROVES the artifact, FOLDS it, and
authors no constraint. House Law #1.

## WHAT IS BEING PUT IN A CIRCUIT, and it is the leg upstream evaluates natively

`mina-rust`'s verifier `&&`s `Ipa::Step::accumulator_check` into `batch_step_dlog_check`
(`verify.ml:135-146`). With `C` the challenge-polynomial commitment (a **Vesta** point) and `u⃗` the
sixteen endo-lifted bulletproof challenges,

```text
    C == ⟨ b_poly_coefficients(u⃗), srs.g ⟩          |srs.g| = 2^16 = 65 536 Vesta generators
```

and a batch of `N` claims is discharged by ONE MSM over `|G| + N` points:

```text
    Σ_i r^i·C_i  −  ⟨ Σ_i r^i·s(u⃗_i), G ⟩  ==  O
```

`bridge/src/mina_accumulator_discharge.rs` evaluates that **natively** over the byte-pinned SRS, and
`turn/src/executor/mina_accumulator_oracle.rs` makes a Mina head's acceptance depend on it. Both of
those files say, in their own headers, that **nothing there is an AIR**. This file is the AIR.

## ⚑ THE SHAPE, and why the accumulator's ENTRY POINT is the claim

Read the batch relation as a running sum and it is a chain of complete additions:

```text
    acc_0    = C                       -- ⚑ the claim's commitment IS the initial accumulator
    acc_{r+1} = acc_r + A_r            -- A_r the r-th addend
    acc_n    = O                       -- the discharge
```

so with the addends `A_r` the scaled generators `−s_j·G_j`, `acc_n = O` **is** `C − ⟨s, G⟩ = O`.

That is why this file needs no separate "claim block": the accumulator entering row 0 is `C`, it is
published at `PI[0..95]`, and it is joined arithmetically (the six input limb legs range it and the
33 SSA ops read it) rather than pinned decoratively. A consumer that holds this block's `C` compares
it against those 96 published limbs **elementwise — 256 bits per coordinate, no digest and therefore
no birthday bound**, the same shape `LightClientMinaAir`'s `TIP_STATE` seam takes.

## ⚑ WHAT A THREAD BUYS THAT A RE-PIN DOES NOT — inherited, not re-argued

`PastaLadderThread` established it and this file consumes it: the accumulator crosses rows through
96 `AirLeg.window .transition` gates, so `threadedLadder_forces` is an `n`-row induction rather than
a chain of quoted outputs. The width is `RCB_WIDTH = 3 048` at every depth, and the depth is rows.

The same distinction is what the RECURSION half has to preserve. `mina_phase2_chain_leaf`'s lesson —
*"a fold that just re-pins the same public inputs closes nothing"* — is answered here by publishing
`acc_in ‖ acc_out` as **contiguous** PI blocks so a fold node `cb.connect`s the left child's 96
outgoing limbs to the right child's 96 incoming ones. The 96 is not a coincidence: a projective
Pasta point in the sound 8-bit encoding is `3 × 32 = 96` felts, exactly the width the phase-2 chain
already carries its sponge state on.

## ⚑ FOUR DESCRIPTORS, AND EACH PAIR IS AN EXHIBIT

* `dregg-mina-accumulator-seg::v1` — a SEGMENT of the chain. Publishes its two endpoints. Says
  nothing about vanishing, because an intermediate segment must not.
* `dregg-mina-accumulator-final::v1` — the segment PLUS `dischargeLegs`: `2 · SK = 64` `.last`-row
  window gates forcing every limb of the terminal `X` and `Z` blocks to **zero**. That is
  `pasta_msm::is_identity` (`z == 0 && x == 0`) as a constraint, and it is the accumulator check.

* ⚑ `dregg-mina-accumulator-routed::v1` (§8) — the final segment PLUS the ROUTING: a threaded
  row-index column, and one exact-public lookup per row whose 97-wide tuple is
  `(row index + 1) ‖ the row's 96 addend limbs`, against a manifest the descriptor DECLARES.
  `3 049` columns, `4 831` constraints.

* ⚑⚑ `dregg-mina-accumulator-srs::v1` (§10) — `-routed`'s ALGEBRA VERBATIM over a manifest that is
  **not a parameter**: `srsScaledAddends Gs u⃗ n`, whose `r`-th entry is `−s_r · G_r` for
  `s_r = b_poly_coefficients(u⃗)_r` and `G_r` the generator the pinned SRS carries at index `r`.
  Same `3 049` columns and `4 831` constraints; what differs is that no list of points occurs in
  its definition.

Each pair is an OLD-ADMITS / NEW-REJECTS exhibit that cannot rot into agreement. A chain that does
not vanish PROVES under `-seg` and is REFUSED under `-final`, and the refusing constraint is a
`.last` window gate on an `OUT_Z` limb — not a range lookup, not a bus. A chain of honest Vesta
points that are NOT this block's addends PROVES under `-final` and is REFUSED under `-routed`, and
the refusing constraint is the exact-public balance of `mina_accumulator_addends`.

## What is proved here

* `accSegAir_mainRailOk` / `accFinalAir_mainRailOk` — the compiler accepts both blocks.
* `accSegDesc_constraint_count` / `accFinalDesc_constraint_count` / the widths and PI counts.
* `the_discharge_is_sixty_four_last_row_gates` — the selector census, so a `.last → .all` re-scope
  (which would refuse every intermediate row and make the descriptor accept nothing) moves a number.
* `threadedLadderV_forces` — the Vesta twin of `PastaLadderThread.threadedLadder_forces`.
* `terminalAccumulator_forces` — an `n+1`-row trace's terminal output is the `n+1`-fold RCB chain.
* ⚑ `accumulator_discharge_forced` — rows satisfied + threads held + the discharge gates satisfied
  force the `n+1`-fold chain of the trace's own addends to be the point at infinity mod `q`. This is
  the accumulator check, as a consequence of the emitted constraints.
* `the_discharge_gate_is_refutable` — a trace satisfying every ROW and every THREAD whose terminal
  accumulator is NOT the identity, so `accumulator_discharge_forced`'s last hypothesis is doing work.
* ⚑⚑ `addend_is_its_declared_addend` — **the routing.** On a trace whose emitted lookup balances and
  whose index column is threaded, row `i`'s addend cells ARE the descriptor's declared addend `i`.
  Pure membership: no counting, no pigeonhole, and `i`/`As.length` occur in no bound.
* ⚑⚑ `accumulator_discharge_forced_on_declared_addends` — the discharge over `declaredChain`, a fold
  in which the trace's addend columns **do not occur**.
* `the_balance_forces_the_row_count` — the trace height is the declared addend count, FORCED by the
  permutation, so the chain cannot be padded with unrouted rows nor shortened by dropping one.
* ⚑ `the_full_srs_routing_needs_no_cap_to_move` / `the_cell_cap_counts_the_declared_multiset_and_
  not_the_allocation` (§9) — the three exact-public caps, each against what it actually counts,
  established BEFORE §10 was designed rather than after.
* ⚑⚑ `declAddend_of_srsScaled` — the value `declaredChain` folds at index `r` IS `−s_r · G_r`, over
  ℤ with no canonicality envelope, via a general base-`2^SB` recomposition (`sumL_limbs`) rather
  than a `decide` at the demonstration's numbers.
* ⚑⚑⚑ `accumulator_discharge_forced_on_srs_scaled_addends` — the discharge over
  `declaredChain (srsScaledAddends Gs u⃗ n)`, a fold in which **no list of points occurs**.

## ⚠ WHAT THIS DOES **NOT** ESTABLISH — and the residual MOVED on 2026-08-06

It used to read: *"nothing here forces the ADDENDS to be anything in particular … porting the
routing to the sound row's 32-limb encoding is real work this file does not do (§4 prices it,
including the one deployed constant — `MAX_EXACT_PUBLIC_ARITY = 64` — that a 96-limb point tuple
exceeds)."* **That work is done** (§8). The cap was the member count of a JSON artifact; it was
raised `64 → 97`, the artifact re-emitted, the constant re-pinned, and the 97-wide tuple is now
DECLARED and FORCED.

⚠ **THE RESIDUAL THAT REMAINS IS ONE OBJECT OUT, AND IT IS A DIFFERENT KIND.** The routing forces
row `i`'s addend to be the addend THIS DESCRIPTOR DECLARES. Whether the descriptor a node verified
against is the one for the block in hand is a DESCRIPTOR-SELECTION question — the same class as the
accumulator's two other trusted items, both of which are still open:

  1. **No gate ties the claim to a head.** `root_entry_binds_claim` is a CONSUMER refusal, not a
     constraint; nothing in any of the three descriptors says the accumulator entering row 0 is the
     commitment of the block whose head is being accepted.
  2. **A claim rebuilt around tampered challenges is accepted** — in-circuit exactly as natively.
     The challenges `u⃗` are not bound to a transcript by anything here.

## ⚑⚑ AND THE SCALING MOVED ON 2026-08-07 — §10, WITH THE TRICHOTOMY SAID OUT LOUD

The paragraph here used to read: *"the SCALING is still not routed … what the declared manifest pins
is the ADDENDS, not their provenance as scaled generators."* §10 changes what the manifest IS.
`srsScaledAddends Gs u⃗ n` is a TOTAL FUNCTION whose `r`-th entry is `−s_r · G_r`; `accSrsDesc` is
the descriptor at it; `accumulator_discharge_forced_on_srs_scaled_addends` concludes over that fold.
The emitter can no longer supply a point — its only inputs are a generator list and `|u⃗|` field
elements — and `circuit/tests/mina_accumulator_srs_proves.rs` re-derives every declared entry
natively from the **sha-pinned** `vesta_srs_g` blob and refuses the rung below's manifest.

⚠ **THE RESIDUAL IS NOW EXACTLY ONE THING AND IT IS STRUCTURAL, NOT AN OMISSION.** The derivation
runs in the EMITTER; nothing in this AIR re-derives the manifest from `u⃗` in-circuit. The scaling
relation can live in exactly three places and there is no fourth:

  1. **THE CIRCUIT** — that is the deferred MSM. `PastaMsmBucketed.fused_at_step` prices the group
     work at `1 474 800` complete additions, and §7.2 of that file records those rows are
     denominated in the UNSOUND multiply, so on THIS file's sound row it is ~10² further out. It is
     also the thing `mina_accumulator_discharge.rs`'s own header calls the innovation to defer.
  2. **THE EMITTER** — §10. Certifying the emitted manifest then costs a native re-derivation,
     which is `n` scalar multiplications, which is the discharge. So §10 does not beat the native
     check; what it changes is the OBJECT a certifier checks, from `n` arbitrary Vesta points to
     `|u⃗|` field elements and a byte-pinned blob.
  3. **NOWHERE** — §8, a free 97-wide table.

`PastaMsmBucketed` §7.3 reached (2) from the other side — *"the descriptor, and therefore the
verifying key, is a function of the scalar vector: one VK per Mina block"* — and §7.4 declares the
challenge-binding half TERMINAL for any MSM AIR. Neither is invented here and both still stand.

So the emitted object checks the **SUMMATION half at full 256-bit width, over addends the VERIFIER
rebuilds from the descriptor rather than accepts from the prover, and which the DESCRIPTOR in turn
derives from a pinned SRS and a challenge vector rather than carrying as data.** That is strictly
more than before and strictly less than `Ipa.Step.accumulator_check`.

/-! ## §2 — ⚑ THE DISCHARGE GATE.

`pasta_msm::is_identity` is `p.z == U256::ZERO && p.x == U256::ZERO`. On the projective curve
`Y²Z = X³ + bZ³` those two are not independent — `Z = 0` forces `X³ = 0` — but the AIR does not
carry an on-curve gate, so BOTH are forced here and the constraint is the deployed predicate rather
than an argument about it.

⚑ **Every LIMB is forced to zero, not the value.** `sVal` over 32 byte-ranged limbs ranges to
`2^256 > q`, so "the value is `≡ 0 mod q`" would also be satisfied by the limbs of `q` and of `2q`.
Forcing the limbs makes the terminal accumulator the CANONICAL zero, which is strictly stronger,
costs nothing (the honest witness reduces) and removes a representation the prover could otherwise
choose. -/

/-- One discharge gate: the `i`-th limb of the block at `base`, on the LAST row, is zero.

`.last` is the selector, and `WindowLeg.mainRailOk` admits it because the body reads no `nxt`. Under
`.all` this would fire on EVERY row and refuse every intermediate accumulator — a descriptor that
accepts nothing, which is the direction a selector confusion goes here. -/

/-- ⚑ **THE ROUTING RESIDUAL — REFUSED AT HEAD, BUT THE CAP IS NOT A PRICE.**

Forcing the addend of row `r` to be a DECLARED SRS generator is an exact-public lookup whose tuple
is the generator index plus the point's limbs. In the sound encoding a projective point is
`3 · 32 = 96` limbs, so the tuple is `97` wide against the deployed `MAX_EXACT_PUBLIC_ARITY = 64`
(`circuit/src/descriptor_ir2.rs:531`), and `check_descriptor2` refuses it (`:2135`). **That refusal
is real and nothing should be designed as though it were not.**

⚠ **BUT THE EARLIER DRAFT OF THIS DOCBLOCK CALLED 64 A PRICE, AND IT IS NOT ONE.** Read at source
2026-08-06: the constant's ONLY other use is a drift guard whose own message says the remedy —
*"the emitted exact-public family covers {family_len} arities but this file admits
{MAX_EXACT_PUBLIC_ARITY}; re-emit `dregg-ir2-exact-public-v1.json` or re-pin the cap"*
(`descriptor_ir2.rs:6737-6742`). So 64 is **the number of members in a checked-in JSON artifact**,
pinned on both sides so the two cannot drift. It is exact as that, and it bounds no resource: the
committed object is `next_pow2(distinct) × (arity + 2)` preprocessed cells in ONE instance
(`ExactPublicManifest::of` at `:3370`, `prep_width` at `:3386`), and at `2^16` distinct generators
a 97-wide table is **6 488 064** cells — 26 MB, one instance.

⚑ It was introduced (`dc285da37`, 2026-07-22) under a comment justifying ROWS and CELLS — *"each row
becomes one batch instance, so bound the grammar before allocation"* — which is an argument about
instance count, and arity does not scale instance count. Its two siblings in that comment have since
moved by `2^14×` and `2^13×`; 64 has never been touched. `a-cost-verdict-outlives-its-premise`.

## ⚑⚑ CLOSED 2026-08-06 — THE CAP WAS RAISED AND THE TUPLE IS DECLARED

`EP_MAX_ARITY` went `64 → 97` (`ExactPublicTableEmit`, `descriptor_ir2.rs:591`), the family artifact
was re-emitted at `128 142` bytes, and `MAX_EXACT_PUBLIC_ARITY` was re-pinned on the Rust side. §8
now DECLARES the 97-wide tuple (`addendTable`) and §8b FORCES it

This file used to prescribe `PastaMsmBucketed.split_srs_cells_fit`'s medicine — split the 96 limbs

FRI opening set — and a soundness leg the wide table does not have, since **nothing forces the two
halves keyed by index `r` to name limbs of the SAME generator.**

The fold's bill is paid in COLUMNS: `circuit-prove/tests/mina_accumulator_leaf_anatomy.rs` measures
the leaf wrap's in-circuit verifier at **2 878 067 ops** for this 3 048-column descriptor against
**248 555** for the 469-column `pasta-fq-chainlink::v1` that folds 46 leaves in production — and the
same measurement's ROW sweep moves the figure by **0.5% across 1 → 8 inner rows**. So the width is
the whole bill and the height is free, and the question this section answers is not "how big is the
row" but **"how much of the row is scratch that only exists because 33 SSA ops share one row."**

Every number below is `decide`d from the layout definitions the descriptor is emitted from — not a
second copy of them. -/

The six input blocks are read by the row's own gadget and by the 96 `.transition` threads; the three
output blocks `OUT_X/OUT_Y/OUT_Z` are pinned on `.last` and threaded forward. **Nothing else in the
row is visible outside it.** `9.4%` of the width is the row's interface and `90.6%` is intermediates
that exist because one complete addition is one row.

⚑ This is the number that says the narrowing is a LAYOUT change and not a soundness change: a row
carrying ONE SSA op instead of 33 does not have to hold the other 32 ops' scratch, and every
constraint `swCompleteAddSoundLegs` emits is a statement about a single op's operands and output.
`PastaLadderThread` made exactly this move one rail down — the row-local ladder was 731 136 columns
in one row before depth became rows — and the emitted width has been flat at `RCB_WIDTH` ever since,

induction is re-run at `q` against `vestaCompleteAddSound_forces`. The proof body is the same three

OUTPUT, which `threadedLadderV_forces` alone does not: it stops at the accumulator entering row `n`.

/-- ⚑⚑ **THE ACCUMULATOR CHECK, FORCED BY THE EMITTED CONSTRAINTS.**

`n+1` rows of deployed satisfaction, `n` held threads, and the 64 discharge gates force the
`n+1`-fold RCB chain of the trace's own addends — starting from the accumulator published at
`PI[0..95]` — to be the point at infinity mod the real Vesta-base prime.

Read against the relation this file exists for: with `acc_0 = C` and the addends the scaled
generators, this says `C − ⟨s(u⃗), G⟩ = O`, which is `Ipa.Step.accumulator_check`.

⚠ **IT SAYS NOTHING ABOUT WHAT THE ADDENDS ARE.** The limit is not softened: on THIS descriptor
(`-final`, which declares no manifest and emits no routing lookup) the chain is still the fold of
whatever `ADD_X/Y/Z` the trace supplies, and calling this the whole check would be the substitution
this repo keeps finding.

⚑ **WHAT CHANGED IS THAT A DESCRIPTOR EXISTS FOR WHICH THE STRONGER STATEMENT IS TRUE.** §8's
`dregg-mina-accumulator-routed::v1` routes the addends against a declared exact-public manifest and
`accumulator_discharge_forced_on_declared_addends` concludes over `declaredChain` — a fold in which
the trace's addend columns do not occur. `-final` is KEPT as the OLD-ADMITS pole of that pair: a
chain whose addends are honest Vesta points that are not this block's proves here and is refused
there. -/

/-! ### ⚠ THE NON-VACUITY OF `RowSoundV` IS WITNESSED BEHAVIOURALLY, NOT IN THIS KERNEL.

`accumulator_discharge_forced` would be vacuous if `RowSoundV` were unsatisfiable, and **nothing in
this file proves it is not**. What witnesses it is the deployed prover accepting the honest trace
under `dregg-mina-accumulator-final::v1` (`circuit/tests/mina_accumulator_air_proves.rs`, both
polarities, release) — behavioural evidence, one rail down, and `PastaLadderThread`'s
`threadedLadder_forces` has exactly the same status.

⚑ This is UNDONE WORK wearing a caveat, not a theorem of the model, so here is what it would cost.
A kernel witness means exhibiting one `Assignment` and discharging `RcbSat` on it — 33 SSA ops, 12
multiply witnesses at 32 quotient limbs and 62 carries each, all reduced at `q`. That is the
`decide`-through-a-real-field-element shape `minted-poseidon2-perm-is-a-reduction-bomb` measured at
47.6 GB for ONE permutation, so it is a `native_decide` + `#assert_compiled` job (a confession, not a
certificate) or a genuine satisfiability lemma over `rcbSoundRow` — which is the thing actually worth
building, because it would serve every descriptor in this cone rather than this one.

⚠ And the OTHER end is not closed either: these theorems speak the SOURCE vocabulary (`RcbSat`,
`Ranged`), and this file lowers with `lowerAir` rather than the certified `lowerTiedAir`, so the
`AirLeg.forces` bridge from the emitted constraints back to those predicates is inherited from
`PastaCurveSound`/`EffectLowerCertified` rather than re-established here. `lowerTiedAir` was not used
because `EffectAir.pinsTied` is a quadratic `decide` over ~4 000 legs against 192 pins; that is a
cost, and a cost is not a reason to call the weaker thing done.

## §7 — ⚑ AND THE LAST HYPOTHESIS IS DOING WORK.

A theorem whose final hypothesis were unsatisfiable, or satisfied by everything, would prove nothing
about the gate it is named for. Both directions are exhibited: a trace where `Discharged` HOLDS and
one where it FAILS, over assignments that agree everywhere the discharge does not look. -/

/-- ⚑ **THE REFUTATION.** `oneTrace` differs from `zeroTrace` in exactly ONE cell, that cell is
INSIDE the declared 8-bit limb width (so no range lookup can be what separates them), and the
discharge gate refuses it. A falsifier that moved a zero into a zero is the failure this exhibit is
built against: the moved value is `1`, and it is asserted to be nonzero. -/

/-! ## §8 — ⚑⚑ THE ROUTING: THE ADDENDS ARE THE DESCRIPTOR'S, NOT THE PROVER'S.

§4 priced this and the price was retracted at source: `MAX_EXACT_PUBLIC_ARITY` is the member count
of a checked-in JSON artifact and bounds no resource. It went `64 → 97` on 2026-08-06
(`ExactPublicTableEmit.EP_MAX_ARITY`, `descriptor_ir2.rs:591`, the artifact re-emitted at
`128 142` bytes), so the 97-wide routing tuple this section needs is admissible and the section
exists.

**The mechanism, and it is the SAME one `PastaMsmBound` used one rail down.** A THREADED row-index
column, and ONE exact-public lookup per row whose tuple is `(row index + 1) ‖ the row's 96 addend
limbs`. `TableSem.exactPublicRows` is a PERMUTATION, not a containment
(`DescriptorIR2.PublicLookupBalanced`), so the declaration says *these addends and no others* — no
omission, no duplication, no substitution.

⚑ **WHAT THAT BUYS, EXACTLY.** `accumulator_discharge_forced` forces the chain of the TRACE'S OWN
addends to vanish. `accumulator_discharge_forced_on_declared_addends` forces the chain of the
DESCRIPTOR'S DECLARED addends to vanish — a statement in which the trace's addend columns do not
appear at all. The verifier REBUILDS the declared manifest from the descriptor bytes (it is a
preprocessed matrix, `ExactPublicManifest::preprocessed`), so those addends are VK-pinned, not
prover-supplied.

⚠ **AND WHAT IT DOES NOT BUY, said at the resolution it is at.** It moves the trust ONE OBJECT
OUT: from *"the addends the prover wrote"* to *"the addends this descriptor declares"*. Whether the
descriptor a node verified against is the one for the block in hand is a DESCRIPTOR-SELECTION
question, the same class as the accumulator's other two trusted items (§9), and it is not closed
here. What is closed is that a prover holding a fixed descriptor can no longer choose them.

⚑ **THE UNROUTED DESCRIPTOR IS KEPT, AND IT IS NOT COMPATIBILITY.** `-final` is the OLD-ADMITS pole
of the routing falsifier: a trace whose addends are honest points that are NOT this block's PROVES
under `-final` and is REFUSED under `-routed`. A pair that cannot rot into agreement is the whole

/-- ⚑⚑⚑ **THE ACCUMULATOR CHECK OVER THE DESCRIPTOR'S OWN ADDENDS.**

`n+1` rows of deployed satisfaction, `n` held accumulator threads, the 64 discharge gates, the
emitted index origin and index thread, and the emitted routing balance force the `n+1`-fold RCB
chain **of the addends this descriptor DECLARES** — starting from the accumulator published at
`PI[0..95]` — to be the point at infinity mod the real Vesta-base prime.

⚑ **READ THE CONCLUSION AGAINST `accumulator_discharge_forced`'S.** That one says
`chainRef tr (n+1) ≡ O`: a fold over `sVal (tr r) ADD_X/Y/Z`, i.e. over columns the prover fills.
This one says `declaredChain As (traceOf t) (n+1) ≡ O`: a fold over `declAddend As r`, in which the
trace's addend columns **do not occur**. The verifier rebuilds `As` from the descriptor bytes
(`ExactPublicManifest::preprocessed`), so those addends are VK-pinned.

⚠ The row count is FORCED, not assumed: `the_balance_forces_the_row_count` derives
`t.rows.length = As.length` from the permutation, so a prover can neither pad the chain with
unrouted rows nor drop a declared addend. `hheight` only names `n` for the discharge's `.last`. -/

/-! ### §8e — ⚠ AND THE ROUTING KEY IS DOING WORK.

The Rust side carries the deployed polarity (`circuit/tests/mina_accumulator_routing_proves.rs`: an
honest chain PROVES and a chain whose addends are real Vesta points that are NOT the declared ones
is REFUSED). What is exhibited here is the KEY's separating power, because a routing whose key
collapsed would make `addend_manifest_key_unique` vacuous while every shape pin still passed. -/

/-- ⚑ **THE KEY SEPARATES TWO ROWS WITH IDENTICAL ADDEND CELLS.** `idxRow 0` and `idxRow 1` agree on
every one of the 96 addend columns — all zero — and their tuples still differ, in the KEY field. So
a prover cannot serve row `i`'s declared addend from row `j`, and the pointwise conclusion of
`addend_is_its_declared_addend` is not an artifact of the addends happening to be distinct.

⚠ The moved value is `1`: NONZERO, and inside the declared 8-bit limb width, so nothing here is a
falsifier that moved a zero into a zero. -/

/-! ### §8f — ⚠ WHAT STANDING EACH HALF OF §8 HAS, AND THEY ARE NOT THE SAME.

§6's note applies unchanged to the ROW half and is not re-argued: `RowSoundV`, `Threaded` — and now
`IdxStarted`/`IdxThreaded` — are the emitted bodies READ AS FACTS ABOUT THE TRACE, and the
`AirLeg.forces` bridge from the emitted constraints back to them is inherited from
`PastaCurveSound`/`EffectLowerCertified` rather than re-established here, because this file lowers
with `lowerAir` and not the certified `lowerTiedAir`. A reader arriving at §8 alone would otherwise
take the two index predicates for something they are not.

⚑ **THE ROUTING HALF STANDS DIFFERENTLY, AND BETTER.** `PublicLookupBalanced` is not a transcription
of an emitted body — it is `DescriptorIR2`'s OWN denotation of the `exactPublicRows` declaration, the
same predicate `demoPublic_duplicate_omission_refused` exercises in both polarities, and the deployed
realization of it is a LogUp PERMUTATION the VERIFIER checks. That is measured rather than argued:
`circuit/tests/mina_accumulator_routing_proves.rs` puts a forged trace past the producer's pre-flight
(`prove_vm_descriptor2_unchecked`) and the deployed verifier refuses it with
`LookupError("GlobalCumulativeMismatch(None): ir2_exact_public_a97")`.

⚠ And the non-vacuity of the routing hypothesis is behavioural, like §6's: what witnesses that
`PublicLookupBalanced (accRoutedDesc demoAddends)` is satisfiable at all is the deployed prover
accepting the honest trace, not anything in this kernel. -/

/-! ## §9 — ⚑⚑ THE CAPS §10 STANDS ON, READ AT SOURCE BEFORE §10 WAS DESIGNED.

⚠ Twice in this cone a cap was designed around before it was read. §4 priced a routing against
`MAX_EXACT_PUBLIC_ARITY = 64` and the constant turned out to be **the member count of a JSON
artifact**, bounding no resource. `the_split_remedy_costs_more_than_the_wide_table` retired a
prescribed remedy that cost MORE than the thing it avoided. And `PastaMsmBucketed` §6c corrected its
own SRS over-count from `21×` to `10×` because the model had forgotten both the all-zero pad row and
`next_pow2`. So the caps are stated here, each against **what it actually counts**, first.

Read at source 2026-08-07, `circuit/src/descriptor_ir2.rs`:

| constant | line | enforced against | what it counts |
|---|---|---|---|
| `MAX_EXACT_PUBLIC_ROWS = 2^21` | `:590` | `rows.len()` (`:2231`) | the DECLARED manifest length, duplicates kept |
| `MAX_EXACT_PUBLIC_CELLS = 2^25` | `:621` | `rows.len() * arity` (`:2232`) | the DECLARED multiset, duplicates kept |
| `MAX_EXACT_PUBLIC_ARITY = 97` | `:616` | a JSON member count (`:6844`) | nothing allocated |

⚑ And the matrix anything MATERIALISES is `ExactPublicManifest::committed_shape` (`:3495`) —
`max (next_pow2 |distinct rows|) 2 × (arity + 2)` — **which is compared against no cap at all.**
`check_descriptor2` is the ONLY enforcement site for the first two and it runs on the declared list
before a cell is allocated. -/

/-- `MAX_EXACT_PUBLIC_ROWS` (`descriptor_ir2.rs:590`). It bounds `rows.len()` of the DECLARED
manifest. Because the exact-public semantics is a PERMUTATION, the declared length is also the trace
height (`the_balance_forces_the_row_count`), so for a routed chain this is the one cap that IS a
height ceiling — not by denomination but by the balance. -/
def EP_ROWS_CAP : Nat := 2097152

/-- `MAX_EXACT_PUBLIC_CELLS` (`descriptor_ir2.rs:621`). It bounds `rows.len() * arity`. -/
def EP_CELLS_CAP : Nat := 33554432

/-- What the CELL cap counts: the declared multiset, duplicates kept. -/
def epDeclaredCells (rows arity : Nat) : Nat := rows * arity

/-- What the verifier COMMITS: `committed_shape`'s height times `prep_width = arity + 2` (the table
id column and the pinned multiplicity column, neither of which the cap's arithmetic sees). -/
def epCommittedCells (height arity : Nat) : Nat := height * (arity + 2)

/-- ⚑⚑ **THE CELL CAP AND THE ALLOCATION DISAGREE IN BOTH DIRECTIONS, AND BOTH DIRECTIONS ARE
EXHIBITED.** A manifest with NO duplicates commits MORE than the cap counts (two extra columns); one
with many duplicates declares far more than it commits. The second exhibit is `PastaMsmBucketed`'s
own SRS manifest — `1 474 800` declared rows at arity `28`, whose `65 537` distinct rows round to a
committed height of `2^17` — and it reproduces that file's `10×` bracket from this file's own two
definitions rather than by citing it.

⚠ This is the theorem that says a cell figure alone never decides admissibility. `srs_cells_exceed_
the_deployed_cap` is TRUE and the object it refuses commits `3 932 160` cells, an eighth of the cap. -/

/-- ⚑⚑ **NO CAP HAS TO MOVE FOR THE FULL-WIDTH SRS ROUTING.**

§10 routes one 97-wide tuple per row against a manifest whose rows are the SRS generators. At the
real object that manifest is `2^16` rows — one per generator, **no duplicates and no pad**, because
the routing declares one manifest row per trace row and the trace height is the generator count.
`65 536 ≤ 2^21`, `65 536 · 97 = 6 356 992 < 2^25` declared, and `65 536 · 99 = 6 488 064 < 2^25`
committed — the committed height is `next_pow2 65 536 = 65 536` exactly, with no `65 537`th distinct
row to push it up a rung.

⚑ So the cap that refuses `PastaMsmBucketed`'s SRS manifest does **not** refuse this one, and the
difference is not width: it is that the windowed layout re-declares every generator once per window
(`20 ×`) and then pads, while the routing declares each once. Same generators, same arity class,
one cap verdict apart. -/

/-! ## §10 — ⚑⚑⚑ THE DECLARED ADDENDS ARE `−s_r · G_r`, DERIVED RATHER THAN DECLARED.

§8 forced the trace's addend cells to be **the descriptor's declared addend `i`**, and said plainly
that this is one object out from the brief: *"nothing says the declared addends are `−s_r·G_r`."*
A prover holding a fixed descriptor could no longer choose them; whoever emitted the descriptor
still could, because `As : List Pt3` is a free parameter and `accRoutedDesc` will emit any 97-wide
table it is handed.

⚑ **THIS SECTION REMOVES THE FREE PARAMETER.** `srsScaledAddends` is a TOTAL FUNCTION of
  * `Gs` — the generator list, and
  * `u⃗` — the endo-lifted bulletproof challenges,

whose `r`-th entry is `−s_r · G_r` with `s_r = b_poly_coefficients(u⃗)_r` and the scalar
multiplication run **by the same complete formula the row computes** (`rcbAddM qN curveB3`, so a
doubling and an identity are handled without a case split). There is no path by which the emitter
supplies a point: the only inputs are a generator list and 16 field elements.

`accSrsDesc` is the descriptor at that manifest. Its algebra is `-routed`'s VERBATIM — same legs,
same constraints, same width, same selector census — so every forcing theorem of §5–§8 applies to it
unchanged, and the ONE thing that differs is what the manifest is a function of.

## ⚠ WHAT THIS DOES NOT BUY, AT FULL RESOLUTION, AND IT IS THE HONEST HALF OF THE SECTION

**`Gs` and `u⃗` are EMITTER parameters, and nothing in this AIR derives the manifest from them.**
The derivation is a Lean function evaluated at emission time; the verifier rebuilds the manifest
from the descriptor bytes and never re-runs it. So a node that wants to know the manifest belongs to
this block must re-derive it natively — which is `2^16` scalar multiplications, i.e. the very MSM
`bridge/src/mina_accumulator_discharge.rs` performs. ⚑ **Stated as the trichotomy it is: the scaling
relation can live in the CIRCUIT (that is the deferred MSM — `PastaMsmBucketed.fused_at_step` prices
the group work at `1 474 800` complete additions, and §7.2 of that file records those rows are
denominated in the UNSOUND multiply, so on THIS file's sound row it is ~10² further out), or in the
EMITTER (this section — and certifying the emitted manifest then costs exactly the native discharge),
or NOWHERE (§8, a free table). There is no fourth place.** What §10 buys is that the middle option is
now a function with named inputs instead of a list, so the object a certifier must check went from
`n` arbitrary Vesta points to `|u⃗|` field elements and a byte-pinned blob.

`PastaMsmBucketed` §7.3 reached the same conclusion from the other side — *"the descriptor, and
therefore the verifying key, is a function of the scalar vector: one VK per Mina block"* — and §7.4
declares the challenge-binding half TERMINAL for any MSM AIR. Neither is invented here; both are
inherited, and both still stand. -/

/-- ⚑⚑⚑ **THE ACCUMULATOR CHECK OVER THE PINNED SCALAR MULTIPLES.**

`n+1` rows of deployed satisfaction, `n` held accumulator threads, the 64 discharge gates, the
emitted index origin and thread, and the emitted routing balance force the `n+1`-fold RCB chain
**of `−s_r · G_r`** — starting from the accumulator published at `PI[0..95]` — to be the point at
infinity mod the real Vesta-base prime.

⚑ **READ THE CONCLUSION AGAINST §8d'S.** `accumulator_discharge_forced_on_declared_addends`
concludes over `declaredChain As`, a fold whose addends are whatever list the emitter was handed.
This one concludes over `declaredChain (srsScaledAddends Gs u n)`, a fold whose addends are the
image of a function of a generator list and `u⃗` — **no list of points occurs in the statement.**

⚠ The limit is §10's docblock and is not softened here: the derivation runs in the EMITTER, so a
certifier still re-derives it natively. What moved is the object it re-derives FROM. -/

/-! ### §10c — ⚠ THE DERIVATION IS REFUTABLE, AND WHERE EACH HALF IS MEASURED.

A derivation that collapsed — `bPolyCoeff` returning `1`, `smulV` ignoring its scalar — would make
every theorem above true and the manifest wrong, and no shape pin in this file would move. Both
halves are therefore exhibited separating. They are exhibited in DIFFERENT PLACES and that is a
decision, not an omission:

* the CHALLENGE half is pure `Nat` arithmetic and is `decide`d here;
* ⚠ the CURVE half is **not** evaluated in this kernel. `smulV` runs `rcbAddM`, whose `rcbTraceM`
  body is a 33-step `let`-chain with heavy reuse, and `minted-poseidon2-perm-is-a-reduction-bomb`
  measured exactly that shape at `47.6 GB` for ONE permutation because `whnf` zeta-expands `let`
  helpers. A `decide` through `[2]·G ≠ [1]·G` would be that bomb. It is measured instead in
  `circuit/tests/mina_accumulator_srs_proves.rs`, against `dregg_circuit::pasta_msm::scalar_mul_at`
  over the **sha-pinned** `VESTA_SRS_G_BIN` — which is better evidence than a kernel `decide` would
  have been, because it checks this derivation against the DEPLOYED native arithmetic and the
  byte-pinned blob rather than against itself. -/

/-- `[0]·P` is the RCB identity `(0 : 1 : 0)`, not a zero triple — a `smulV` seeded with `(0,0,0)`
would make the empty chain add a point off the curve. One equation of the recursion; no field
element is reduced. -/
theorem smulV_at_zero (P : Pt3) : smulV 0 P = OprojN := by
  simp [smulV, smulAux]

/-- ⚑ **THE CHALLENGES MOVE THE COEFFICIENTS, AND IN THE o1-labs ORDER.** At `u⃗ = [3, 5]` the four
coefficients are `1, u₁, u₀, u₀·u₁` — index `1` reads the LAST challenge and index `2` the FIRST. A
`bPolyCoeff` that dropped the `|u|−1−j` reversal would swap these two, produce a manifest that is a
PERMUTATION of the right one, and leave every other theorem in §10 true.

⚠ The moved values are `3` and `5`: nonzero, distinct, and neither is the identity of the product —
so this is not a falsifier that moved a zero into a zero. -/
theorem the_challenge_order_is_the_o1labs_one :
    bPolyCoeff pN [3, 5] 0 = 1
    ∧ bPolyCoeff pN [3, 5] 1 = 5
    ∧ bPolyCoeff pN [3, 5] 2 = 3
    ∧ bPolyCoeff pN [3, 5] 3 = 15
    ∧ bPolyCoeff pN [3, 5] 1 ≠ bPolyCoeff pN [3, 5] 2 := by
  refine ⟨by decide, by decide, by decide, by decide, by decide⟩

/-- …and the coefficient vector is not constant in the challenges: one challenge changes and every
odd index changes with it. This is the half that says the manifest is a function OF `u⃗` and not
merely a function that ignores it. -/

    bPolyCoeff pN [3, 5] 1 ≠ bPolyCoeff pN [3, 7] 1
