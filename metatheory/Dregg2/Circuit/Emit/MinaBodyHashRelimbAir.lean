# `Dregg2.Circuit.Emit.MinaBodyHashRelimbAir` — ⚑⚑ **TIE 2 STOPS BEING ARITHMETICALLY
INEXPRESSIBLE.** The bit-level re-limbing between thirty-two 8-bit limbs and nine 29-bit lanes.

⚑ SUBSTRATE, SAID OUT LOUD (House Law #1): this is a **Lean-authored AIR**. `relimbDesc` is
`EffectLower.lowerTiedAir` applied to the `EffectAir` source `relimbAir` (§3). There is **no
hand-written `VmConstraint2` in this file** and Rust authors nothing; Rust proves the artifact.

## ⚑⚑ THE ARITHMETIC THIS EXISTS TO GET AROUND

The body-hash tie relates thirty-two 8-bit limbs (`dregg-pasta-fp-chainlink::v1`'s squeezed
outgoing lane) to nine 29-bit `Faithful9` lanes (`dregg-mina-lightclient-link::v1`'s `BODYHASH`).
Written directly, `Σ_{k<32} 2^(8k)·limb_k = Σ_{l<9} 2^(29l)·lane_l` carries coefficients to `2^248`
against BabyBear's `p = 2^31 − 2^27 + 1`, so it wraps. **That gate does not exist and this file does
not emit one** — a direct byte↔lane identity is still not a BabyBear linear gate.

What this descriptor does instead is refuse to spell the tie as a relation between two blocks. Both
spellings are read off ONE boolean bit block, so the largest coefficient anywhere is `2^28` (a lane
gate) or `2^7` (a byte gate), and the identity that ties them is not a gate at all but a REGROUPING
theorem over that block (`the_two_spellings_denote_one_value`). Each END of the tie is then an
elementwise pin list, which is what `SeamSpec` can express.

## ⚑ THE SHAPE, AND WHY IT IS 254 BITS AND NOT 256

    col   0 .. 253      BIT j     bit `j` of the value, LSB-first
    col 254 .. 285      BYTE i    Σ_{t<w_i} 2^t · BIT(8i + t)     — coefficients top out at 2^7
    col 286 .. 294      LANE l    Σ_{t<v_l} 2^t · BIT(29l + t)    — coefficients top out at 2^28

    PI  0 ..  31        BYTE i    the chain's spelling  (`dregg-pasta-fp-chainlink::v1`, out lane 0)
    PI 32 ..  40        LANE l    the link's spelling   (`dregg-mina-lightclient-link::v1`, BODYHASH)

⚑⚑ **254, BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT THE LINK'S CANONICALITY GATE MEANS.**
`LightClientMinaAir.MINA_TOP_LANE_BITS` is **22, not the encoder's 24**, and its own docblock says
why: *"`8 · 29 = 232` and `22 + 232 = 254`, so `lane 8 < 2^22` is EXACTLY `value < 2^254`, which is
EXACTLY canonicality (`2^254 < pN`). At 24 the nonet is merely a well-formed 32-byte string and the
`+pN`-shifted anchor passes."* A 256-column bit block would hand the seam two columns the link's
own gate refuses to read, so `byteWidth 31 = 6` and `laneWidth 8 = 22` and the two partitions cover
the SAME 254 bits: `31·8 + 6 = 254 = 8·29 + 22`.

⚑ That makes the descriptor the canonicality gate for the weld rather than a party to it: **there
is no column in which a 255th bit could live**, so the phantom is unrepresentable rather than
gated — the same refusal `MinaBodyPreimageBitsAir`'s `⌈W_e/8⌉` allocation makes one rung down. ⚠ And
say what it costs: the byte seam is UNSATISFIABLE against a chain limb block denoting a value in
`[2^254, pN)`. Those exist (`pN − 2^254 ≈ 2^65.3`, so a fraction `≈ 2^-189` of `Fp`); a body hash in
that window would refuse rather than mis-weld, which is the direction a refusal should fail in.

## ⚑ THE PRICE — LOOKUP-FREE, AND THE MEASUREMENT IS THE POINT

`MinaBodyPreimageBitsAir` paid **1 216 eight-bit range lookups** for its 38 felt-level `.limbs`
legs and its committed width went `3 899 → 6 331`, 1.62×. **This descriptor declares NO table and
emits NO lookup** (`the_relimbing_has_no_lookup_bill`): a booleanity assertion is a degree-2 window
gate and a composition gate is affine, so `MainLayout::build` appends no nibble aux block and the
committed width IS the declared width. The bound on a byte column is not a bus query — it is the
count of bit columns under it (`the_gates_bound_their_own_columns`).

⚠ Said as the arithmetic rather than as a slogan: `BYTE i < 2^8` and `LANE l < 2^29` hold because
there are `w_i` resp. `v_l` boolean summands, so the descriptor's own booleanity legs are the range
gate. That is why the fix specified lookup-free, and it is why it stays that way.

## ⚑ WHAT IT BUYS, AND THE ALIAS THAT SHOWS BOOLEANITY IS LOAD-BEARING

Two theorems, and they need DIFFERENT hypotheses — which is the whole content:

  * **`the_two_spellings_denote_one_value`** — no hypothesis at all. The 32-byte reading and the
    9-lane reading of the same bit columns are the same integer. This is a REGROUPING, not a gate.
  * **`the_relimbing_is_injective`** — needs booleanity, and
    `the_booleanity_hypothesis_is_load_bearing` exhibits what follows when it is dropped:

        bits A: column 28 carries 2      bytes = […, byte 3 = 32, …]   lanes = [2^29, 0, 0, …]
        bits B: column 29 carries 1      bytes = […, byte 3 = 32, …]   lanes = [0,    1, 0, …]

    **Bit columns 28 and 29 are both inside byte 3 and straddle the lane 0 / lane 1 boundary** —
    the byte partition and the lane partition do not refine one another, because `29 % 8 ≠ 0`. So
    without booleanity: *the same thirty-two chain limbs, the same `state_body_hash`, the same
    fold root, every link honest — and the light client's `BODYHASH` nonet is a different felt.*
    That is `Bridge.MinaPackInjective.the_range_hypothesis_is_load_bearing`'s alias one rail down,
    and it is the reason this descriptor gates bits instead of welding bytes to lanes directly.

## ⚑ WHAT THIS BREAKS (flag day, stated so it is findable)

**2026-08-10 — A NEW DESCRIPTOR, `dregg-mina-bodyhash-relimb::v1`.** Nothing existing changes
shape. It emits `circuit/descriptors/by-name/dregg-mina-bodyhash-relimb-v1.json`, mints a VK, and
takes `EmitByName.byNameDescriptors_length` from 131 to 132 (rows and pin are one atom). No VK
rotates, nothing re-genesises, and `PROVENANCE.json` gains no row that this file stamps.

⚠ **AND IT GIVES `MinaSeams.bodyHashPort` A SECOND COVER.** That port was `WeldCover`-only —
REFUSAL 16d, an executor comparison. `MinaBodyHashRelimbSeams.bodyHashPortCovered` adds a
`CoveredPort` over a registered seam; the `WeldCover` stays until a fold applies the seam, because
until then REFUSAL 16d is what a node runs.

/-! ## §9 — ⚠ RESIDUALS, NAMED.

1. ⚠ **THIS DESCRIPTOR TIES NOTHING BY ITSELF.** It publishes two spellings of one value; WHICH
   value is the seams' business (`MinaBodyHashRelimbSeams`), and those are `cb.connect`s a fold
   issues — recursion wiring with a theorem attached, on the undischarged FRI/STARK floor, exactly
   like every other seam in this cone.
2. ⚠ **IT IS 254 BITS AND THE CHAIN IS 256.** A chain limb block denoting a value in `[2^254, pN)`
   has no accepted row here and the byte seam is unsatisfiable against it. That is a REFUSAL, not a
   silent truncation — but it is a refusal, and a body hash in that window (a fraction `≈ 2^-189`
   of `Fp`) would halt rather than weld.
3. ⚠ **NOTHING HERE SAYS THE VALUE IS A `state_body_hash`.** That is the chain's
   (`MinaStateBodyHashChain.the_body_chain_ends_on_the_state_body_hash`) and the seam's, not this
   descriptor's.
