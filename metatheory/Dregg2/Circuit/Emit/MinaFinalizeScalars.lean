# `Dregg2.Circuit.Emit.MinaFinalizeScalars` — ⚑⚑ **`dregg-mina-finalize-scalars::v2`: Pickles'
finalize conjuncts 3 and 4, rendered as a Lean-authored scheduled AIR at the Pallas-scalar
prime — now WITH the gate-linearization leaf, so the `LCT` port is CLOSED.**

## ⚑ SAY THE SUBSTRATE OUT LOUD

**This is Lean-authored AIR.** Every op, every selector leg, every carry mask, every pin below is
authored here (program: `MinaFinalizeScalarsProg.lean`, same namespace) and lowered by
`EffectLower.lowerAir`. Rust parses the emitted descriptor, fills cells from the Lean-rendered
witness, and runs the deployed prover. It authors no constraint. House Law #1.

## THE OBJECT — a lowering, not new mathematics

`PicklesFinalize.finalizeOtherProof` is a four-way AND (`step.rs:876-884`):
`xi_correct && b_correct && combined_inner_product_correct && plonk_checks_passed`.
This descriptor renders conjuncts 3 and 4 whole: the Wrap-side `ft_eval0` (C5), the FULL
47-entry `combined_inner_product` ξ-fold (C8) with the in-AIR `ft_eval0` in slot 3,
`perm_scalars`, **and — new at v2 — `KimchiVerify.gateLinConst`'s six transcribed gate bodies,
whose closing eq gate forces the `LCT` claim block against the trace's own derivation.** 1046
sound field ops at the Pallas-scalar prime, one op per row, on the scheduled substrate
`PastaCurveScheduled`/`AirCrossRow`/`AirSelectorForcing`.

## ⚑⚑ v1 → v2: THE `LCT` PORT IS CLOSED, AND THE FALSIFIER IS NAMED

At v1 the linearization constant term was a PI-pinned PORT welded to NOTHING: `cipActualOf` is
affine in `LCT`, so the **`lct-shift`** adversarial trace — `LCT` bumped, the cip claim
recomputed — PROVED AND VERIFIED, a one-parameter family of accepting cip claims. Stage 11
(`MinaFinalizeScalarsProg` §2) derives `gateLinConst` in-AIR over the same 86 welded eval blocks
and eq-forces the claim, so **that exact family is now REFUSED by this descriptor's own gates**
(`circuit/tests/mina_finalize_scalars_proves.rs` §5 measures the refusal by name). `LCT` now
stands where `CIP_CLAIM`/`PERM_CLAIM` stand: a published claim compared against the trace's own
arithmetic.

## ⚑ WHAT THIS LEAF FORCES, AND WHERE EACH FORCING LIVES

Stated per conjunct, at this tree's resolution:

1. **Conjunct 3, `cipCorrect` — IN-AIR, whole** (this descriptor): `CIP_CLAIM ≡ cipR ξ r esZ
   esW` where `esZ`/`esW` are assembled from this trace's own input blocks, the `ft` slot is the
   in-AIR `ftEval0R` value (ζ-ladder, `zkPolyR`, the witnessed inverse forced by `den·DINV = 1`,
   both C5 folds), and the `LCT` its closing subtraction reads is FORCED by stage 11's eq gate
   to be `gateLinConst` of the same welded evals. No in-trace free input remains.
2. **Conjunct 4, `plonkChecksPassed` — IN-AIR, whole**: `PERM_CLAIM ≡ permScalarR` (upstream's
   comparison list is the literal `[perm]`, `plonk_checks.rs:363-366`).
3. **The eval inputs — AT THE FOLD, not here**: every `EZ_k`/`EW_k`/`FT1`/`PUBZ`/`PUBW` block is
   a PI-pinned PORT of this leaf; the recursion fold `cb.connect`s them elementwise to the
   phase-2 chain links' absorbed pairs. Until those connects run, this leaf's statement is "the
   ξ-fold and gate linearization of the blocks this claim names", not "of the block's
   transcript".
4. **The challenges — AT THE FOLD**: β/γ weld to `MinaPhase1Chain`'s squeezes (low-128 reads:
   in-leaf zero-pins on limbs 16..31); α, ζ, ξ, r weld to `dregg-mina-xi-endo-lift::v1`
   instances (the descriptor is challenge-independent; each instance is a witness/PI regen).
5. **The b-halves `BP0Z/BP1Z/BP0W/BP1W` — PORTS, never recomputed.** They weld to conjunction
   instances' published registers at the fold.
6. **`CIP_CLAIM`/`PERM_CLAIM`'s consumers — AT THE FOLD/HOST**: `CIP_CLAIM` connects to the
   conjunction's `CIP` block, `PERM_CLAIM` to the `f_comm` MSM's scalar lane. `LCT` has NO
   external consumer and needs none — it is forced in-trace.

## PORTS, in `SeamSpec` §4's sense: NONE — and that is a statement, not an omission

Every published block here is CONSUMED by gates — the evals by the folds AND the six gate
bodies, the challenges by the ladders, the claims (`CIP`, `PERM`, now `LCT` too) by eq
comparisons — so `portIslandFree` is FALSE of each and none is representable as a `PiPort`. The
external-forcing obligations are CLAIM-WELD obligations, `SeamSpec`-shaped, one per row of the
table above. **`LCT`'s row is GONE from that obligation list**: its weld is in-trace, this
descriptor's own eq gates, not a seam. No `proofBind` leg exists in this AIR, so no
`bound := none` seam is created here.

## THE SCHEDULE, THE REGISTER, AND WHAT IS REUSED

One op per row, 1046 ops, 2048-row trace (power of two, idle tail). A 1047-wide one-hot phase
register, `AirSelectorForcing`'s own register discipline at this size. Values live in 32-limb
slots allocated by `AirColumnAlloc.allocate` over the program's own live ranges (rendered by
`FsAllocRender.lean` — machine-spliced, never hand-typed: the v1 `hiTable` hand-paste with a
fabricated tail is the standing reason); slots are carried across rows by **complement-masked**
transition legs. The sound cores are `PastaCurveSound.mulCore/addSubCore` at `qLimb`, verbatim.

## WHAT IS PROVED HERE vs WHAT IS PENDING — read before citing

* PROVED (kernel): the layout facts — op count, table coverage, read coverage, same-slot
  disjointness (restated at v2 over the zipped tables — same fact, an O(n²) walk instead of an
  O(n³) `getD` scan the kernel cannot afford at 1177 values), width, committed width, constraint
  census, the quotient-constant and endo ring checks. PROVED (compiled, confessed at the
  statements): `mainRailOk`, `pinsTied`.
* PROVED in `MinaFinalizeScalarsWeld` (kernel): the real-block differential — the program's
  denotation on Mina devnet block 539508's own wire reproduces `proof.oracles(…)`'s
  `combined_inner_product`, o1-labs' own `perm_scalars`, AND the block's `linConstTerm`
  (`MinaRealBlockGate.LCT`), with the six selector bumps pinning program-vs-reference at six
  further points (each gate body's value isolated). ⚠ The GENERIC `progEval = reference` theorem
  is pending and named in the Prog file's §5 — the weld is a differential, not a proof about all
  inputs.
* ⚠ PENDING, NAMED: the trace-level forcing composition (this trace's rows + carries + phase
  register ⇒ the slot values ARE the denotation) is `AirCrossRow`'s walk at 1046 ops, NOT built
  here. Until it lands, this descriptor's polarity evidence is the deployed prover's refusal
  (real, measured in `circuit/tests/mina_finalize_scalars_proves.rs`), which is behavioural, not
  a proof — say it that way.

## Axiom hygiene

`#assert_axioms` on every named theorem; no `sorry`/`admit`; zero `#guard`s. ⚠ TWO theorems are
compiler-trusted and say so at their statements (`finalizeAir_mainRailOk`, `finalizeAir_pinsTied`
— `native_decide` + `#assert_compiled`, the `SeamSpec` §4 wall); everything else is kernel.

/-! ## §4 — THE SCHEDULE AS DATA, and the allocation.

⚑ **The allocation is MATERIALIZED as three literal tables**, not called at every use site. The
reason is kernel arithmetic, not taste: `slotOfF` appears inside every leg, and a `by decide`
that re-ran `AirColumnAlloc.allocate` (a huge fold at 1177 values × 1046 ops) per reference
would never terminate. The tables are the allocator's own answer — RENDERED by
`FsAllocRender.lean` and machine-spliced (never hand-typed); what the kernel then checks —
directly, cheaply, and about the object the legs actually use — are the three facts the layout
needs:

  * `the_ranges_cover_the_reads` — every op reads its sources inside their live windows and
    defines its value at its own row;
  * `same_slot_ranges_are_disjoint` — two values sharing a slot never overlap;
  * `the_tables_cover_the_values` — the tables span the value space and the slots fit.

Those three are what the forcing walk consumes; the allocator itself is tooling. -/

/-! ### The complement-masked carries.

A slot must carry its value across every transition EXCEPT the one that hands it to a new tenant.
The handover phases of slot `s` are `d − 1` for each value defined into `s` at row `d ≥ 1`; the
mask is `1 − Σ SEL(handovers)`, so the leg's size is the slot's TENANT count, not its live
length. On a live transition the mask reads 1 (`PhaseIndicator` + the handovers being elsewhere),
so `carried_constant` applies verbatim; on a handover it reads 0 and the slot is free. -/

/-- The rows at which slot `s` acquires a NEW tenant (the tenant's definition row), minus one:
the transitions the carry must NOT constrain. From the zipped literal tables (one structural
walk — the v1 indexed scan re-ran `getD` per value), so a leg build never runs the allocator. -/

/-! ## §9 — THE CENSUS, against the corrected numbers, and the two rail verdicts.

Declared **5 750** columns (1 047 selectors + 144 × 32 value slots + 95 witness pool), committed
**15 280** (`AirColumnAlloc.committedWidth`'s aux law over the pool legs), 64 324 constraints,
2 048 rows — the inner LDE at the descriptor engine (`log_blowup 6`) is `2^17`.

Scale, priced honestly against v1 (4 461 / 12 903 / 27 319 / 512): stage 11 added ZERO input
blocks — the PI surface stays 3 296; the 16 new blocks are `.first`-pinned constants — so this
delta is the ARITHMETIC's: +745 selector columns and +17 slots. Committed cells
15 280 × 2 048 ≈ 3.13 × 10⁷ ≈ 19 % of `MinaWrapVerifierAir.WRAP_CELLS = 161 308 368` (v1 was
4 %). ⚠ The brief's "~320 more ops" estimate for this leaf was 2.3× LOW (745 measured) — this
time the under-count was the constraint bodies' multiplies, not the pin surface; both failure
modes are now on record, price BOTH. -/

/-- ⚑ **THE COMPILER ACCEPTS EVERY LEG.** Window legs read `nxt` only under `.transition`, every
pool is `0 < bits ≤ 29`, and no leg is refused — the verdict `lowerAir` gates on.

⚠ **COMPILER-TRUSTED, and said out loud** (`native_decide` + `#assert_compiled`): the kernel
measurably cannot walk this leg list — the v1 verdict at 23 290 legs already re-instantiated the
list under the traversal lambdas past any whnf cache (21 min / 16 GiB / 3 % CPU before the
switch), and v2 is ~2.4× that. `SeamSpec` §4 records the wall; `PastaCurveScheduled`'s
kernel-decided twin of this verdict stands at 33 ops. -/
theorem finalizeAir_mainRailOk : finalizeAir.mainRailOk = true := by native_decide

/-- ⚑ **EVERY PUBLISHED COLUMN IS READ BY ANOTHER LEG** — each pinned block's columns appear in
its slot's pool leg, so a decorative pin is unrepresentable. Being read is not being forced; the
forcing claims live in the header table. ⚠ Compiler-trusted, same confession as above — the
inner `legs.any` rescan per pin is quadratic in exactly the terms the kernel cannot cache. -/
