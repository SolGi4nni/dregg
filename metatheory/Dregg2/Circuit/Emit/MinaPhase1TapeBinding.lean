# `Dregg2.Circuit.Emit.MinaPhase1TapeBinding` — **whose points**: the phase-1 tape's 53 elements,
decomposed, put on the curve, and welded to the objects that DETERMINE them.

## ⚑ SAY THE SUBSTRATE OUT LOUD

**This is Lean-authored AIR.** It authors no new constraint and emits no new descriptor: every wire
fact below is stated about `MinaPhase1Chain.chainPIs`, the public inputs the already-deployed
`dregg-pasta-fp-chainlink::v1` publishes. Rust parses that descriptor, fills trace cells, runs the
deployed prover and compares slices. House Law #1.

## ⚑⚑ THE HOLE THIS ADDRESSES, IN ITS AUTHOR'S WORDS

`MinaPhase1Chain` §8 residual 1, unrepaired since it was written:

> *"Nothing here says a `(x, y)` pair is on the curve, that `public_comm` commits to the 40-element
> public input, or that a `RecursionChallenge`'s `comm` is `⟨b_poly_coefficients(chals), G⟩`. Phase 1
> derives `fq_digest` FROM those coordinates; it does not authenticate them."*

⚑ **AND THE MEASURED SHAPE OF THE HOLE IS NOT WHAT THAT PARAGRAPH SAYS IT IS.** The tree already
CONTAINS the facts. `MinaWrapPublicCommGate.publicComm_is_the_transcript_preimage` derives
`PUBCOMM_XY` from the block's own 40-element public input and the SRS Lagrange basis, in the kernel,
and has done since rung 5e. `MinaWrapOpeningGate.opening_relation_holds` closes the IPA relation over
the 47-term aggregate of the block's commitments, in the kernel. What is missing is not a
derivation — it is a **WELD**: the block's commitments live in the tree as **two independently
hand-transcribed decimal lists** (`MinaRealBlockTranscript.{PREVCOMM,PUBCOMM,WCOMM,ZCOMM,TCOMM}_XY`
and `MinaWrapAggregationGate.COMBINE_POINTS`) with **no theorem saying they are the same points**,
and the chain publishes its 53 elements as free public-input felts that no consumer's fact reaches.

Two shapes that agree today are two shapes that will disagree later. §4 and §5 make them one object.

## ⚠⚠ WHAT THIS CHECK IS STRUCTURALLY INCAPABLE OF NOTICING — WRITTEN DOWN FIRST

`the_on_curve_check_cannot_see_provenance` is that sentence **as a theorem**, not as a comment: a
point that is on the Pallas curve and is *the wrong commitment* passes §3's on-curve leg in full,
26/26, with the substitution in place. An on-curve predicate answers *"is this a point"*; it cannot
answer *"is this THIS block's commitment"*, and the sibling cone paid months for the difference —
thirty-three wrap-transcript `lr` points were fifty SRS Lagrange bases cycled, and `onCurveQ` could
never have caught it **because cycled SRS bases are on-curve**.

⚑ So the strength of every binding below is exactly the strength of the object on its far side:

| tape elements | count | what determines them, in this tree | can an on-curve-and-wrong point survive? |
|---|---|---|---|
| `public_comm` `(x,y)` | 2 | the block's **40-element public input** + the SRS Lagrange basis (rung 5e) | **NO** — §4 |
| 2 prev, `z_comm`, 15 `w_comm` | 36 | the 47-term aggregate, hence `opening_relation_holds` | only if substituted in BOTH lists — §5, §7 |
| 7 `t_comm` chunks | 14 | `ft_comm` (aggregate slot 3) — **not welded here** | **YES**, residual 2 |
| verifier-index digest | 1 | the Wrap VK — **not derived anywhere** | **YES**, residual 1 |

## WHAT IS AND IS NOT ESTABLISHED

  * **Kernel-clean and general in the link:** `the_wire_lane0` / `the_wire_lane1` — the 32 felts the
    deployed descriptor publishes at PI slots `[6·SK, 7·SK)` and `[7·SK, 8·SK)` ARE the absorbed
    pair's limbs, at every `j`, by `rfl`. No evaluation, no permutation run.
  * **Kernel, this block:** the shape, the on-curve leg, the blind-spot theorem, the aggregate weld,
    and `the_tape_public_comm_is_the_msm_of_the_public_input` (which is rung 5e's own theorem
    rewritten, not a second `decide` over the same 40 ladders).
  * **Compiler-trusted, said out loud:** the pairing census and the two forgery poles that run the
    27-permutation chain.
  * **NOT established:** the verifier-index digest, and the 7 `t_comm` chunks' tie to `ft_comm`.
    Both are named with a number in §8.

⚑ **PROVENANCE, AT SOURCE.** Every number below is a hand transcription of

`phase1_t_comm_xy`), emitted by `metatheory/fixtures/pickles-extractors/src/main.rs` `fn transcript`
(`:958-1170`) off the committed fixture `mina_devnet_block.json` — Mina devnet block **539508**,
`state_hash 3NLmVB6Fs3dm4kXNkgwheHXzJXNpCCwEDe76RpTVeBTNujm12zNk`. `main.rs:931-939`'s `xy_of` is
`absorb_g`'s own order: **`x` then `y`, as WHOLE base-field elements** — the tape is 53 `Fp`
elements and not one bit is packed. Nothing is emitted until `BlockVerifier::make()` (`:276`),
`accumulator_check` (`:284-289`) and `kimchi::verifier::verify == Ok(())` (`:343-356`) have all
passed, and `:1041-1045` asserts the FLAT coordinate tape reproduces the structured
`absorb_commitment` run.

⚠ **AND THE TRANSCRIPTION IS BY HAND.** No generator writes these literals and, until the Rust leg
this file ships with, nothing diffed them against the JSON. That is a provenance gap in its own
right and it is closed by `mina_phase1_tape_binding_proves.rs` §1, which compares the EMITTED WIRE
against the extractor's JSON — the emitter, not the source text, so a mistyped digit reds. -/

/-! ## §5 — ⚑⚑ THE BINDING THAT FORCES IDENTITY: `public_comm` IS THE MSM OF THE PUBLIC INPUT.

This is the one tape point whose value is **computed from the block's statement** rather than read
off the block's proof, so it is the one place an on-curve-and-wrong substitution is refused outright
rather than merely propagated. `MinaWrapPublicCommGate.publicComm` is
`Σ_{i<40} (−publicᵢ)·Lᵢ + 1·srs.h` over openmina's own `PreparedStatement::to_public_input` — the
protocol-state hash, the two `messages_for_next_*_proof` digests and the deferred values.

rewrites its theorem onto §1's decomposition and onto the wire, so the two rungs compose instead of
re-deciding. -/

`MinaWrapOpeningGate.opening_relation_holds` closes the IPA relation over. Until this section the
two lists were two hand transcriptions that happened to agree; nothing said so, and a one-digit drift
in either would have left both files green, the transcript sampling challenges from one set of
commitments while the opening argument opened another. -/

/-! ## §8 — RESIDUALS, NAMED WITH NUMBERS.

⚑ **1. THE VERIFIER-INDEX DIGEST IS STILL AN INPUT — 1 tape element, 254 bits, and the number that
closes it is 28.** `VKDIGEST` is `index.digest::<EFqSponge>()` of the devnet blockchain Wrap VK
(`verifier_index.rs:399-450`) — itself an Fp sponge over that VK's own commitments. It appears in
the tree as a bare constant in **two** places (`MinaRealBlockTranscript.VKDIGEST` and
`bridge/src/mina_opening_check.rs`'s `WRAP_VK_DIGEST`) and is **recomputed from nothing**, although
the VK it digests IS committed and sha256-pinned
(`bridge/mina-zkapp/fixtures/mina-devnet-wrap-blockchain-vk.json`, pinned at
`mina-canonical-circuit-oracle.mjs:190`). That VK carries 7 `sigma_comm` + 15 `coefficients_comm` +
6 selector commitments = **28 points = 56 coordinates**, which `pairsOf` chunks into **28 links of
`dregg-pasta-fp-chainlink::v1` — the same descriptor, no new AIR** — whose 28th outgoing lane would
weld to flat slot 0 by the same 32-felt elementwise comparison §5 uses. Until then a wrong VK digest
produces a complete, self-consistent, entirely wrong challenge vector, and **nothing downstream can
tell**: it is the largest trusted object under this story.

⚑ **2. THE 7 `t_comm` CHUNKS ARE NOT WELDED — 14 of the 52 coordinates.** They reach the aggregate
only through `ft_comm` (slot 3), which `MinaWrapGroupGate.ftComm` builds and
`MinaWrapAggregationGate.combine_slot_3_is_our_ftComm` ties to the aggregate — but no theorem here
says the 7 chunks the TAPE absorbs are the 7 that `ftComm` consumed. An on-curve-and-wrong `t_comm`
chunk survives everything in this file. That weld is `ftComm`'s own shape and is the obvious next
rung.

⚑ **3. THE 36 COORDINATES OF §6 ARE BOUND ONLY AGAINST A SECOND LIST.** The prev-challenge, `z_comm`
and `w_comm` points are forced to be the aggregate's — and the aggregate's opening holds — but
`COMBINE_POINTS` is itself a transcription of the same proof. A forger who substitutes an
on-curve-and-wrong point **in both lists** is refused by `opening_relation_holds` and by nothing
here; and `opening_relation_holds` inherits P10, the IPA `msm == 0` opening-soundness floor, which
is **unmoved**. The two prev-challenge commitments have a stronger determinant that is not built:
`accumulator_check`'s `comm = ⟨b_poly_coefficients(chals), srs.g⟩`, a **2^15 = 32 768-term MSM** per
commitment against `MinaWrapSrsG.SRS_G` — the reason it is named rather than done.

⚑ **4. NOTHING HERE IS AN IN-AIR CURVE GATE.** §3 is a kernel `decide` over the emitted constants,
not `PastaMsmOnCurve.onCurveGates` instantiated on the tape. The 8-constraint forced gate exists and
this file does not use it; wiring it would cost 26 × 135 columns and is the cheapest remaining rung.

⚑ **5. AND §5's FAR SIDE IS A KERNEL MSM, NOT A CIRCUIT.** `publicComm` is 40 × 255-bit ladders by
`decide`. The wire equality is real and elementwise, but what it welds the wire TO is a
kernel-evaluated constant, not a second proved instance. `MinaWrapXiAggregateMsm` is what a
circuit-side public-comm MSM would look like; it does not exist for the Lagrange basis.
