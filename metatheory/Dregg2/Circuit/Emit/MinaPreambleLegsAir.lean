# `Dregg2.Circuit.Emit.MinaPreambleLegsAir` — **FIVE PREAMBLE LEGS STOP BEING A DECISION THE
OBSERVER CALLS AND BECOME EMITTED POLYNOMIALS.**

⚑ SUBSTRATE, SAID OUT LOUD (House Law #1): this is a **Lean-authored AIR**. `preambleDesc` is
`EffectLower.lowerTiedAir` applied to the `EffectAir` source `preambleAir` (§3). There is **no
hand-written `VmConstraint2` in this file** and Rust authors nothing; Rust proves the artifact
(`circuit/tests/mina_preamble_legs_proves.rs`).

## ⚑⚑ THE STATE THIS MOVES, in the audit's own words

`docs/PICKLES-VERIFY-BLOCK-LEG-TABLE.md` §6, 2026-08-08: *"How many of upstream's legs does dregg
close BY CONSTRAINT? **Zero**, at every layer this table covers. No AIR row forces any leg of
`verify_block`."* The strongest closures were CODEC and CONSUMER REFUSAL — the node evaluates
compiled Lean (`picklesWrapShapeOk` → `dregg_mina_wrap_shape_ok`) and refuses the block. Real, on
the deployed path, and **not what "closed by constraint" means.**

This file renders the legs whose arithmetic is already proven in
`Circuit.Emit.PicklesVerifyPreamble` as one emitted descriptor, `dregg-mina-preamble-legs::v1`:

| leg | upstream | the emitted polynomial |
|---|---|---|
| **B1** `non_chunking` (wire max) | `verification.rs:628` | `MAXLEN·(MAXLEN−1) = 0` — the summary is a bit, and `maxPairLen_le_one_iff_nonChunking` proves the bit decides EXACTLY the list predicate |
| **B1** non-empty walk | `nonChunking_nil`'s vacuous accept | `PAIR_COUNT·PAIR_INV − 1 = 0` — zero has no inverse, so an empty walk has NO satisfying row |
| **B3** step domain ≤ 16 | `verification.rs:648-651` | `DOMAIN_LOG2 + Σ 2ⁱ·SBITᵢ − 16 = 0` with all bits boolean — a slack decomposition, so `> 16` has NO satisfying row over the canonical range |
| **C3** packing length | `prepared_statement.rs:179` | `PUB_LEN − 24 − N_CHAL = 0` — the produced length is COMPUTED from the challenge count, in-constraint |
| **D1a** prev-challenge count | `verifier.rs:810-815` | `PROOF_PREV − IDX_PREV = 0` |
| **D1b** public-input length | `verifier.rs:816-820` | `PUB_LEN − IDX_PUBLIC = 0` — ⚑ **the equality the vacuous `decide (0 < publicLen)` never was** |

⚑ **D1b is the marquee.** `KimchiVerify.shapeOkRec`'s public-input conjunct compared trusted
config against zero and could not fail (`the_old_public_conjunct_could_not_fail_on_this_path`);
`PicklesWrapShapeGate.the_old_gate_admits_a_public_input_it_should_refuse` exhibits the 41-word
index it accepted, and `MinaWrapVkDigestChain.the_index_digest_cannot_see_the_circuit_shape`
proves the VK digest cannot separate that pair either. The consumer-refusal repair
(`preambleLegsOk`, 2026-08-08) made the equality a compiled decision; **this file makes it a
polynomial**: `the_41_word_index_has_no_accepted_row` is that NO row of this AIR — not one forged
fixture, any row — carries `N_CHAL = 16` against `IDX_PUBLIC = 41`.

## ⚑ WHERE EACH FORCING LIVES — said per leg, because a theorem can be true about the wrong object

* **AIR** (this file): the RELATIONS. Booleanity, the three bit decompositions, the slack sum,
  the two equalities, the schedule sum, the inverse gate — every one an emitted constraint a
  prover cannot satisfy on a violating row, refused by the deployed constraint system with no
  producer pre-flight, no table, no lookup.
* **HOST** (stated, not hidden): the BINDING of the eight published slots to the real wire —
  `mina_pickles::WrapProofShape`'s `bulletproof_challenge_count` / `prev_eval_pairs` /
  `prev_eval_max_len` / `branch_domain_log2` and `MinaWrapIndexParams::DEVNET_BLOCKCHAIN`'s
  `public_len` / `prev_challenges`. Whoever verifies a proof of this descriptor supplies those
  eight numbers as the PI vector, exactly as the compiled gate is handed them today. Publication
  is what makes a future fold weld REACHABLE (`air_public_targets`), same as
  `MinaBodyPreimageBitsAir`'s 302 limbs; until that fold exists the slot-to-wire tie is the
  verifying host's.
* **SEAM**: none. No `proofBind` here — a `bound := none` bind emits ZERO polynomials over its
  commit lanes (`descriptor_ir2.rs:4017`) and a sibling is repairing that class; this file does
  not add another.

## ⚠ WHAT THIS DOES NOT MOVE

* **B2, D2 stay CODEC** — the wire admits no encoding of a violation. That closure is real and
  stronger than a runtime compare; rebuilding it here would be checking what the type forces.
* **C2's digest and C3's 40 word VALUES stay VALUE LAYER** — 16 Fq absorb links of the shape
  `MinaWrapVkDigestChain` runs at 28, undone work, not touched by this file.
* **The mod-`p` envelope**: the emitted gates force congruences at BabyBear (`PMOD`); the ℤ-level
  readings below are exact for canonical rows, which is what the deployed prover commits. Same
  envelope every descriptor in this tree carries (`EffectLowerCore.eq_of_modEq_canon`).

## Layout — ONE ROW, eight published slots, and the row is the preamble tuple

    col 0  PROOF_PREV   the proof's prev-challenge count        → PI 0
    col 1  IDX_PREV     the index's declared `prev_challenges`  → PI 1
    col 2  N_CHAL       `bulletproof_challenges.len()`          → PI 2
    col 3  PUB_LEN      the packing length `to_public_input` produces → PI 3
    col 4  IDX_PUBLIC   the index's declared `public`           → PI 4
    col 5  DOMAIN_LOG2  `branch_data.domain_log2`               → PI 5
    col 6  MAXLEN       max `prev_evals` pair length            → PI 6
    col 7  PAIR_COUNT   `prev_evals` pairs yielded              → PI 7
    col 8  PAIR_INV     witness: PAIR_COUNT⁻¹ mod p (unpublished)
    col 9..13   NBIT i  bits of N_CHAL       (5 → N_CHAL < 32)
    col 14..18  DBIT i  bits of DOMAIN_LOG2  (5 → DOMAIN_LOG2 < 32)
    col 19..23  SBIT i  bits of 16 − DOMAIN_LOG2 (the B3 slack)
    col 24..29  CBIT i  bits of PAIR_COUNT   (6 → PAIR_COUNT < 64)

## ⚑ COMMITTED WIDTH, RE-DERIVED FOR THIS SHAPE

These legs are field-only — booleanity, affine sums, one two-column product. **No curve ops**, so
neither the scheduled row's 4.60× leaf blow-up nor the 6.6× wrap figure applies; there is nothing
to inherit. NO table, NO range lookup (`preambleAir_has_no_lookups`), so `MainLayout::build`
appends no nibble aux block: **30 declared, 30 committed, 1.00×**
(`the_committed_width_is_the_declared_width`, re-derived from the emitted bytes in the Rust §0).

## ⚑ WHAT THIS BREAKS (flag day, stated so it is findable)

**2026-08-08 — A NEW DESCRIPTOR, `dregg-mina-preamble-legs::v1`.** Nothing existing changes
shape. It emits `circuit/descriptors/by-name/dregg-mina-preamble-legs-v1.json` and MINTS a VK for
it; no VK rotates, nothing re-genesises, and `PROVENANCE.json` gains no row that this file stamps
— the stamp is the operator's ceremony.

/-! ### The falsifiers. Every target carries a NON-ZERO honest value, every mutation MOVES it,
and every mutated value is a valid BabyBear element — and since this AIR has no range table, no
refusal below can be a lookup's; each is the named window gate's. Where a mutation must also move
a published slot or a decomposition bit to isolate the refusing gate, it does, and the theorem
says which gate is left refusing. -/

/-! ## §7 — ⚠ RESIDUALS, NAMED.

1. ⚑⚑ **THE SLOT-TO-WIRE BINDING IS THE HOST'S.** The eight slots are PUBLISHED, which is what
   makes a weld reachable; until a fold `cb.connect`s them to the wire the observer decodes, the
   party that verifies a proof of this descriptor supplies the eight numbers — the same position
   `MinaBodyPreimageBitsAir`'s 302 limbs are in. **A prover chooses the tuple; this AIR says the
   tuple satisfies the five legs.** The compiled gate (`picklesWrapShapeOk`) keeps running on the
   deployed path unchanged; this descriptor is the same verdict as polynomials, for any consumer
   that will not run our process.
2. ⚠ **THE OTHER PREAMBLE CONJUNCTS.** `shapeOkRec`'s column/permutation counts, D3's
   `t_comm` bound, D4's chunk-size pin: still consumer refusal. B2/D2: CODEC, deliberately not
   rebuilt here. C2's digest, C3's 40 word values: value layer, undone.
3. ⚠ **THE MOD-`p` ENVELOPE.** The emitted gates are congruences at BabyBear; §5's ℤ readings
   are exact for canonical rows, which the deployed prover commits.
4. ⚠ **THE RECURSION BOUNDARY.** That a verifying STARK implies its statement is the FRI
   obligation this whole stack carries; this rung stands at that resolution.
