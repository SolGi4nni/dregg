# `Dregg2.Circuit.Emit.MinaWrapClosingScheduled` — ⚑⚑ THE IPA CLOSING CHECK ON THE SCHEDULED ROW:
**10 799 → 1 500 COMMITTED COLUMNS.**

## ⚑ SAY THE SUBSTRATE OUT LOUD (HOUSE LAW #1, at constraint #1)

**This is Lean-authored AIR.** Every value column here is COMPUTED BY THE ALLOCATOR
(`AirColumnAlloc.allocate` through `PastaCurveScheduled.valueCol`), not written by hand and not
written in Rust. The only hand-chosen index in the file is `GO`, one column past the scheduled
block, and it is `SCHED_W` rather than a literal.

## ⚑ WHAT WAS BLOCKING THIS, IN ITS AUTHOR'S OWN WORDS

`MinaWrapClosingAir` rides `PastaCurveSound`'s 3 048-column row, one complete-add per row. Putting
it on `PastaCurveScheduled`'s 481-column row was named as blocked precisely:

> the scheduled layout is one op per row behind a **33-phase shift register**, so a chain needs a
> **phase-gated carry** plus a re-run of `AirCrossRow`'s composition.

Both are here. §2 is the phase-gated carry; §5 composes `AirSelectorForcing`'s per-block forcing.

## ⚑⚑ THE THREE THINGS THE REGISTER HAD TO LEARN, AND WHY EACH IS FORCED

`PastaCurveScheduled.selShiftLegs` is a **one-shot** register: `nxt(s₀) = 0` on every transition, so
phase 0 never returns and the block runs exactly once. A chain needs it to cycle. Three changes,
and only three:

1. **`nxt(s₀) = loc(s₃₂)·loc(GO)`** — phase 0 returns after phase 32 exactly when the chain
   continues. `GO` is one boolean column. ⚑ Degree 2, so the main-rail budget of 3 is untouched:
   the op gates are already the degree-3 term and nothing here reaches past them.
2. **`nxt(s₃₃) = loc(s₃₃) + loc(s₃₂)·(1 − loc(GO))`** — the idle phase absorbs when the chain
   stops. ⚑ **The idle state is absorbing on its own**, with no monotonicity leg on `GO`: at an idle
   row `loc(s₃₂) = 0`, so `nxt(s₀) = 0` and `nxt(s₃₃) = loc(s₃₃)` whatever `GO` does. A `GO` that
   came back up could not restart the register, so no leg is spent forbidding it.
3. ⚑⚑ **`.last`: `s₃₃ = 1` — THE LAST ROW IS IDLE.** This is not tidiness and it is the seam the
   one-row file names: *"an off-by-one silently drops the final addend."* Without it a prover picks
   a height whose last row is phase 32, the block's OUTPUT has not been threaded into the
   accumulator yet, and the discharge reads the accumulator ENTERING the last block — so the last
   addend is silently dropped and every count still passes. With it, `GO` must have fallen at a
   phase-32 row, a whole number of blocks ran, and the final block's output IS in the accumulator.

⚠ `prove_vm_descriptor2` refuses a non-power-of-two trace height (`descriptor_ir2.rs:7102`, read at
source), and no power of two is a multiple of 33 (`33 = 3·11`, coprime to 2). So an idle tail is
not optional and a purely cyclic 33-register could never close. That is *why* `GO` exists.

## ⚑⚑ THE CARRY LEGS DID NOT HAVE TO CHANGE, AND THAT IS THE MEASUREMENT

`PastaCurveScheduled.carryLegs` masks each slot by `Σ_{t ∈ carryPhases k} SEL t`. Under the cyclic
register `SEL t` reads `1` at every row `≡ t (mod 33)`, so **the same 352 legs hold every slot
across exactly the transitions inside every block's live ranges** — one authored block, N blocks of
force. And `no_slot_carries_across_the_block_boundary` is the fact that makes the handover legal:
**32 is in no slot's `carryPhases`** (the maximum is 31), so at the phase-32 transition no value
column is held and the thread is free to write. A single slot that carried across `t = 32` would
fight the thread and refuse the honest witness.

## ⚑⚑ WHERE THE ACCUMULATOR LIVES — the choice that costs zero columns

The accumulator is threaded into **the input slots the allocator already gave value ids 0/1/2**, not
into a fresh register. `the_scheduled_roles_are_the_allocators_columns` reads them off `valueCol`.
So the chain state costs **no new columns at all**, and the idle tail holds those three blocks
(`idleHoldLegs`) while everything else goes quiet.

⚠ **`OUT_X` AND THE ADDEND'S `X` SHARE A SLOT** — `valueCol (V 26) = valueCol 3 = 290`, because the
allocator reused slot 8 after the addend's last use at row 14. That is legal *inside* a block and it
is exactly the kind of coincidence that would be a silent aliasing bug across the boundary, so it is
pinned rather than trusted: the thread READS 290 at phase 32 (where slot 8 holds `V 26`) and the
next block's addend WRITES it at phases 0-14, and no carry leg spans the gap.

## ⚑ WHAT THIS COSTS — measured on the EMITTED descriptors, in §4

| | declared | committed | constraints |
|---|---|---|---|
| `pallasCompleteAddSoundAir` — the row all three closing descriptors ride | 3 048 | **10 756** | 4 476 |
| `dregg-mina-wrap-closing-final::v1` | 3 048 | 10 756 | 4 828 |
| `dregg-mina-wrap-closing-fs::v1` | 3 091 | 10 799 | 4 961 |
| `dregg-mina-wrap-closing-scheduled-final::v1` | **482** | **1 500** | **2 747** |

⚑ **THE THEOREMS COMPARE AGAINST THE ROW, NOT AGAINST THE CHAIN WRAPPER, AND THAT IS THE RIGHT
OBJECT.** `closingSegAir`/`closingFinalAir`/`closingFsAirOn` add threads, pins, a discharge and a
transcript weld — **none of which declares a range lookup**, so all three commit
`pallasCompleteAddSoundAir`'s 7 708 aux columns and differ only in DECLARED width (+0, +0, +43). A
width claim keyed to the wrapper would move when a pin moved; keyed to the row it does not. The two
wrapper rows above are measured, not theorems of this file.

⚠ **AND THE TRADE, BOTH HALVES, BECAUSE ONE HALF IS A LIE.** A complete addition costs **1 row**
on the deployed row and **33 rows** here. So per addition:

* **committed CELLS go UP** — `1 × 10 756 = 10 756` against `33 × 1 500 = 49 500`, a factor of
  **4.60× MORE** work for the LEAF prover (`the_leaf_prover_pays_more_per_addition`);
* **the WRAP's per-query column work goes DOWN 7.17×**, because an in-circuit FRI verifier opens
  `Q · W` committed cells per round and `W` is the committed WIDTH;
* **the Merkle path grows by `log₂ 33 = 6` bits per block**, so the wrap pays `Q · 6` extra
  compressions per commitment round.

Quoting only the 7.17× is the flattering half of a pair. The honest sentence is: **this moves work
from the wrap into the leaf**, and it is worth it only because the wrap is the expensive one — the
verification circuit is ~10³ times larger than the descriptor it verifies.

⚠ **RE-DERIVE THE LDE, DO NOT INHERIT IT.** Since the FRI split
(`recursion-verify/src/config.rs:571`, `recursion_layer_over`) a layer VERIFIES at its child's mint
knobs and MINTS at `RECURSION_FRI_LOG_BLOWUP = 3`. The child descriptor proof is still minted at
`IR2_INNER_LOG_BLOWUP = 6`, so `log₂|D⁰|` of the object the wrap OPENS is `log₂(height) + 6` —
6 → 12 for a single block, and `log₂(64N) + 6` for a chain of `N` blocks against `log₂(N) + 6` on
the deployed row. The wrap's OWN LDE is at blowup 3, not 6. ⚠ Any figure computed from a named
config constant instead of `recursion_layer_over(child)` is measuring a config the tower no longer
runs.

## ⚠ WHAT IS PROVED HERE AND WHAT IS NOT — read this before quoting a number

* `closingSchedFinalAir_mainRailOk` / `_pinsTied` — the compiler accepts the block and no pin is
  decorative. Not a formality: a `.all` window reading `nxt`, or a `limbs` leg at width ≥ 30, emits
  `refuseConstraints` instead.
* `closingSchedFinalDesc_certified` — `CertifiedRefines`, per-leg, in the source's own
  `AirLeg.forces` vocabulary.
* `closingSchedFinalDesc_width` / `_committed` / `_constraint_count` and the censuses — on the
  EMITTED objects.
* `no_slot_carries_across_the_block_boundary`, `chain_phase_zero_returns` against
  `the_one_shot_register_kills_phase_zero`, and `chain_last_row_is_idle` — the three facts the
  design turns on, stated as what the legs FORCE rather than as syntactic pins.
* `oneBlockRows_force_the_rcb_formula` — **one block's** rows force the RCB formula, composed from
  `AirSelectorForcing`. ⚠ It is stated for the FIRST block (rows 0-32), where the phase register's
  reading is `AirCrossRow.PhaseIndicator` unchanged.

⚠⚠ **WHAT IS NOT PROVED, NAMED AS UNDONE WORK RATHER THAN WORN AS A CAVEAT.** The CHAIN-level
forcing — `closing_discharge_forced`'s analogue, "`N` blocks plus the discharge force the `N`-fold
RCB chain to be the point at infinity" — is **not here.** It needs `PhaseIndicator` generalised from
`[i = t]` to `[i = t mod 33]` under `GO`, which is the same induction as
`AirSelectorForcing.phaseIndicator_of_selectorLegs` with a second case at the boundary, and then
`AirCrossRow`'s `gather` re-based per block. That is ordinary work of a known shape; it is not a
theorem of the model and it is not small. **Until it lands, this file is a WIDTH and SHAPE result
plus per-block forcing — quote it that way and do not say the scheduled closing check is forced.**

⚠ **P10, the opening-soundness floor, is untouched**, as in the one-row file: that a prover which
passes the closing check must KNOW an opening is the IPA/dlog extraction argument, undischarged here
and everywhere in this stack.

⚠ **Which object.** Everything is about the HAND schedule `AirColumnAlloc.rcbOpsScheduled` through
`PastaCurveScheduled.rcbSchedule` — the emitted one. **NOT** `AirSchedule.rcbOpsOptimal`, whose
1 307 committed columns are a width result no forcing theorem mentions; re-pointing at it moves
`carryPhases`, `loOf`/`hiOf` and every `by decide` in this file.

A width ratio quoted alone is the flattering member of a pair. One complete addition is **1 row** on

the honest claim is that this moves work from the wrap into the leaf. -/

/-- ⚑ **AND THE MERKLE PATH GROWS BY `log₂ 33 = 6` BITS PER BLOCK.** `2⁵ < 33 ≤ 2⁶`, so a block that
was one row is six rounds of a Merkle path deeper — the depth an in-circuit FRI verifier pays `Q`
compressions for, per commitment round. Stated on the row count rather than on a config constant,
because the blowup that multiplies it is `recursion_layer_over`'s business and not this file's. -/

/-! ## §5 — ⚑⚑ ONE BLOCK'S ROWS FORCE THE RCB FORMULA — the re-run of `AirCrossRow`'s composition.

The blocker named *"a re-run of `AirCrossRow`'s composition"* and this is it. The cyclic register is
NOT the one `AirSelectorForcing.phaseIndicator_of_selectorLegs` was proved against, so the induction
is reused through `phaseIndicator_of_phaseFacts` — which takes the six FACTS rather than one leg
list, and hands the `nxt(s₀)` and idle facts `tr t 32 ≡ 0`. That hypothesis is exactly what collapses
`nxt(s₀) ≡ loc(s₃₂)·loc(GO)` to `nxt(s₀) ≡ 0` over the first block, and it is why one induction
serves both registers instead of two copies drifting apart.

⚠ **FIRST BLOCK ONLY.** See the header: the chain-level statement is undone work, not a caveat. -/
