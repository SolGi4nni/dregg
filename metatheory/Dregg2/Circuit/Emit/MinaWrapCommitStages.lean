# `Dregg2.Circuit.Emit.MinaWrapCommitStages` — the COMMITMENT-COMBINATION stages of Kimchi's
`verify`, as emitted dregg AIRs over a REAL Mina devnet block.

## ⚑ SAY THE SUBSTRATE OUT LOUD

**This is Lean-authored AIR.** Every stage below is a `List Instr` over
`MinaWrapCommitMachine`'s Lean-authored machine, lowered by `EffectLower.lowerAir`. There is no
hand-written `VmConstraint2` and no Rust-authored gadget anywhere in this cone. Rust parses the
emitted descriptor, fills cells, and runs the deployed prover. House Law #1.

## THE FOUR STAGES, AND WHERE THEIR NUMBERS COME FROM

`kimchi/src/verifier.rs` on a Wrap verifier index (no lookup index, no optional gate commitments):

  * **`public_comm`** (`verifier.rs:834-857`) — `PolyComm::multi_scalar_mul(lagrange_bases,
    −public_input)`, then `mask_custom` with all-ones blinders, i.e. one further `+ H`.
    **41 nominal, 31 meaningful**: ten of the block's forty public inputs are ZERO, and a zero
    scalar makes the term the point at infinity, which an affine term list cannot carry (§6b).
  * **`f_comm`** (`verifier.rs:904-953`) — `sigma_comm[PERMUTS−1]` at `perm_scalars`, plus one term
    per `linearization.index_terms`; that list is **empty** on the wrap side, so **1 term**.
  * **`ft_comm`** (`verifier.rs:958-964`) — `chunk(f_comm, ζ^srs_len) − chunk(t_comm, ζ^srs_len) ·
    (ζ^n − 1)`. **9 nominal, 7 meaningful.**
  * **the ξ-aggregate** (`poly-commitment/src/commitment.rs:724-744`, `combine_commitments`) —
    `Σᵢ polyscale^i · Cᵢ` over 2 recursion + `public_comm` + `ft_comm` + `Z` + 6 index + 15 witness
    + 15 coefficient + 6 sigma = **47 terms** at `COLUMNS = 15`, `PERMUTS = 7`.

⚑ **THE DATA IS REAL.** Every base point, every challenge and every golden output below comes from
`MinaWrapGroupGate` / `MinaWrapAggregationGate` / `MinaWrapPublicCommGate`, which carry Mina devnet
block **539508** and are `by decide`-checked against o1-labs' own `PolyComm::multi_scalar_mul`
output. This file adds no new constants; it CHECKS those constants with an AIR.

## ⚑ THE HONEST SPLIT — read this before reading any green

A commitment combination is `Σ sᵢ · Bᵢ`. Three separable obligations, and this file emits a
descriptor for each rather than one descriptor that quietly does two of them:

  1. **THE SCALARS.** `s_i` must be what the transcript says, not what the prover likes.
     `xiChainProg` computes all 47 powers of the block's REAL `ξ` in-circuit, from `ξ` as a public
     input, in 46 Pasta multiplies. **Full fidelity, no reduction.**
  2. **THE GROUP ACCUMULATION AND THE SCALAR↔BASE PAIRING.** `sumProg` folds the stage's term list
     with the affine chord law, one ROM-pinned base per instruction, at the stage's FULL term count
     (40 / 1 / 9 / 47) — against the block's own golden aggregate.
  3. **THE SCALAR MULTIPLICATION `sᵢ · Bᵢ` ITSELF.** `msmProg` is the double-and-add ladder with an
     in-circuit bit decomposition and a closing `SC = s` assertion. It is emitted at a REDUCED plane
     count (§7) because the full 255 planes are `9 456` instructions per term and the trace does not
     fit a checked-in fixture — `full_width_ladder_price` is that as a theorem, not an excuse.

⚠ So: obligation (2) is emitted at full term count over PRE-SCALED points, which means the emitted
`sumProg` instances take `sᵢ·Bᵢ` as given. That is exactly what obligation (3) supplies and exactly
what is NOT closed at full width **on this machine**. Nothing in THIS FILE should be read as "the
ξ-aggregate is verified in-AIR". What is true here is: *the scalar vector is computed in-AIR at full
fidelity; the 47-term group fold is computed in-AIR at full term count; the 255-plane scalar
multiplication that joins them is demonstrated at 8 planes and priced at 255.*

⚑ **AND THE ξ-AGGREGATE'S OBLIGATION (3) IS NOW CLOSED ELSEWHERE, AT FULL WIDTH.**
`Dregg2.Circuit.Emit.MinaWrapXiAggregateMsm` emits the same 47-term aggregate on
`PastaMsmBucketed`'s fused running-sum layout: the scalars enter as NUMBERS, the generators enter
UNSCALED, and `T_COVER`'s permutation makes `sᵢ·Bᵢ` the trace's own work at `nbits = 255`, in 8 192
rows. That descriptor — not this one — is what may be cited for "the ξ-aggregate scales in-circuit".
⚠ It buys that at a real price, named in its header and not to be absorbed: its rows are denominated
in the **unsound `fpMulCore`**, where every descriptor in THIS file is `PastaFieldSound`.

## ⚑ INCOMPLETE ADDITION, NAMED

`addAffine` is the chord law with a WITNESSED slope pinned by `s·(x₁−x₂) = y₁−y₂` — Kimchi's own
`CompleteAdd` gate minus the `same_x` branch, i.e. Pickles' `add_fast` in its non-exceptional case.
At `x₁ = x₂` no slope satisfies the pin, so **no witness exists and the prover cannot produce a
trace**: this is a COMPLETENESS gap (a trace that ought to exist does not), never a soundness gap
(a trace that ought not to exist is accepted). `dblAffine` carries the tangent branch. The ladder
uses a fixed non-identity OFFSET so the accumulator never reaches the point at infinity, which the
affine coordinates cannot represent — `offset_is_a_real_pallas_point`.

## Axiom hygiene

`#assert_axioms`-clean (⊆ {propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}); no `sorry`/`admit`/
`native_decide`. Facts are NAMED THEOREMS — this file adds zero `#guard`s.

⚑ 46 multiplies. `ξ` is a public input on the first row; `ξ⁴⁶` is a public input on the last. Every

`i < 64`, so those six values are all the ξ-aggregate's 47 scalars need — **six wire values, not
forty-seven.** Six `addR` copies keep them alive to the last row, where the widened pin publishes
them.

⚠ **The registers are the LADDER's, and they are idle here.** `xiChainProg` writes only `ZERO`,
`TX` and `TY`; `AX … T1` are live in `ladderProg`'s inner loop and in no instruction of this one.
Reusing them is what keeps the basis inside `NREG = 12` with no machine change. -/

/-! ### ⚑ THE IDENTITY CANNOT RIDE IN AN AFFINE TERM LIST — found 2026-08-05, on the wire.

TEN of the block's forty public inputs are **zero**. `smul 0 P` is the point at infinity, and
`toAff` reads it as `(0, 0)` — because `finv 0 = 0`, not because `(0,0)` means anything. `(0,0)` is
**not on Pallas**, and folding it with `addAffine` takes the running total OFF THE CURVE.

⚑ **The 41-term fold reached o1-labs' `public_comm` ANYWAY, and only because ten is EVEN.** Adding
`(0,0)` twice is the identity map, so the ten pseudo-points cancel in pairs and the accumulator
returns to the curve. With an odd count the answer is simply WRONG. That is a correct result
standing on a parity coincidence in one block's public inputs, and the theorems below are what
replace the coincidence: the identity terms are DROPPED, and the fold is over the 31 that carry a
non-zero scalar.

This is the same "nominal vs meaningful" split `FT_TERMS` already carries (9 nominal / 7 meaningful),
now forced by the data rather than by the shape of `verifier.rs`. -/

/-! ### §6c — ⚑ THE WELD TO o1-LABS, AS NAMED THEOREMS.

Until now these four folds matched o1-labs' own values by **two adjacent `IO.println`s** in
`EmitCommitStages.lean` — a human reading two lines of stdout and agreeing they were the same
digits. A sibling lane deleted exactly that shape after finding all 174 of its constants correctly
copied, and its reason is the reason these exist: *"one wrong digit would have given a
self-consistent tree — Lean proving the program computes ITS constants, the harness pinning ITS
digest, every gate green."*

Each theorem below says the AFFINE fold this file emits a descriptor for lands on the value the
gate cone already carries from Mina devnet block 539508 — and each of those goldens is separately
`by decide`-checked against o1-labs' `PolyComm::multi_scalar_mul`. The `golds` printlns are
deleted; a reader wanting the comparison reads these.

⚠ What these do NOT say is that the SCALING is in-circuit — it is not, in this file. These are
folds of PRE-SCALED points, and `MinaWrapXiAggregateMsm` is where the ξ-aggregate's scalar
multiplication actually happens inside a descriptor. -/

Each stage is a program padded to a power-of-two height with `add R0, #0 → ∅` — a real ALU
operation, because `selSumExpr` is inherited and there is no nop. The ROM manifest has one row per

length: a prover cannot run the program twice, stop early, or pad. -/

`MinaWrapXiScalarWeld` §3 measured the obstruction and the fix in the same breath: the ξ-aggregate
had **no PI slot** for a computed scalar, and the derivation that closes it needs a **six**-element
challenge vector rather than a 47-element one. This is the publishing half. Eight blocks, `8 · 32 =
256` public inputs:

| block | row | register | what it carries |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | first | `TX` | `ξ` — consumed from `MinaWrapXiEndoLift`'s output |
| 1 | last | `TY` | `ξ⁴⁶`, the orbit's endpoint |
| 2–7 | last | `XB32 … XB1` | ⚑ **the squaring basis, high power first** |

⚠ **FLAG DAY.** `piCount` moves `64 → 256` and the descriptor is `::v2`; `mina-commit-xi.json` and
`mina-commit-xi-pis.txt` re-emit, and a `::v1` artifact no longer resolves under this name. Nothing
