# `MinaWrapDeferredWords` — the forty words Pickles hands the wrap circuit, MEASURED

## ⚑ SAY THE SUBSTRATE OUT LOUD

**This is Lean-authored data, not a constraint.** Nothing here emits a gate. It is the VALUE layer
that `KimchiWrapMain`'s W-FTCOMM / W-COMBINE / W-BULLET read where upstream reads the public words,
and House Law #1 is untouched: the AIR stays Lean-authored and Rust only produced the measurement.

## Where these numbers come from

`metatheory/fixtures/pickles-extractors/src/bin/pickles_kimchi_marshal.rs` proves a **step** rung on
Vesta over **Mina's own SRS** (`get_srs::<Fp>()`, 65,536 generators), reads its Fiat-Shamir
transcript, computes the IPA accumulator, and hands the assembled statement to openmina's own
`PreparedStatement::to_public_input(40)`
(`/Users/ember/dev/mina-rust/crates/ledger/src/proofs/public_input/prepared_statement.rs:53-182`).
That is Mina's function, not ours. It writes `wrap-public-input.json`; this list is that file.

⚑ **THE PROVER'S BLINDING RNG IS SEEDED, WHICH IS WHAT MAKES THIS A FIXTURE AND NOT A SNAPSHOT.**
It was `OsRng` until 2026-08-05, so every run produced a different step proof and therefore a
different forty. A constant carrying them would have been stale the moment the binary was re-run,
and the loop (run -> read -> bake -> re-emit) would have had no fixed point at all. Two consecutive
runs are now byte-identical in `wrap-public-input.json`, `marshalled.binprot` and the o1js proof.
Re-derive with:

    cargo run --release --manifest-path metatheory/fixtures/pickles-extractors/Cargo.toml \
      --bin pickles_kimchi_marshal -- <out-dir>

## ⚠ What these are, and what they are NOT

They ARE a real instance of the right object: `expand_deferred`'s recomputation over a real step
proof's transcript, in Mina's own slot order and Mina's own encodings. They are NOT a devnet block's
-- `MinaWrapPublicCommGate.PUBLIC_INPUT` is that, and it is a different proof. And baking them here
does NOT make the wrap assembly a wrap proof OF that step proof: the assembly's own transcript runs
over fixture commitments, so the twenty-four slots this circuit DERIVES are its own transcript's and
do not agree with the ones below. **Only slots 0-4 and 9 -- the six `wrap_main` never derives --
come from here.** The rest of this list is carried so the width signature and the tail can be
checked against the same source.

## ⚑ The object at each slot, which is the thing a slot map gets wrong

Widths are the tell, and they are checked below rather than asserted. `spec.ml:374-392` packs
`Challenge` / `Scalar Challenge` / `Bulletproof_challenge` at `Challenge.length = 128` -- the RAW
prechallenge -- where `Digest` packs at `Field.size_in_bits`. A slot carrying the 255-bit endo lift
where the raw prechallenge belongs is the classic defect: the right name over the wrong object, and
nothing but the width sees it. `the_width_signature_is_minas_own_layout` is that check.

⚑ **And slots 0-4 are each `.shifted`** (`prepared_statement.rs:99-103`), a `Shifted_value.Type1`
and NOT the raw field value. `KimchiWrapMainCore` consumes them in exactly that representation
(`:1973`, `:4145-4147`), so the number below is fed straight in with no un-shift.

Axiom-clean: `by decide` only; no `sorry`, no `native_decide`.

255-bit endo lift where `spec.ml` packs the raw prechallenge moves no index and no count, and this
