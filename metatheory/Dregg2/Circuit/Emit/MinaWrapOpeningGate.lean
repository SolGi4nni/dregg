# Dregg2.Circuit.Emit.MinaWrapOpeningGate — RUNG 5f: **the rung that OPENS a commitment.**

Everything before this in `docs/MINA-REAL-BLOCK-GATE.md` §6.1 checks that our arithmetic agrees
with kimchi's on real objects. 5a-5d assemble commitments; 5e derives one. **None of them says a
commitment is a commitment TO anything.** This file states the equation that does, on Mina devnet
block **539508**.

## The object

`SRS::verify` (`poly-commitment/src/ipa.rs:118-300`) folds TWO independent statements into one
randomised MSM, with independent randomisers `rand_base` and `sg_rand_base`:

```text
(A)  sg == <s, srs.g>                                             -- the sg / accumulator leg
(B)  c·Q + delta − z1·sg − z1·b0·U − z2·H == O                    -- THE OPENING RELATION
     where  Q  = Σ_j (chal_invⱼ·Lⱼ + chalⱼ·Rⱼ) + Σ_i ξⁱ·Cᵢ + cip·U
            U  = groupMap(sponge.challenge_fq())
            b0 = Σ_j evalscaleʲ · b_poly(chal, evaluation_pointⱼ)
```

**(B) is this rung.** With `rand_base = 1` it is exactly `check_bulletproof`'s verifier equation.
The 47-term `Σ ξⁱ·Cᵢ` inside `Q` is 5d's aggregate — which carries the block's `w_comm`, `z_comm`,
`t_comm` (through `ft_comm`), the index's `sigma_comm`/`coefficients_comm`/selector commitments,
and 5e's `public_comm`. `cip` is `combined_inner_product`, which `MinaRealBlockGate`'s C8 already
proved is the `(ξ, r)`-fold of the block's **claimed evaluations**. So (B) holding says: the
polynomials those commitments commit to really do take the claimed values at ζ and ζω.

## What was blocking it, and what unblocked it

Every scalar in (B) that is not in the proof is an **Fq-sponge output**: `u_base` is the group map
applied to `challenge_fq()`, and `c` and the 15 IPA challenges are `opening.challenges::<EFqSponge>`.
Until `MinaRealBlockTranscript` landed there was no sponge on this block to continue. There is now:
§3 below picks the phase-1 sponge up at the state `SRS::verify` receives it in — `o.fq_sponge`,
the state right after ζ′ — and runs it forward through `absorb_fr(shift_scalar(cip))`,
`challenge_fq`, the 15 `absorb_g(L)/absorb_g(R)/squeeze` rounds and `absorb_g(delta)`. **All 16
challenges of the opening argument are derived here, not carried.**

## What this rung establishes, and what it still assumes — say both

**Establishes**, in-kernel, over the real group law mod the real prime, on a real Mina block:
the IPA verifier's opening equation holds for this proof at the challenges its own transcript
samples.

**Assumes, and does not discharge:**

1. **P10, the opening-soundness floor.** (B) is the verifier's *check*; that a prover which
   passes it must KNOW an opening is the IPA/dlog extraction argument, which is undischarged here
   and everywhere in this stack. "We opened a commitment" means "the opening check passes", not
   "the opening is sound".
2. **(A), the `<s, srs.g>` leg — rung 5h, DEFERRED BY MEASUREMENT.** (B) uses `sg` as the IPA's
   final `G`; that `sg` really is `<b_poly_coefficients(chal), srs.g>` is a 2^15-term SRS MSM,
   extrapolated at **~18 hours and ~7 TB** of elaborator memory in-kernel (§6.1). It is measured
   TRUE in Rust by the extractor (`[gt8]`) and discharged out-of-circuit by openmina's own
   `accumulator_check`; it is **not** checked in this kernel. Without (A), (B) is a statement
   about an opening against a `G` the proof supplied.
3. **Poseidon's collision resistance**, as everywhere a transcript is used.
4. **`p` is prime** — §4's non-residue certificates are Euler's criterion.
5. The SRS itself: that `srs.g` and `srs.h` are what they claim is not checked by anything here.

## Cost, measured

34 × 255-bit RCB ladders per instance of the relation (2×15 `lr` + the aggregate + `u_base` + `sg`
+ `h`) ≈ 13 s of kernel at §6.1's 0.19 s/ladder unit; `delta` enters with coefficient 1 and costs
no ladder. The sponge continuation is ~50 Poseidon permutations, evaluated by the COMPILER — as
`MinaRealBlockTranscript`'s are, and as these were when they were `#guard`s. Ten instances of the relation plus the transcript: **153 s /
14.3 GB peak RSS measured on hbox** (`lake build`; 174 s standalone on a loaded box) — the
prediction and the measurement agree, which is what makes the 5h extrapolation in §6.1 worth
anything.

## What pins the gold

The extractor asserts (B) **directly, deterministically, with arkworks group arithmetic**, before
emitting: `[gt6]` is `residual.is_zero()`, and `[gt7]` re-runs it at `z1 + 1` and at
`combined + G` and requires BOTH to be non-zero. `[gt8]` asserts (A). All of it sits behind
`kimchi::verifier::verify = Ok(())` and `SRS::verify = true` on the same object.

## Axiom hygiene — ⚠ CORRECTED 2026-08-05, because the old line was FALSE-BY-OMISSION

`#assert_namespace_axioms` pins **26 theorems kernel-clean**, and **9 are `except`ed** as
`native_decide` + `#assert_compiled`: the IPA-transcript replay and its non-vacuity controls.

⚠ This header used to read *"Axiom-clean: `by decide` and `#guard`; no `sorry`, no `native_decide`"*.
Every clause was literally true and the sentence was misleading, because the nine `#guard`s ran the
**same unsafe compiled evaluator `native_decide` runs on** — the file was already trusting the
compiler for the whole sponge replay, and the phrase "no `native_decide`" read as though it were not.
Converting them changed no trust; it made the trust COUNTABLE, and it is counted in the `except`
clause at the end of the file. No `sorry`. Zero `#guard`s.

`MinaRealBlockTranscript.wrapPhase1` ran the Fq-sponge to ζ′ and stopped. `oracles(...)` takes
its `digest()` on a CLONE (`verifier.rs:283`), so the sponge `SRS::verify` receives is exactly
that state. It is rebuilt here from the transcript module's own tape and pinned by the digest
before a single further absorb. -/

⚠ `native_decide`, and it says so. This was a `#guard` until 2026-08-05, which ran the SAME unsafe
compiled evaluator with the name, the term and the axiom record deleted — so nothing is trusted here
