# Dregg2.Circuit.Emit.MinaWrapVerifierAir — the in-AIR Kimchi/Wrap verifier's ROW, and the stage
census that prices it.

## ⚑ SAY THE SUBSTRATE OUT LOUD

**This is Lean-authored AIR.** The row layout, every gate expression and the emitted descriptor are
authored here and go through the compiler (`EffectLower.lowerAir` of an `EffectAirIR.EffectAir`);
`mainRailOk = true` holds by `rfl`. There is no hand-written `VmConstraint2` anywhere in this file.
Rust PROVES the artifact and authors no constraint. House Law #1.

## WHAT THIS IS

`PastaFieldSound` and `PastaAddSubSound` each emit ONE Pasta operation as a standalone descriptor —
a multiply (253 constraints / 190 columns) and an add/sub (160 / 128). Six such descriptors are
checked in and, until this file, **every one of them was used only by its own soundness test**. A
verifier is not one operation; it is ~1.6 M of them in a fixed order. This file is the unit that
makes that sayable:

  * **§1–§3 the ALU ROW.** One row that can be a multiply OR an add OR a sub, selector-gated, in a
    layout that costs `794` committed columns against the standalone multiply's `694` — **1.14× for
    full operation generality**, because the add/sub operands reuse the multiply's own limb blocks
    and its range lookups. All three polarities reduce to the two existing forcing theorems with no
    re-derived bound: `felt_gates_force_congruence` and `addsub_gates_force_congruence` are both
    parametric in their base columns, which is exactly what makes the reuse legitimate rather than a
    second copy.
  * **§4 the CHAIN, and what it does NOT do.** `nxt.x = loc.z` under a selector — the only
    inter-row wiring `EffectAirIR`'s main rail can express. `chain_forces_limb_congruence` and
    `chain_forces_limb_equality` say what a chained transition buys;
    `unchained_transition_relates_nothing` says, as a theorem and not a caveat, what an unchained
    one does not; and `inter_row_wiring_is_transition_only` exhibits, on the IR's own decidable
    verdict, why there is no third option.
  * **§5 the STAGE CENSUS**, derived from the atom and verified against o1-labs source.
  * **§6 the OPENING'S VACUITY, as a theorem** (`opening_is_vacuous_when_sg_is_free`).

## ⚑ WHAT THIS IS NOT

It is **not** a Wrap verification and it is **not** machine-checked Pickles. What the emitted
descriptor establishes, exactly, is: *every row satisfying the gates performs the Pasta field
operation its selector names, and every CHAINED transition feeds one row's output to the next row's
first operand.* Whether the resulting straight-line program IS Kimchi's `verify` is a statement
about the TRACE GENERATOR, and this file proves nothing about that. §5's census is a PRICE, not a
proof of coverage.

## ⚑ THE THREE COUNTS VERIFIED AT SOURCE (this brief was carrying one that is wrong by 3.65×)

  * **The ξ-aggregate is 47 terms.** `~/dev/proof-systems/kimchi/src/verifier.rs:969-1075`, counted
    for a Wrap VK (no lookup index, no optional gate commitments): `2` recursion (`polys`, at
    `Max_proofs_verified = 2`) `+ 1` `public_comm` `+ 1` `ft_comm` `+ 1` `Column::Z` `+ 6` index
    commitments (Generic · Poseidon · CompleteAdd · VarBaseMul · EndoMul · EndoMulScalar) `+ 15`
    witness (`COLUMNS`) `+ 15` coefficient `+ 6` sigma (`PERMUTS − 1`) = **47**. Confirmed.
  * **The SRS is 2^15 = 32 768 bases and the IPA runs 15 rounds**, while the wrap DOMAIN is
    2^14 = 16 384 — two different powers, and reading either for the other is the error the brief
    warns about. The domain figure is independently pinned by `KimchiWrapMain`'s own measurement
    against the devnet wrap VK.
  * ⚑ **AND THE COLUMN COUNT IN THE PRICE WAS THE DECLARED ONE.** Measured 2026-08-04 on the
    deployed prover: `pasta-fpmul-sound` declares 190 columns and the prover commits to **694** —
    `MainLayout::build` appends a nibble-decomposition aux block per declared range lookup, so the
    committed width is `trace_width + Σ decomp_cols(bits)` and the inflation is **3.65×**. Every
    trace-size and LDE figure denominated in 190 is low by that factor. §5 prices in committed
    columns.

## Axiom hygiene

/-! ## §1 — THE ROW LAYOUT.

⚑ The whole reason the ALU is cheap is that **the add/sub operands ARE the multiply's operands**.
`PastaAddSubSound` lays an add out at `AX_BASE = 0, AY_BASE = 32, AZ_BASE = 64`; `PastaFieldSound`
lays a multiply out at `X_BASE = 0, Y_BASE = 32, Z_BASE = 64`. Those coincide, and both files use
the same `SB = 8` limb encoding — so one set of three 32-column blocks and one set of 96 8-bit range
lookups serves all three operations. Only the reduction witnesses differ, and those get their own
columns. -/

/-- The multiply's quotient block: 32 columns of 8-bit limbs at `96`. Unused on an add/sub row
(the witness fills it with zeros, which its own range lookups accept). -/
def ALU_Q_BASE : Nat := 3 * SK
/-- The multiply's 62 carry columns at `128`, range-checked at `CB = 16`. -/
def ALU_C_BASE : Nat := 4 * SK
/-- ⚑ The add/sub carry BIT, at `190` — its OWN column at width 1, not a cell of the quotient
block. `PastaAddSubSound.adDigit_abs_le` needs `0 ≤ c < 2` to bound the digit by four bytes; an
8-bit column would need that bound re-derived, so this file spends one column and one width-1 table
instead of re-proving a bound that already exists. -/

verbatim, so `fpMulSound_forces` — which is stated at `X_BASE / Y_BASE / Z_BASE / Q_BASE / C_BASE` —
is a statement about THESE columns and needs no re-basing. A future edit that moved either layout
would break this `rfl` rather than silently make §3's reuse a statement about a different row. -/

/-! ## §2 — THE GATES.

Each operation's body is the expression its own sound module already emits, multiplied by that
operation's selector. That multiplication is the ONLY new algebra in this file, and it is what makes
one row able to be three things. -/

/-- The selector-gated multiply gate at index `m`: `sMul · coefExpr m`. ⚑ Degree **3** — the body is
already degree 2 (`x_i · y_j`) and the selector adds one. The deployed main-AIR degree budget is 3
(`descriptor_ir2.rs`'s `ir2_degree_budget`), so this sits exactly at it. -/

legs because they are `.transition` (the ONLY scope in which `nxt` is the successor row and not the
wrap row), and the seven `limbs` legs because every declared width is `0 < bits ≤ 29`. A window leg
re-scoped to `.all`, or a limb width of 30, would emit `refuseConstraints` and make this false. -/

its descriptors carry `piCount = 0` and no `.pin` leg appears in the block — so every leg lands in
the non-`pin` arm of `EffectAir.pinsTied` and the verdict follows from the leg SHAPES, at seven
blocks rather than the 171 legs a `decide` would whnf one at a time.

the `intro m _; rfl` arm with a goal it cannot close, and this would go red. -/

`+ 4` booleanity `+ 1` selector-sum `+ 32` chain windows `+ 222` range lookups
(`4·32` limbs + `62` multiply carries + `1` carry bit + `31` add/sub carries) = **386**
constraints. Against the standalone multiply's `253` that is **1.53× the constraints** — and
against its `694` committed columns the ALU's `794` is **1.14× the WIDTH**, which is the number
that decides the trace size. A row that can be any of three operations costs 14% more memory than a
row that can only multiply.

**THE LEG SHAPE — 171 legs and 222 range lookups**, and the two numbers are separate because
a limb leg is ONE leg and MANY lookups. `63` multiply gates `+ 32` add `+ 32` sub `+ 4` booleanity
`+ 1` selector-sum `+ 32` chain windows `+ 7` limb legs = `171`; the seven limb legs carry

⚠ The emitted CONSTRAINT count is `171 − 7 + 222 = 386` — every non-limb leg lowers to exactly one
constraint (`EffectLower.lowerLeg_ne_nil` is the floor; the gate/window arms are singletons) and a
limb leg lowers to one per limb. That figure is asserted in Rust against the emitted JSON
(`circuit/tests/pasta_alu_verifier_row_proves.rs`) rather than here, because kernel-reducing the
assembled 386-constraint list did not terminate inside `maxHeartbeats 4000000` — which is itself
worth recording: the compiler's output is checkable by the deployed parser far more cheaply than by
the kernel, so the shape pin lives at the SOURCE (here) and the byte pin at the ARTIFACT (Rust). -/

This is the honest boundary of what the emitted AIR establishes. A trace of `N` rows in which every
`sChain` is `0` satisfies the chain legs completely and is `N` UNRELATED Pasta operations. The
number of chained transitions is therefore the measure of how much of a verifier a given trace is,
and it is a property of the TRACE, not of this descriptor. §5's row census prices the operations;
it does not establish that any of them are wired to each other. -/

row. So a straight-line chain `row i → row i+1` is expressible and an arbitrary dataflow
`row i → row j` is not — there is no copy-permutation leg on the main rail, and a memory-bus
alternative would need `mult ≠ 1` (a padded/conditional query), which `LookupLeg.mainRailOk` also

/-! ## §5b — ⚑⚑ THE PRICE RE-DERIVED IN THE GEOMETRY THAT NOW EXISTS (2026-08-06)

§5's census is in ALU ROWS, and it was correct. What it could not say, because the object did not
exist when it was written, is what a row COSTS — and the standing figure the tree carried
(`LightClientMinaAir` §1b: *"≈10³ BabyBear constraints per Pasta multiplication … one Wrap
verification is then ≈10⁹ constraints … at a generous ~100 constraints packed per row that is ~10⁷
rows ≈ 2^23.3"*) answered that with an ESTIMATE. Two SOUND rows have since been emitted and
measured, so the estimate can be replaced by their declared widths.

⚑ **THE STANDING FIGURE GOT THE SHAPE WRONG, NOT ONLY THE SIZE.** It assumed ~100 constraints
packed per row and therefore 10⁷ rows — near a power-of-two ceiling, which is what made the verdict
*"the construction is wrong"*. The deployed sound rows are **3 048** and **226** columns wide, so the
same work is `2^18.09` rows: **35× fewer, and nearly seven powers of two under the measured `lb = 2`
ceiling of `2^25`.** The binding resource was never rows. It is committed CELLS.

⚠ **AND THE ATOM COUNT WAS CONFLATED.** §1b's *"≈1.06 M Pasta-field multiplications"* is neither
this census's multiply count nor its op count: `RCB` is 12 multiplies and 29 add/subs, so 34 816
complete additions are **417 792 multiplies and 1 009 664 add/subs**, and the transcript stage adds
**170 940 multiplies and 73 260 additions** — `588 732` multiplies inside `1 671 656` operations.
Priced against the two emitted descriptors' own declared constraint counts (253 for the multiply,
160 for the add/sub), charging every operation as a MULTIPLY over-charges by ~1.31×, and charging
each at 10³ constraints over-charges by ~5.2×.

⚠ This paragraph read `~1.34×` and `~4.4×` before 2026-08-08. Neither reproduces from the 253/160
descriptor pair at EITHER census, so they were prose rather than derivation; the two above are
computed from the counts named in the same sentence.

⚑ **WHAT MOVED ON 2026-08-08, WHEN §5's ROUND WENT 21 → 30 INSTRUCTIONS**: cells
`144 751 608 → 161 308 368`, rows `205 756 → 279 016`, witness `~579 MB → ~645 MB`, add/subs
`1 009 664 → 1 082 924`. ⚑ **THE MULTIPLY COUNT DID NOT MOVE** — it was `588 732` before and after,
because the census's `21` per round was the multiply count and was RIGHT; the nine additions per
round were the entire error. The CONCLUSION — rows were never the wall, cells are — survives, which
is the only reason a 35.6% error in the headline sat here for a day. It is welded now
(`MinaWrapVerifierSponge` §8), not restated.

⚠ **WHAT THESE THEOREMS ARE.** Prices, exactly as §5's are — `atom cells × operations`, where the
atom is an EMITTED descriptor's declared width. A number moving is a real signal; a number being
right is not evidence that any trace IS the stage it is named for. The SRS-base leg stays excluded

/-! ## §6 — THE OPENING IS VACUOUS UNTIL THE SRS-BASE LEG IS DISCHARGED.

⚑ This is the mandate's item 5, and it is here as a THEOREM because a comment cannot be checked.

The IPA opening relation the verifier ends on is, in the shape this construction can carry:

    lhs  =  Σᵢ (challengeᵢ · Lᵢ  +  challengeᵢ⁻¹ · Rᵢ)  +  C
    rhs  =  z₁ · (G + b·U)  +  z₂ · H          with   G := sg

and `sg` — the "shifted group element", `openings_proof.sg` — is a witness the prover supplies. Its
own defining relation is `sg = ⟨s, srs.g⟩`, an MSM over the 32 768 SRS bases, which is exactly the
leg §5 excludes. With that leg absent, `sg` enters this construction as a FREE point.

`opening_is_vacuous_when_sg_is_free` is that fact stated where it cannot be skipped: modelled as
a relation `R sg` which the verifier checks, if `sg` is existentially chosen by the prover and the
relation is solvable for `sg` at every value of the rest, then the relation refutes nothing. -/

/-- A minimal model of the closing check: the verifier accepts when `lhs` equals a value computed
from the prover-chosen `sg`. `f` is everything the rest of the verifier fixes; `g` is the
`sg`-dependent side. -/
def openingAccepts (f : ℤ) (g : ℤ → ℤ) (sg : ℤ) : Prop := f = g sg

/-- ⚑ **THE VACUITY, AS A THEOREM.** If the `sg`-side map `g` is surjective — which it is here,
because `sg` enters `rhs = z₁·(G + b·U) + z₂·H` linearly through `G := sg` with an invertible
coefficient — then for EVERY `f` a prover can choose an `sg` that makes the check pass. The 0.41 M
rows this stage costs therefore refute nothing at all until the SRS-base leg pins `sg` to
`⟨s, srs.g⟩`.

⚠ Read what this does and does not say. It does NOT say the opening stage is worthless: the stage
is the STRUCTURE the discharge plugs into, and every row of it is a real Pasta operation forced by
§3. It says that the stage's ACCEPTANCE is unconditional on `sg` while `sg` is free, so no
soundness claim may be attached to it, and any bound quoted for the construction must exclude it. -/

  exact ⟨sg, hsg.symm⟩

/-- The concrete instance: `sg` enters linearly with a unit coefficient, so the surjectivity
hypothesis above is discharged rather than assumed. `z₁` is the prover's IPA scalar and the map is
`sg ↦ z₁·sg + rest`; at `z₁ = 1` (and generally at any unit) it is a bijection of ℤ. -/
theorem sg_side_is_surjective (rest : ℤ) : Function.Surjective (fun sg : ℤ => sg + rest) :=

/-- ⚑ **AND THE POLE THAT MAKES IT NOT A TAUTOLOGY.** Once `sg` is PINNED — which is what the
SRS-base leg does — the same relation refutes: at a fixed `sg₀` the check holds for exactly one
`f`. A vacuity theorem whose companion cannot go the other way would be saying nothing about the
discharge it is waiting for. -/

/-! ## §7 — THE HONEST WITNESS ROWS, generated here.

Rust fills cells; it does not author them. Each row is the corresponding sound module's own honest
witness re-based into the ALU layout, plus the selector that names the operation. The heavy
gate-satisfaction facts are NOT re-`decide`d here — they already exist at
`PastaFieldSound.fpHonest_satisfies_gates` and `PastaAddSubSound.fpAdd/fpSubHonest_satisfies_gates`,
and §3's `aluMulExpr_eval` / `aluAddSubExpr_eval` are the bridge from those bodies to these gates.
What IS proved here is the re-basing: that each row agrees with its source witness on the columns
the operation's gates read, and that every emitted cell is a canonical felt. The DEPLOYED polarity
— honest proves, forged refuses — is checked in Rust against `prove_vm_descriptor2`, which is the
only place it can be checked. -/

A falsifier alone proves a gate can refuse; it does not prove the gate is satisfiable. The pair
below is the positive side: row 0 multiplies `X · Y = Z`, sets `SEL_CHAIN = 1`, and row 1 adds
`Z + 0 = Z` — so row 1's `x` block IS row 0's `z` block, limb for limb, and the 32 chain legs hold
with the selector ON rather than vacuously. -/

/-! ## §7 — ⚑⚑ THE CHEAP MULTIPLY, ON THE ROW THAT CARRIES 588 732 OF THEM.

`§5`'s census is why this section exists: `WRAP_MULS = 588 732` is a `decide`d theorem and it does
NOT move — it is `WRAP_ADDSUBS` at `1 082 924` that moved when the Poseidon round was re-counted.
The ALU row spends **63 of its 386 constraints** and **2 269 of its per-row multiplication nodes**
on the multiply polarity, and `PastaSzMul` collapses exactly that block.

⚑ **THE SELECTOR SURVIVES THE SWAP, AND IT IS THE ONLY NEW ALGEBRA.** `aluMulExpr` is
`sMul · coefExpr m`; `aluSzBody` is `sMul · szBodyAt …`, the same multiplication by the same
selector column, over a `ChalExpr` instead of an `Expr`. Trace degree is unchanged at **3** — the
sz body is degree 2 in the trace and a challenge is DEGREE ZERO for quotient sizing
(`p3-air/src/symbolic/variable.rs:67-72`, `ExtEntry::Challenge => 0`), so the 32-deep Horner chains
cost nothing in the quotient and the row still sits exactly at `ir2_degree_budget = 3`.

⚑ **THE LAYOUT DOES NOT MOVE AT ALL.** `szBodyAt` is relocated to `X_BASE / Y_BASE / Z_BASE /
ALU_Q_BASE / ALU_C_BASE` — the SAME columns `alu_reuses_the_multiply_layout` pins — and it reads the
carry block OFFSET-DECODED at `COFF`, which is what `aluMulRow` already writes. So `ALU_WIDTH` is
still 226, the seven `limbs` legs are the same seven, the committed width is still 794, and **the
honest fixture rows of §4b are the honest fixture rows of both AIRs.**

⚠ **AND WHAT DOES NOT IMPROVE.** Columns, range lookups, committed width, trace height, LDE domain:
all identical. The win is the AIR's constraint count (`386 → 325`) and the prover's and verifier's
per-row evaluation arithmetic (`2 269 → 444` multiplication nodes in the multiply block). At the
wrap workload that is `1.04 × 10⁹` multiplication nodes removed
(`the_wrap_multiply_arithmetic_collapse`) and **zero committed cells**. Anyone selling this as a
trace-size fix is quoting the wrong currency.

⚠ **THE LEDGER RIDES ALONG, AND IT IS A HYPOTHESIS.** The sz polarity forces the congruence only at
a NON-EXCEPTIONAL draw, and `PastaSzMul.sz_single_challenge_is_below_the_bar` is a theorem that ONE
draw unions across this very census to `2^−98.5` — below the repo's ~124-bit bar. That is why
`pastaAluSzAir` carries TWO challenge gates and why the single-challenge form is not offered here.
The two-point form is `2^−197.0` (`sz_two_point_clears_the_bar`). That a drawn challenge is
non-exceptional is the one thing Schwartz–Zippel never discharges; the transcript ordering and the
per-context sampling that make the draw post-commitment are READ off pinned Plonky3 `82cfad7` and
cited, not modelled. -/

/-! ### §7a — ⚑ WHAT AN SZ MULTIPLY ROW FORCES.

Same conclusion as `alu_mul_forces`, in the shape `PastaSzMul` proves it in: the hypothesis is
`ChalConstraint.holdsIn` — the `assert_zero_ext` denotation over an arbitrary `CommRing K`, which
the deployed prover instantiates at `BinomialExtensionField<BabyBear,4>` — and not `P ∣ body` over
the `2^31` base lane. Plus the disjunction, which is where the randomness lives. -/

/-- ⚑ **THE SELECTOR COMES OFF, and it is one line.** With `sMul = 1` the gated gate's faithful
denotation IS the ungated body's, so `PastaSzMul`'s theorems apply verbatim at the ALU's bases. -/

legs supply the ranges, BOTH emitted challenge gates hold at the drawn point, and EITHER draw is
non-exceptional. Conclusion: the Pasta congruence at the real Pallas-base prime — the same
conclusion `alu_mul_forces` reaches from 63 gates. -/

gated body is `0` in EVERY carrier at EVERY draw — so an add row's two challenge gates check
nothing, exactly as its 63 coefficient gates checked nothing before. Stated so that "325
