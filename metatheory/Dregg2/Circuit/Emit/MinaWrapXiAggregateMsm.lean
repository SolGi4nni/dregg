# `Dregg2.Circuit.Emit.MinaWrapXiAggregateMsm` — the ξ-AGGREGATE, with the SCALAR MULTIPLICATION
INSIDE THE CIRCUIT.

## ⚑ SAY THE SUBSTRATE OUT LOUD

**This is Lean-authored AIR.** The emitted object is
`PastaMsmBucketed.bucketedRowDescChal NC N_PAD NBITS C GENS SCAL` — an `EffectVmDescriptor2` built
by a Lean `def` out of Lean-authored `VmConstraint2`s, whose first 42 constraints are
`PastaMsmWindowed.rowGates` verbatim (`bucketedRowDesc_extends_rowGates`), i.e. the same
`PastaCurveComplete.pallasCompleteAdd` the whole Pasta cone shares, and whose narrow form is a
PREFIX of it (`bucketedRowDescChalOn_extends_the_narrow_descriptor`). This file authors **no new
gate**: it names a curve, a window, a generator list, a scalar list and a challenge-block WIDTH, and
it proves things about the resulting artifact. Rust parses the descriptor, fills trace CELLS and
runs the deployed prover. House Law #1.

## ⚑ THE DEFECT THIS FILE CLOSES, stated as it was found

`MinaWrapCommitStages.xiAggDesc` folds 47 terms — at full term count, with the real block's
points, against o1-labs' own aggregate. But its ROM immediates are `XI_TERMS`, and

```
def XI_TERMS : List Aff :=
  (List.range 47).map (fun i => toAff (MinaWrapGroupGate.smul (qpow XI i) …))
```

is **PRE-SCALED**: `MinaWrapGroupGate.smul` is a Lean REFERENCE FUNCTION, not a gate. The scalar
multiplication — the entire content of an MSM — happened before the descriptor existed. What that
descriptor forces is *"these 47 hardcoded points, added in this order, give this hardcoded point."*
A prover that wanted a different aggregate would change the ROM, and the ROM is the thing the
verifier reads.

Here the scalars are **not** applied in advance. `SCAL` carries the 47 powers of the block's real
`ξ` as NUMBERS; `GENS` carries the 47 unscaled commitments. The descriptor's `T_COVER` permutation
forces every `(window, generator)` pair to be consumed exactly once at the sweep level equal to its
declared digit, and the fused running sum

  `Σ_i s_i·P_i = Σ_{d=1}^{D} ( Σ_{i : d_i ≥ d} P_i )`

makes the accumulation the trace's own work. **`s_i·P_i` is computed by the AIR, not handed to it.**

## ⚠ THE GAPS THIS INHERITS, and they are inherited KNOWINGLY

Nothing below repairs these; they belong to `PastaMsmBucketed` and they travel with it.

1. **The digits are DECLARED, not DERIVED BY A GATE.** `T_COVER`'s manifest carries `digit_w(s_i)`
   as a descriptor parameter, so the artifact is SCALAR-SPECIALISED: it forces the trace to compute
   `Σ s_i·P_i` for the `s` the descriptor names. ⚑ **What §3b/§2-pre DO close is where that `s`
   comes from:** since 2026-08-05 the six-value squaring basis that GENERATES all 47 scalars is on
   this descriptor's own wire, 192 public-input felts, welded elementwise to
   `dregg-mina-xi-scalar-vector::v2`'s published basis and thence to a `ξ` an emitted AIR lifted out
   of the block's Fq sponge. `MinaWrapXiBasisWeld` is that weld and its §4 is the resolution
   statement. ⚠ An emitted gate chain that re-derives each row's digit FROM the wire block is still
   not built; `PastaMsmBucketed` §7.3 prices it.
2. **The row template is `pallasCompleteAdd`.** Correct for this cone — the ξ-aggregate is a WRAP
   commitment combination over Pallas — but the Vesta swap `bucketedRowDescVesta` offers is not
   exercised here.
3. ⚑ **The rows are denominated in the UNSOUND `fpMulCore`.** `PastaMsmBucketed` §7.2 says so, and
   it must be repeated here rather than absorbed, because the cone this file joins
   (`MinaWrapCommitStages`) is emitted at `PastaFieldSound`. **That is a downgrade, and it is a
   downgrade to be STATED, not absorbed:** the ξ-aggregate now scales in-circuit at the cost of
   moving from the sound multiply to the oversized one. The 495-bit gate coefficients are why the
   Rust side must parse through `parse_vm_descriptor2_unsound_oversized`.

## The parameters, and why each is forced rather than chosen

`c = 2`, `nbits = 255`, `n = 59`. §1 proves the trace height is `8192`, a power of two, which the
deployed prover requires AND which a permutation manifest's length must equal. The 12 padding terms
carry scalar `0`; the fused identity's inner sums range over `d ≥ 1`, so a zero-digit term appears
in none of them and contributes nothing — `the_padding_contributes_nothing`.

/-! ### ⚑⚑ §2-pre — THE SIX-VALUE BASIS ON THE WIRE, and why SIX.

`MinaWrapXiScalarWeld.the_squaring_basis_generates_the_orbit` measured it and did not build it: at
`c⃗ = (ξ³², ξ¹⁶, ξ⁸, ξ⁴, ξ², ξ)` the tensor `∏_j c_j^{bit_j(i)}` **is** `ξ^i` for every `i < 64`, so
the 47 scalars of this aggregate are generated by SIX values and not by forty-seven. Six values at
`SK = 32` eight-bit limbs is `192` public-input felts — a surface this descriptor can carry, where
`47 · 32 = 1 504` was the number that made the whole idea look like a re-architecture.

⚑ **THE ENCODING IS THE COMMIT-MACHINE'S, ON PURPOSE.** 32 limbs of 8 bits is what
`MinaWrapCommitStages.piBlock` writes and what `MinaWrapXiEndoLift` already publishes, so the weld
in `MinaWrapXiBasisWeld` is a **slice comparison and not a re-encoding**: a batch verifier compares
`aggPIs[27 … 218]` against `xiPIs[64 … 255]` felt by felt and does no arithmetic. The alternative —
this cone's own `9 × 30` coordinate limbs — would have made the tie a 255-bit recomposition in the
verifier, which is the cost the whole cone exists to remove.

⚠ **AND IT LEAVES A COST FOR THE RUNG AFTER THIS ONE, stated rather than discovered later.** The
in-circuit tensor chain reduces in `fqMulCore`, which reads `9 × 30`; consuming these felts in-row
will need an `8 → 30` bit regroup with its range certificates. That is a real cost of that rung and
it is the price of making THIS tie free for the verifier. -/

Until this section the four folds of `MinaWrapCommitStages` matched o1-labs by **two adjacent
`IO.println`s** in `EmitCommitStages.lean` — a human reading two lines of stdout and agreeing they
were the same digits. A sibling lane's verdict on exactly that shape, and the reason it fixed a
transcription it had already checked by hand: *"one wrong digit would have given a self-consistent
tree — Lean proving the program computes ITS constants, the harness pinning ITS digest, every gate
green."* The printlns are deleted; these are what replaced them. -/

/-- ⚑ **THE MSM THIS DESCRIPTOR NAMES IS o1-LABS' OWN AGGREGATE.**

`COMBINED_GOLD` is `Σᵢ ξⁱ·Cᵢ` as o1-labs' `PolyComm::multi_scalar_mul` computed it on Mina devnet
block 539508. This is 47 full 255-bit RCB ladders and 59 complete adds in the Lean kernel, over the
padded lists the DESCRIPTOR carries — not over a tidied copy of them.

⚑ It is also an INDEPENDENT route to that point. `MinaWrapAggregationGate.combinedComm_reproduces_
kimchi` reaches `COMBINED_GOLD` by `chunkedComm`, a HORNER fold (`res := res·ξ + c`) that never
forms a power of ξ at all. This one forms all 47 powers explicitly and multiplies each into its own
generator. Two different computations, one point: that is a gate, where a constant checked against
its own definition would have been decoration. -/

/-! ## §4 — WHAT STILL HOLDS A VALUE NOTHING COMPUTES, at CURRENT resolution.

Read this before citing anything above.

⚑ **`ξ` AND ITS BASIS — ON THE WIRE SINCE 2026-08-05. Read exactly which half moved.**

  * `MinaWrapXiEndoLift` emits `ScalarChallenge(v′).to_field(endo_r)` AS AN AIR and proves its
    output is o1-labs' own `ξ` on the block's own `v′` — which `MinaBlockFqTranscript`'s emitted
    2 048-row Fq sponge squeezes from Mina devnet block 539508's 91-element phase-2 tape. **`ξ` is
    computed, from the transcript, not typed.**
  * `MinaWrapCommitStages.xiChainProg` taps `ξ, ξ², ξ⁴, ξ⁸, ξ¹⁶, ξ³²` out of its own 46-multiply
    walk and its `::v2` descriptor publishes them as **192 public-input felts**.
  * ⚑ **THIS descriptor now has 192 slots to equal them in**, pinned on the first row and threaded
    down the trace, and `MinaWrapXiBasisWeld` proves the two 192-felt blocks are equal
    **elementwise, no digest, no re-encoding** — the same standard `the_endo_output_block_is_the_
    chain_input_block` met at 32.
  * And `MinaWrapXiBasisWeld` §3 proves `T_COVER`'s 7 552 declared digits are `digit_w` of the
    TENSOR IMAGE of exactly those 192 felts, over all 59 terms and all 128 windows.

⚑⚑ **AND THE CENSUS SCORES THE 192 AS DECORATIVE — 192 OF 219 PUBLIC INPUTS, 87.7%, THE LARGEST
ROW IN `scripts/descriptor-anchor-inertness-baseline.txt`.** Measured 2026-08-05 at source, not
inferred: columns `612 … 803` are each touched by EXACTLY TWO constraints — `chalPinGates`'
first-row `piBinding` and `chalThreadGates`' `nxt CH_m − CH_m` — and by nothing that relates them
to another column. `nxt c` and `loc c` are the same column, so a thread is a UNARY window gate and
the census reads it as joining nothing, **which is right**. The thread does real work (the block is
one trace-global vector, not 8 192 free ones, and `a_basis_that_varies_by_row_is_refused` measures
it firing as p3 constraint `#311` on row 4095); what it does not do is relate the basis to the MSM.

The row is minted rather than argued away, with its reason in that file, and it carries a RUNNING
TEST — `circuit/tests/pasta_msm_bucketed_prove.rs::the_published_basis_is_not_yet_bound_to_the_
declared_digits` proves and verifies this aggregate against a basis that is NOT the block's own,
reaching the same `COMBINED_GOLD` over an identical row template. ⚠ **The row goes to zero when
`T_COVER`'s digits become these felts' in-circuit image, and not before.** Recomposing the 32 limbs
of each value into a value column, or hashing the block into an anchor, would join all 192 columns
to each other and zero the census while leaving 192 free witnesses — the "absorbing them as chip
INPUTS" laundering that census file refuses by name.

⚠ **WHAT THIS IS NOT, and it must not be read as more.** The digits are still DESCRIPTOR data.
`T_COVER` is `exactPublicRows` and `PublicLookupBalanced` demands a PERMUTATION, so the deployed
prover already refuses a moved `DGT` — the digits were never forgeable and this is therefore **not a
soundness repair**. What changed is the QUANTIFIER on the challenge: it was *a constant the verifier
is told*, and it is now *a value the verifier already holds from another proof of this block's own
transcript*. The remaining half — an emitted gate chain that RE-DERIVES each row's digit from the
wire block, `PastaMsmScalarDerive`'s `PRc`/`MUc`/`QUc` in this layout — is **not built**;
`PastaMsmBucketed` §7.3 prices it at ~1 400 constraints and ~2 700 columns, plus the `8 → 30` limb
regroup §2-pre names.

⚑ **THE UNSOUND MULTIPLY.** Stated in the header and repeated because it is the kind of thing that
gets absorbed: these rows are `fpMulCore`, not `PastaFieldSound`. `PastaMsmBucketed` §6d prices the
sound row at over a hundredfold the gate count. ⚑ **And the widening does not touch it** — neither
`chalPinGates` nor `chalThreadGates` multiplies anything, so when the `EffectAir`↔gadget bridge
lands and the rows become sound, this whole wire block carries over unchanged. -/

area. That is what a verifier-free basis tie costs here, and it is a number rather than an
adjective. -/
theorem the_wire_block_costs_thirty_one_percent_more_area :
    bucketedRows N_PAD NBITS C * NC = 1572864
      ∧ bucketedRows N_PAD NBITS C * WK = 5013504
      ∧ 100 * (bucketedRows N_PAD NBITS C * NC) < 32 * (bucketedRows N_PAD NBITS C * WK) := by
  refine ⟨by decide, by decide, by decide⟩

/-- ⚑ **THE TERM ROWS ARE 92% OF THE TRACE**, and the rest is the fused collapse — the census that
says the padding is a rounding error and the object is really doing 7 552 conditional adds. -/
theorem the_term_rows_dominate :
    termRows N_PAD NBITS C = 7552 ∧ 100 * termRows N_PAD NBITS C > 92 * bucketedRows N_PAD NBITS C

/-- ⚑ **AND THE REAL WORK IS 47/59 OF THAT.** The 12 padding terms occupy 1 536 of the 7 552 term
rows; a reader pricing this object should price the real content. -/
