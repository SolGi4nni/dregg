# `Dregg2.Circuit.Emit.MinaWrapXiBasisWeld` — THE AGGREGATE'S SCALARS ARE COMPUTED, AND THE
GENERATOR IS ON THE WIRE.

## ⚑ SAY THE SUBSTRATE OUT LOUD

**This file emits nothing and authors no gate.** Every object it names is emitted somewhere else —
`MinaWrapCommitStages.xiDesc` (the machine), `MinaWrapXiAggregateMsm.xiAggMsmDesc` (the bucketed
MSM), `MinaWrapXiEndoLift.endoDesc` (the lift) — and every theorem here reads one of those artifacts
as DATA and compares it with another. House Law #1 is not at risk in this file. What IS at risk is
the honesty of the comparison, and §4 is where that is priced.

## THE SENTENCE THIS RETIRES

`MinaWrapXiScalarWeld` §3, its own author, measuring the obstruction and the fix in one breath:

> ⚑ **So there is no PI slot on the aggregate for a published scalar to equal.** […] ⚑ **And for
> THIS aggregate the derivation is already the right shape**: `PastaMsmScalarDerive.sAt` computes
> `s_i = ∏_j c_j^{bit_j(i)}`, and at `c⃗ = (ξ³², ξ¹⁶, ξ⁸, ξ⁴, ξ², ξ)` that IS `ξ^i` — so the
> ξ-aggregate needs a SIX-element challenge vector on the wire, not a 47-element one.
> `the_squaring_basis_generates_the_orbit` is that fact, stated here so the next lane builds the
> weld instead of rediscovering that it fits.

The obstruction was a **missing surface**, not a property of the layout, and both halves of it are
now built:

  * `MinaWrapCommitStages.xiChainProg` taps `ξ, ξ², ξ⁴, ξ⁸, ξ¹⁶, ξ³²` out of the 46-multiply walk it
    was already doing and publishes them — `dregg-mina-xi-scalar-vector::v2`, `piCount = 256`.
  * `PastaMsmBucketed.chalPinGates`/`chalThreadGates` widen the aggregate to `27 + 192` public
    inputs over 192 fresh columns — `…-c2-w192::v1`, `piCount = 219`, `traceWidth = 804`.

## ⚑⚑ THE TWO TIES, AND WHAT EACH IS WORTH

  1. **§2 — THE WIRE TIE.** The aggregate's 192 published felts and the chain's 192 published felts
     are the SAME LIST, elementwise. `47 · 32 = 1 504` was the number that made this look like a
     re-architecture; `6 · 32 = 192` is the number that fits. **No digest, no representative, no
     re-encoding** — both sides publish at `SK = 32` eight-bit limbs, so a batch verifier compares
     two slices and does no arithmetic. There is nothing to collide, hence no birthday bound:
     `a_perturbed_wire_felt_breaks_the_weld` moves ONE felt and it fails.

  2. **§3 — THE DIGIT WELD.** `T_COVER`'s 8 192 emitted rows are the base-`2^c` digits of the
     TENSOR IMAGE of exactly those 192 felts, under `PastaMsmScalarDerive`'s own `sAt` — over all 59
     terms and all 128 windows. `tensorQ_is_sNat` is the general bridge that makes "the tensor" that
     file's function and not one this file invented.

## ⚠ WHAT THIS IS NOT — read before citing any of it

**This is not a soundness repair, and it must not be described as one.** `T_COVER` is
`TableSem.exactPublicRows`, `DescriptorIR2.PublicLookupBalanced` demands a PERMUTATION of the
declared list, and the deployed prover refuses a moved `DGT` (`a_generator_folded_at_the_wrong_
level_is_refused`). The digits were never forgeable.

What moved is the QUANTIFIER on the challenge. Before: *`ξ` is a constant the descriptor names, and
the verifier is told it.* After: *`ξ`'s squaring basis is 192 felts on this proof's wire, equal to
192 felts on the wire of a proof whose AIR derived `ξ` from Mina devnet block 539508's own Fq sponge
squeeze.* That is a real change and it is a bounded one.

⚠ **AND THE REMAINING HALF IS NOT BUILT.** An emitted gate chain that RE-DERIVES each row's digit
from the wire block — `PastaMsmScalarDerive`'s `PRc`/`MUc`/`QUc` ported into this layout — is what
would make the digits an in-circuit image rather than a checked-once-per-(block, VK) one.
`PastaMsmBucketed` §7.3 prices it at ~1 400 constraints and ~2 700 columns, and
`MinaWrapXiAggregateMsm` §2-pre adds the `8 → 30` limb regroup this encoding choice hands it.

/-! ## §1 — THE TENSOR, AS `PastaMsmScalarDerive`'s OWN FUNCTION.

`PastaMsmScalarBound.sAt` is stated over an arbitrary `CommRing`, and the deployed instance is
`Fq = ZMod qN`. Nothing in this tree evaluates a `ZMod qN` product in the KERNEL — the two places
that touch `sScalars` at a concrete challenge list do it through `#guard`, i.e. the compiled
evaluator. So the tensor is spelled here in `Nat` at `q`, and the two are joined by a GENERAL
theorem rather than by a convention this file asserts.

⚑ **`tensorQ` is `sAt`'s recursion verbatim**: the head challenge pairs with the HIGH bit, one
factor per challenge, `1` where the bit is clear. Getting that backwards gives `ξ^(bit-reversed i)`,
which agrees with `ξ^i` at `i ∈ {0, 63}` and nowhere else — `a_transposed_basis_leaves_the_digits`
is the refutation. -/

/-- ⚑⚑ **AND IT IS `PastaMsmScalarDerive`'s TENSOR, NOT A MIRROR OF IT.**

A general theorem over every challenge list whose entries are canonical, for every index — so the
digit weld below is a statement about the function that file emits gates for, and a later rung that
builds those gates is welding to the same object. Without this, §3 would be green about a product
this file defined and named after one it never touched. -/

/-! ## §2 — ⚑⚑ THE WIRE TIE: 192 FELTS, ELEMENTWISE.

`MinaWrapXiEndoLift.the_endo_output_block_is_the_chain_input_block` met this standard at 32 felts
and said why it matters at exactly that width. This is the same standard at 192. -/

def chainBasisBlock : List ℤ :=
  Dregg2.Circuit.Emit.MinaWrapCommitStages.xiPIs.drop (2 * SK)

/-- ⚑⚑ **THE WELD.** The aggregate's wire block IS the chain's wire block — elementwise, all 192
felts.

Two separately emitted descriptors, two separately generated traces, one shared 192-felt boundary.
A batch that verifies both proofs and compares these two slices learns that the six values
generating the aggregate's 47 scalars are the six the machine derived, by five squarings, from a `ξ`
`MinaWrapXiEndoLift` lifted out of Mina devnet block 539508's own Fq sponge squeeze.

⚠ And the two lists are built by DIFFERENT routes: `basisPIs` from `MinaWrapXiAggregateMsm`'s own
`qpow` over `MinaWrapAggregationGate.XI`, `chainBasisBlock` off the machine's published register
file. A file that built one from the other would be checking a constant against its own
definition. -/
theorem the_aggregate_wire_block_is_the_chain_wire_block :
    aggBasisBlock = chainBasisBlock := by decide

/-- ⚑ **AND IT IS 192 FELTS OF SIX DISTINCT FULL-WIDTH VALUES.** Stated because
`the_aggregate_wire_block_is_the_chain_wire_block` would be equally green over a ONE-felt block, and
a one-felt tie between two descriptors is `2^31` — below this repo's bar and exactly the shape the
`proof_bind` seam already has. It would also be equally green over six copies of one value, which is
what a tap that aliased its register would publish. -/

/-- ⚑ The felt the refutation below moves, READ rather than assumed: the most significant limb of
the head basis value `ξ³²`. It is a NON-ZERO byte, and raising it by one changes the value that
block decodes to — so the tamper moves a number and not merely a list entry.

⚑ This exists because a sibling in this cone drafted a refutation that moved a row whose digit was
ZERO into an accumulator that was also zero, and `decide` REFUTED the refutation — *a tamper that
changes nothing is not a tamper*, and nothing but reading the value would have said so. The first
draft of THIS theorem guessed the felt was `27`; `decide` refuted that too. -/

/-- ⚑ **AND THE WELD IS REFUTABLE, ONE FELT AT A TIME.** The felt above raised by one — the smallest
change a forger could make to the shared boundary — and the equality is false. This is what makes
the weld a gate rather than a restatement of how both sides were built. -/

proves is `ScalarChallenge(v′).to_field(endo_r)` at Mina devnet block 539508's own `v′`.

So the six numbers the aggregate's wire carries are `ξ³², ξ¹⁶, ξ⁸, ξ⁴, ξ², ξ` **of a `ξ` that came
out of a sponge**, and not six numbers a descriptor named. -/

⚠ The `if` is not a convenience. `tensorQ wireBasis i` is `ξ^i` for every `i < 64`, so it is NOT
zero at `i ∈ [47, 59)`: the padding is a property of THIS descriptor's term count, not of the

This is the digit weld. The table is resolved by NAME out of the emitted artifact's own table list —
the singleton on the right is what refuses a second table under the same name — and its
`exactPublicRows` manifest is `coverManifest` of the scalars the wire block GENERATES, over the
window count the descriptor actually has.

⚠ Read §4 before citing it: the digits are still descriptor data, and `T_COVER`'s permutation is
still what forces them. What this says is where they COME FROM. -/

carrying `digit_w` of the tensor image at the generator index the row itself names.

⚠ Stated as the manifest's SHAPE rather than re-derived cell by cell. A per-cell `decide` over
7 552 rows re-evaluates `derivedScalars` — 47 six-factor tensors — once per cell, and it blew a

inheriting another's claim.

| `ξ` crosses to the machine | **WIRE** — 32 felts, elementwise |
| `ξ` → `ξ², ξ⁴, ξ⁸, ξ¹⁶, ξ³²` | **COMPUTED** — five multiplies of `xiChainProg`, published at `::v2` |

| `T_COVER` → `Σ sᵢ·Pᵢ` | **COMPUTED IN-CIRCUIT** — the fused running sum, 8 192 rows |

⚠ **THE ONE ROW THAT IS STILL A READER'S JOB** is `the basis → the 59 scalars`. It is a Lean theorem
over two emitted artifacts, not an emitted gate, so it is checked once per (block, VK) by whoever
reads them — and it costs that reader the 282 modular multiplications a batch verifier does not do.
`PastaMsmBucketed` §7.3's derivation is what turns that row into an in-circuit one; it is not built,
it is priced, and it is the next rung.

⚑ **AND THE `fpMulCore` DOWNGRADE IS NOT LIFTED, NOT SPREAD AND NOT REPAIRED.** The aggregate's rows
are the unsound multiply; `MinaWrapCommitStages` and `MinaWrapXiEndoLift` are `PastaFieldSound`. The
blocker is a TYPE obstruction and not a cost (`swCompleteAddGadget` takes gate CONSTRUCTORS while
`PastaFieldSound`/`PastaAddSubSound` are `EffectAir`s lowered through `EffectLower.lowerAir`, so no
sound complete-add and no sound `smul` core exist in this tree at all). ⚑ **When that bridge lands,
everything in this file carries over unchanged** — §2 compares two PI vectors and §3 reads a
manifest, and **neither half mentions the row template's multiply.** `chalPinGates` and
