# `Dregg2.Circuit.Emit.MinaWrapXiEndoLift` — ξ STOPS BEING TOLD.

## ⚑ SAY THE SUBSTRATE OUT LOUD

**This is Lean-authored AIR.** The emitted object is `MinaWrapCommitMachine.commitAir` — the SAME
machine, the SAME three opcodes, the SAME instruction ROM and register window `MinaWrapCommitStages`
emits its four stages on — carrying a different program and a different pair of boundary pins. This
file authors **no new gate**. Rust parses the descriptor, fills cells and runs the deployed prover.
House Law #1.

## ⚑ THE DEFECT THIS FILE CLOSES, stated as its author left it

`MinaWrapXiAggregateMsm` §4:

> **`ξ` ITSELF.** `SCAL` is the 47 powers as descriptor constants. […] **AND `ξ` IS ITSELF A
> TRANSCRIPT OUTPUT.** Even welded to the chain, `ξ` enters as a public input; binding it to the
> Fq sponge's squeeze is `MinaWrapVerifierSponge`'s cone, not this one.

That cone landed. `MinaBlockFqTranscript.the_machine_squeezes_the_real_blocks_v_and_u` proves the
in-AIR Fq sponge — 2 048 emitted rows, the real `fq_kimchi` constants, a 45-permutation-deep state
derived from Mina devnet block **539508**'s own 91-element phase-2 tape — ends with
`LINK_V_RAW % 2^128 = WRAP_V_CHAL`. And `WRAP_V_CHAL` is `v′`, the **polyscale prechallenge**.

**The step between `v′` and `ξ` is `ScalarChallenge::to_field(endo_r)`** (`sponge.rs:190-226`), and
`MinaWrapChallenges` §2's own note says where it lives and that it is deliberately not there:

> `Circuit.Emit.KimchiVerify.endoMap`, there is exactly one of it in this tree, and it belongs with
> the CONSUMER.

This file is that consumer. It emits the endomorphism lift **as an AIR** — 64 rounds of
double-and-conditional-±1 over `ZMod qN` with a 128-bit in-circuit decomposition whose closing
assertion pins the bits to the challenge — and it proves the emitted program's output is o1-labs'
own `ξ` on the block's own `v′`.

## ⚑ THE WELD, AND ITS WIDTH — read this before citing anything below

Two emitted objects are tied here by a **public-input equality**, and the tie is stated at the width
it actually has rather than at the width a digest would suggest:

  * `dregg-mina-xi-endo-lift::v1`'s LAST-row pin publishes `ξ` as **`SK = 32` eight-bit limbs**;
  * `dregg-mina-xi-scalar-vector::v1`'s FIRST-row pin consumes `ξ` as the same 32 limbs.

`the_endo_output_block_is_the_chain_input_block` is that equality, and it is **32 felts / 255 bits
of agreement, elementwise** — not a one-felt commitment. That distinction is the whole reason this
theorem is stated on the limb LISTS: the `proof_bind` seam's `commit`/`vk`/`bound` are one felt each
against an eight-lane object, which is `2^31` and below this repo's bar. A PI equality between two
descriptors is exactly where that mistake would be free to make, and it is not made here.

⚠ **And the tie is elementwise, so it has no birthday bound at all.** There is no digest to collide;
`a_perturbed_output_limb_breaks_the_weld` moves ONE of the 32 felts and the equality is refuted.

## ⚑ WHAT IS COMPUTED NOW, AND WHAT IS STILL TOLD

  1. `v′` — **COMPUTED**, by `MinaBlockFqTranscript`'s emitted sponge, from the block's tape.
  2. `ξ` — **COMPUTED**, here, from `v′`. `the_machine_computes_the_endo_lift`.
  3. `ξ⁰ … ξ⁴⁶` — **COMPUTED**, by `MinaWrapCommitStages.xiChainProg`'s 46 multiplies, from the ξ
     this file publishes; the two are joined by the PI equality above.
  4. the ξ-AGGREGATE's 47 SCALARS — ⚠ **STILL DECLARED.** `MinaWrapXiAggregateMsm`'s digits live in
     `T_COVER`'s `exactPublicRows` manifest, and `PastaMsmBucketed` §7.4 names the obstruction
     exactly: *"This descriptor's `piCount = 27` publishes only the output `C`; `u⃗` enters through
     `T_COVER`'s declared digits and is therefore a DESCRIPTOR PARAMETER, not a wire value."* There
     is no PI slot on the aggregate for this file's output to equal. `MinaWrapXiScalarWeld` states
     what CAN be tied — the manifest's 47 recomposed scalars against the orbit of this ξ, at full
     width — and says plainly that it is a descriptor-to-descriptor equality and not a wire one.

⚑ **THE UNSOUND MULTIPLY IS NOT INHERITED HERE, AND THAT IS WORTH SAYING PLAINLY.** This descriptor
is `PastaFieldSound.qLimb`, like every descriptor in `MinaWrapCommitStages`. The `fpMulCore`
downgrade belongs to `PastaMsmBucketed`'s rows and travels only with the aggregate; it is not
lifted, not repaired and not spread. `MinaWrapXiAggregateMsm` §4's third bullet stands unchanged.

⚑ There is no second implementation of the endomorphism lift here. `endoLiftQ` is
`KimchiVerify.endoMap` — the transcription of `sponge.rs:190-226` this tree already had — read at
`ZMod qN` and projected back to a `Nat` by `ZMod.val`. A file that re-authored the fold would be
free to re-author it WRONG, and every theorem below would still be green about its own function. -/

the polyscale `MinaWrapAggregationGate` uses to build `COMBINED_GOLD`, dumped from `oracles.v`.

Eleven of the machine's twelve registers, and the allocation is the lift's own state:

  * `OUT` — the lifted scalar, PINNED on the last row.
  * `A`, `B` — `to_field`'s two accumulators, both starting at the field `2`.
  * `B0`, `B1` — the round's two bits, each pinned boolean by a multiply and an assert.
  * `S` — `±1`, computed as `2·b₀ − 1` rather than branched on.
  * `SC` — the scalar accumulator that makes the bits the bits OF something. -/

clear, to `a` when it is set. Written branch-free, because the machine has no branch:

  `s := 2·b₀ − 1` · `a := a + b₁·s` · `b := b + (1 − b₁)·s`

and `(1 − b₁)·s` is `s − b₁·s`, which the round already has in `T0`.

⚑ The last four instructions are the SCALAR FOLD, `sc := 4·sc + 2·b₁ + b₀`, and they are the reason
the bits are not 128 free choices: `emitBit`'s note one file over says it, and the closing
`eqR SC VP` is where it binds. -/

The machine's own strict interpreter, from the pinned input, on the emitted instruction list — not

  * **Elementwise, 32 felts, 255 bits.** There is no digest in it, hence no birthday bound and no
    `2^{n/2}`: a forger must produce a limb list that agrees in all 32 places, which is agreement on
    the value. `a_perturbed_output_limb_breaks_the_weld` moves one felt and it fails.
  * **It is checked where the public inputs are.** A batch verifier compares two slices of two PI
    vectors. It does not recompute the lift and it does not recompute the powers.
  * ⚠ **It ties ξ, and it does not tie the aggregate's digits.** The aggregate has no PI slot for
    them (`PastaMsmBucketed` §7.4). `MinaWrapXiScalarWeld` states the tie that IS available on that
    side and prices it honestly.
  * ⚠ **And a PI equality is not a proof of anything on its own.** It is worth exactly what the two
    proofs it joins are worth, and both of those stand on the undischarged FRI/STARK floor this
    repo has not closed. -/
