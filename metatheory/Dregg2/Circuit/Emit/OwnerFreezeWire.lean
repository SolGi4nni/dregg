# Dregg2.Circuit.Emit.OwnerFreezeWire — the OWNER FREEZE, on the wire.

## THE WOUND (E10), measured, not inferred

`circuit/tests/zzz_e10_freeze_owner_falsifier.rs` PASSES today, and its assertion is
`assert!(owner_forge_accepted)` — **1 passed means the hole is open.** Over the LIVE
`cellSealVmDescriptor2R24` parsed from the committed staged registry, it builds an honest seal,
proves and verifies it, then builds a SECOND self-consistent seal differing only in the AFTER owner
octet, and the deployed `verify_vm_descriptor2` ACCEPTS it. Its control (freezing the AFTER
lifecycle limb against `PI[46]`) is REJECTED, so the harness is live.

Root cause, and it is a MISSING CONSTRAINT, not an encoding weakness:

  * the committed owner-key octet `B_PUBKEY_OCTET = 105 .. 112` (the operated cell's
    `public_key`, `rotation_witness.rs::produce` → `canonical_32_to_felts_8(cell.public_key())`) is
    absorbed UNCONDITIONALLY into `state_commit`/NEW_COMMIT via the `wireCommitR` chain,
  * and is welded by NO `colEq` — `frozenAuthorityColEqs` freezes `B_RECORD_DIGEST · B_LIFECYCLE ·
    B_PERMS · B_VK · B_MODE · B_FIELDS_ROOT` plus the 7 headroom and 14 perms/vk completion limbs;
    the pubkey octet is in NONE of them — and pinned to NO PI on the plain path,
  * and `PI[43]` (rotated NEW commit) is the prover's CLAIMED post-state, tied by `pi_binding` to
    the trace's AFTER `B_STATE_COMMIT` and NOT independently recomputed (`proof_verify.rs`). So a
    self-consistent AFTER block with a forged owner mints a NEW_COMMIT the verifier adopts as the
    new ledger root. **No collision is required. The lock is irrelevant while this door stands.**

## ⚑ THE SCOPE IS THE WHOLE COHORT, AND THE MEASUREMENT SAYS SO

The scout expected a carve-out for the cell-CREATING members (`createCell`,
`createCellFromFactory`, `spawn`) and for `makeSovereign`. **Measured at HEAD, there is none, and
the reason is structural rather than a case analysis:**

  * every rotated member's AFTER cell is derived by ONE function — `cipherclerk.rs:5612`
    `let mut after_cell = before_cell.clone();` then `rw::apply_effect_to_cell(&mut after_cell, …)`
    per effect (and `:6345` for the multi-cohort producer, the same shape),
  * `apply_effect_to_cell` (`turn/src/rotation_witness.rs:764`) writes `state.balance`,
    `state.fields`, `state.nonce`, `permissions`, `verification_key`, `lifecycle` and `mode` — and
    **cannot write `public_key` at all**: `Cell::public_key` is `pub(crate)` in `dregg_cell`
    (`cell/src/cell.rs:345`) and `dregg_turn` is a different crate. `MakeSovereign`'s arm is
    `cell.mode = Sovereign` and nothing else. The creating verbs have no arm; they fall to `_ => {}`.
  * `createCell` / `spawn` do not exempt themselves either: the rotated BEFORE/AFTER pair is the
    OPERATED (parent) cell, and the child is a separate object outside this witness.

So on EVERY rotated cohort member, an honest AFTER owner octet EQUALS its BEFORE octet, by crate
privacy. The freeze rejects no honest witness anywhere in the cohort — it is not a cellSeal patch,
and confining it to cellSeal would leave the identical hole in the other 40 no-freeze members.

## THE FIX — welded on the WIRE, one transform, every member

`ownerFreezeWire` is the `fieldsCanonical9Wire` pattern: a `traceWidth`- / `piCount`- / table- /
site- / range-INVARIANT wrap that the emit driver (`metatheory/EmitRotationV3.lean`) applies to
EVERY rotated member at the v1-face width the member's own NAME declares, so the hardened
`…-v1-avail` members get it at their shifted base for free.

It appends `colEq (w + off) (w + AFTER_BLOCK_OFF + off)` for each owner-lane in-block offset `off`
— the SAME gate shape `frozenAuthorityColEqs` uses. **NOT a PI pin:** a pin binds the AFTER octet
to a prover-supplied PI, which the forger simply publishes at the forged value, and it is exactly
the prover-chooses-both-sides shape `dropUnforcedPins` deleted 157 of. The weld is a `colEq`.

⚑ **AND IT RIDES THE WHOLE DOMAIN.** Applied INNERMOST in the emit pipeline (before
`hardenLastRow`), each `.base (.gate …)` weld is re-lowered to a whole-domain `windowGate`
(`onTransition := false`), so the freeze binds on the LAST row too. That closes by construction the
"vacuous on the wrap row" residual `EffectVmEmitCellSealFrozenPubkey` had to carry, and it is
`ownerFreeze_hardened_freezes_every_row` below, not a hope about row-constancy.

## THE NINTH LANE, HANDLED WITHOUT GUESSING

`KeyLanes9`/`KeyCanonicity9Emit` prove the owner nonet injective, and `lane8_is_absorbed_iff` says
the ninth lane is a real column exactly when `lane8Off < rotatedNumPreLimbs`. This module welds a
lane exactly when that predicate holds (`ownerFreezeColPairs`), and `OWNER_LANE8_OFF` reads the
layout's own allocation (`B_PUBKEY_NINTH_LANE = 186`), so at today's 187-limb geometry the predicate
HOLDS and **nine** lanes are welded — `ownerFreeze_welds_the_ninth_lane`.
`ownerFreeze_welds_lane8_iff_absorbed` is the `iff` that ties the ninth weld to absorption.

⚑ **CORRECTED 2026-08-03.** Two sentences here were stale and one was false, and converting the
`#guard`s is what surfaced both.

  * The paragraph used to say the deployed instance passes `OWNER_LANE8_OFF := rotatedNumPreLimbs`,
    "hence 8 welds". That stopped being true when the knob was repointed at the layout; it is 9.
  * It also said the `#guard` below "cross-checks the emitted pair count against the absorption
    predicate so the two cannot drift". **It cannot.** `ownerFreezeColPairs_length` proves that
    equality for EVERY face width and EVERY offset — both sides read `laneIsColumn`, i.e. the same
    predicate — so the pin is a tautology and no layout move can make it red. The check with teeth
    is `ownerFreeze_welds_the_ninth_lane` (`= 9`), which reads the layout against the pre-limb
    extent. See §1.1.

## WHAT THIS BREAKS

Every member the rotation emit drivers render gains NINE whole-domain gates — the eight octet lanes
plus the ninth lane (`cellSealOwnerFrozen_constraints_length`: `+9`; the header's earlier "8 gates,
211 → 219 constraints" was measured before the ninth lane existed). **That is a descriptor re-emit
and a VK rotation** — both halves of
`dregg-epoch`'s `registry_fp` move, so a pre-flip binary is refused by `epoch::compare`, which is
the correct behaviour and the reason both the narrow and the wide drivers carry the wrap.
Geometry does NOT move: no column, no PI, no hash site, no range, no
table, no `traceWidth` (`ownerFreezeAt_*` below, all `rfl`). `CANONICAL_STATE_SCHEMA_EPOCH` does
not move either — no committed limb changes meaning. What REFUSES to load after the regen: any
proof minted against the pre-weld VK (`epoch::compare` returns a `registry_fp` mismatch), and any
witness whose AFTER owner octet differs from its BEFORE — which, per the measurement above, no
honest producer can construct.

RUNG, stated plainly. AUTHORED + PROVED (`lake build` of this module completes, 3148 jobs, zero
`sorry`, every `#assert_axioms` below green) and WIRED INTO THE EMIT DRIVERS. The wire RENDERING was
measured directly: `emitVmJson2 (hardenLastRow (fieldsCanonical9Wire (ownerFreezeWire cellSealV3)))`
carries `{"t":"window_gate","on_transition":false,…"loc":293…"loc":544}` — the BEFORE↔AFTER owner
limb-0 weld at the live 187 geometry — where the same pipeline WITHOUT this wrap carries zero
occurrences, and the member grows 132087 → 133287 bytes.

NOT reached: the committed descriptor bytes are NOT regenerated, and no verifier consumes the weld
yet. Two blockers, both named and neither a cost estimate. (1) `scripts/emit_descriptors.py` refuses
(`dregg2_source_dirty`, EXIT_REFUSED) while the sibling campaign's Lean is uncommitted, and
`DREGG_VK_REGEN_ALLOW_DIRTY=1` stamps `source_dirty=true`, which `--verify-provenance --strict` then
fails. (2) `EmitRotationV3.lean` cannot even be ELABORATED right now: its pre-existing imports
`UnforcedPiPins` and `CapOpenEmit` both reach `EffectVmEmitRotationWide`, which is RED mid-187
(`wideAppend_pins` / `wideAppend_binds_published` / `v3RegistryWide_binds` axiom-hygiene FAIL). That
blocker predates this wrap — importing `OwnerFreezeWire` alone is green.

WHEN THE REGEN RUNS, `circuit/tests/zzz_e10_freeze_owner_falsifier.rs` MUST FLIP. It asserts
`owner_forge_accepted` today — 1 passed means the hole is open — and its own closing comment says
"if this ever flips to REJECTED, an owner-binding gate landed." Inverting that assertion is the
acceptance test for this weld, and it is the one Rust change this lane deliberately did not make.

/-! ## §1 — the welded columns.

`deployedKeyCols w lane8Off blk l` is `KeyCanonicity9Emit`'s SINGLE SOURCE for "where lane `l` of
the owner nonet lives in block `blk`". Lanes 0..7 are the deployed octet at `B_PUBKEY_OCTET + l`;
lane 8 is at `lane8Off`, which is a column only when the pre-limb region has room for it. The weld
is BEFORE-block lane ↔ AFTER-block lane, at the same lane index. -/

/-- ⚑ **THE ONE KNOB.** The in-block offset of the owner nonet's ninth lane.
⚑ THIS READ `rotatedNumPreLimbs` FOR ONE COMMIT, AND THAT WAS ALREADY WRONG WHEN IT LANDED.
The prose said "the moment the layout allocates the ninth owner lane, set this to that offset".
The layout allocated it SIX MINUTES EARLIER, in the sibling commit of the same wave: limb 186,
absorbed by `wireCommitR` in both blocks. So the weld emitted EIGHT pairs and left the ninth lane
— the one carrying the owner key's source bits 232..255, INCLUDING THE Ed25519 SIGN BIT, the one
bit this entire flag day exists to bind — a free felt on the AFTER side. Composed and emitted,
that is the E10 forgery restored on precisely the lane the nonet was built for: flip the sign
bit in the AFTER block, mint a self-consistent NEW_COMMIT, and `-A` seals as `A`.

Read the LAYOUT's own allocation instead. `B_PUBKEY_NINTH_LANE` is
`(rotated187.octetLaneCol 2 8).getD 0`, i.e. where the octet table actually puts lane 8 — a
different source from the pre-limb COUNT.

⚠ That difference is what gives `ownerFreeze_welds_the_ninth_lane` (`= 9`) its teeth. It does NOT
rescue the pair-count pin this comment used to point at: that one compares the emitted list against
the same predicate the list is filtered by, and §1.1 proves it holds at every offset. -/

/-! ### §1.1 — the pair census. ⚑ AND THE PIN THAT COULD NOT GO RED.

The first assertion here was a `#guard` reading

```text
  (ownerFreezeColPairs EFFECT_VM_WIDTH OWNER_LANE8_OFF).length
    == (if OWNER_LANE8_OFF < rotatedNumPreLimbs then 9 else 8)
```

and its comment said it was a gate "because the two sides come from genuinely different places:
the left from the EMITTED pair list, the right from the layout's octet table compared against the
pre-limb COUNT". **That is false, and writing it as a theorem is what makes it readable.**
`ownerFreezeColPairs_length` below proves the equality for EVERY `w` and EVERY `lane8Off` — it is a
tautology of the definition, because the left side filters by `laneIsColumn`, which IS
`lane8Off < rotatedNumPreLimbs`. Both sides read the same predicate. No layout move can make it
disagree, so the pin could never go red, before or after the repair its own comment describes.

That comment records a real defect and the real repair: the earlier `OWNER_LANE8_OFF :=
rotatedNumPreLimbs` made the condition `n < n`, the weld emitted eight pairs, and the ninth lane —
the one carrying the Ed25519 sign bit — was left free on the AFTER side, six minutes after the
layout allocated it. What is wrong is only the claim that the guard is what would catch a
recurrence. **The tooth is `ownerFreeze_welds_the_ninth_lane`: nine welds, `= 9`, against the
layout's own `B_PUBKEY_NINTH_LANE` — that one is red the moment the ninth lane leaves the absorbed
region.** The tautology is kept, since it was asserted and is true; it is just not a gate. -/

/-- ⚑ **THE GENERAL FACT — AND THE DEMONSTRATION THAT THE PIN IS A TAUTOLOGY.** The emitted pair
count agrees with the absorption predicate at every face width and every ninth-lane offset, because
it is computed FROM that predicate. -/

A CONCRETE witness with a forged AFTER owner, and its refutation with no hypotheses attached: not
"any trace satisfying `hforge` is rejected", but *this* trace, unconditionally, for every `hash`,
every memory boundary, every address list.

The exhibit is the falsifier's forge in miniature: BEFORE owner limb 0 reads `0`, AFTER owner limb 0
reads `1` — one limb, moved by one, everything else zero. The Rust falsifier's forge moves the same
limb over the real curve points and the real deployed packer. -/

/-- The two welded columns are distinct — the AFTER block is a whole `B_SPAN` past the BEFORE one,
and `B_SPAN > 0` at any pre-limb count. Stated off `B_SPAN`, not off a numeral, so the 184 → 187

it on row 0, a transition row; nothing about `d` is used, so this holds of `cellSeal` and of all 56

/-! ### ⚑ THE CENSUS, over the RENDERED WIRE.

The DEPLOYED member carries no owner weld (the hole the Rust falsifier measured); the frozen member
carries all eight. Compared as emitted JSON, so this is a statement about the bytes a verifier
parses — and the pair flips the moment the weld reaches the wire.

Both halves were `#guard`s. The ABSENCE half stays an evaluation — it is a claim about 219 specific
committed constraints and there is nothing general to say about it — but `by decide` puts it in the
KERNEL, which the guard's `unsafe evalExpr` was not. The PRESENCE half became a `∀ k < 8` proved
from the wrap (`ownerWeld_is_on_the_wire`), so it does not depend on re-rendering the member. -/
