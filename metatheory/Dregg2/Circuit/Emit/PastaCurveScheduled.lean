# `Dregg2.Circuit.Emit.PastaCurveScheduled` — the sound RCB complete addition ON THE ALLOCATED
LAYOUT: one op per row, 11 value slots, **481 declared columns instead of 3 048 — and
1 499 COMMITTED instead of 10 756, which is the width the cost law is linear in.**

## ⚑ SAY THE SUBSTRATE OUT LOUD

**This is Lean-authored AIR.** Every column index in this file is COMPUTED BY THE ALLOCATOR
(`AirColumnAlloc.allocate`), not written by hand and not written in Rust. The layout is
`slotOf`/`valueCol`, both derived from `allocate rcbScheduledRanges`; there is no hand-written
`VmConstraint2` anywhere here. House Law #1.

## ⚑ WHAT MOVED, AND IT IS NOT THE ARITHMETIC

`PastaCurveSound.swCompleteAddSoundLegs` asserts all 33 op blocks **on one row**, so
`AirColumnAlloc.rcb_single_row_interference_is_complete` says every live range is the whole row and
`all_interfering_forces_distinct_slots` says the allocation must therefore be injective: **3 048
columns is OPTIMAL for that schedule.** The reuse is created by the SCHEDULE, and this file is the
schedule.

* The 33 ops move to 33 rows (`rcbOpsScheduled`, a proved permutation of the gadget's order that
  respects the DAG — `rcbOpsScheduled_is_a_permutation`, `rcbOpsScheduled_topological`).
* Which op fires on which row is pinned by a **one-hot phase shift register**: 33 phase columns
  plus an idle state, `s₀ = 1` on the first row, `nxt(sᵢ₊₁) = loc(sᵢ)` on the transition. A witness
  selector with booleanity and a sum-to-one is not something the prover can turn off.
* Every op's gates are multiplied by their phase selector. Degree goes 2 → 3, which is FREE here:
  `circuit/src/descriptor_ir2.rs:8244` freezes the main-rail budget at 3 and `IR2_FRI_LOG_BLOWUP`
  (`:6939`) is the constant 6 — the blowup is not a function of degree, and
  `log2_ceil(3−1) = 1` leaves the quotient at 2 chunks exactly as before.
* The 39 value blocks land in **11** column-slots (`rcb_scheduled_alloc_width_is_eleven`), which is
  the peak-live floor, so no allocator can do better on this schedule.

## ⚑ THE RANGE POOLS ARE A SOUNDNESS CONSTRAINT, NOT TIDINESS

`Ir2Air::Main` hardcodes lookup multiplicity to `AB::Expr::ONE`
(`circuit/src/descriptor_ir2.rs:3738`, and `LookupSpec` at `:636` has no multiplicity field at
all), so **a declared range lookup fires on every row**. A physical column shared between an 8-bit
limb and a 16-bit carry would be queried against both tables at every row and would refuse the
honest witness. So the witness columns are pooled by range class — `w1`, `w8`, `w16` — and the
per-op `limbs` legs are replaced by **one pool leg per class, asserted on every row**.

⚑ That is STRICTLY STRONGER than what the one-row block asserted, not weaker: the one-row block
range-checked each op's witness once; this range-checks the whole pool on all 64 rows. The
hypotheses `felt_gates_force_congruence` / `addsub_gates_force_congruence` /
`smul_gates_force_congruence` take (`hx hy hz hq hc`, the byte-ranges that make `|body| < P`) are
therefore available at every op's own row. **No soundness is relaxed to reach the width.**

## ⚑ WHAT IS PROVED HERE, AND WHAT IS NOT — read this before quoting a number

* `pallasScheduledAir_mainRailOk` — the compiler accepts the block. Not a formality: a `limbs` leg
  at width ≥ 30 or an `.all` window reading `nxt` would emit `refuseConstraints` instead.
* `pallasScheduledDesc_certified` — `CertifiedRefines`, produced by `lowerTiedAir`. **Every leg of
  this source is forced by the emitted descriptor**, per-leg, in the source's own `AirLeg.forces`
  vocabulary. This is `EffectLowerCertified`'s existing machinery and it applies unchanged, which
  is the point of §1b of `AirColumnAlloc` (`renameAir_mainRailOk`).
* `pallasScheduledDesc_width` — the width, on the emitted object, and
  `scheduled_columns_fit` — every column the constraints address is inside it.
* `rcbSchedule_is_the_scheduled_dag` — the row order IS `rcbOpsScheduled`, which is itself a
  proved permutation of the gadget's order. A transcription slip here would be a different circuit
  that still emitted and still proved.

⚑⚑ **THE CROSS-ROW ASSIGNMENT RECONSTRUCTION IS PROVED — in `Emit.AirCrossRow`, not here.**
`PastaCurveSound.RcbSat.apply` chains the 33 op blocks over ONE assignment `a`, and on this layout
they live on 33 different rows. `AirCrossRow.rcbSat_of_rows` is the missing theorem: the carried
trace induces a single assignment (`gather`) on which the unscheduled block is satisfied, built
from the carry legs of §3d exactly as this paragraph predicted.
`AirCrossRow.scheduledRows_force_the_rcb_formula` composes it with
`PastaCurveSound.pallasCompleteAddSound_forces`, so **this layout forces the RCB formula at the
real Pallas-base prime**, and `vestaScheduledRows_force_the_rcb_formula` does the Vesta half.

⚠ **Two premises remain, and both are selector plumbing rather than row-crossing.**
`AirCrossRow.PhaseIndicator` (the phase register reads as the one-hot row indicator — §3c's legs
are what force it, and the step that needs an argument is booleanity + sum-to-one over a PRIME
field) and `AirCrossRow.RowsSat` (each row satisfies its own op's core gates — §3a's `gateBy`
legs, needing the `filter isGate` bookkeeping per kind). So this descriptor's status is: **shape,
per-leg refinement, AND end-to-end forcing, the last conditional on the selector reading
honestly.** It is still not emitted by name and no VK is rotated for it.

/-! ### §3d — ⚑ THE CARRY LEGS: what makes a live range mean anything.

A value allocated to slot `k` must survive from its definition row to its last-use row, so the
column carries whenever some value in that slot spans the transition. The mask is the SUM of the
phase selectors of the spanning rows — degree 1, so the carry gate is degree 2.

⚑ **This is where the disjointness invariant is cashed.** Because `alloc_disjoint` guarantees two
values in one slot never overlap, the phase sets of the values sharing slot `k` are disjoint, and
the mask is a sum of distinct one-hot columns — it is never `2`. A mask that could reach `2` would
be a slot carrying two different values across the same transition, which is exactly the bug the
invariant rules out. -/

allocator put there. -/

The column factor is stated as `× 6` because that is the largest integer it clears; the constraint
factor is stated as a bare `<` because `× 2` is FALSE (`2 297 · 2 = 4 594 > 4 476`) and rounding it
up to the flattering figure is how a 1.95 becomes a "2×". -/

/-! ### §5b — ⚑⚑ THE WIDTH THE PROVER COMMITS, WHICH IS THE ONE THE COST LAW IS LINEAR IN.

`traceWidth` is not what `Ir2Air::Main` is `width()`d at: `MainLayout::build`
(`circuit/src/descriptor_ir2.rs:1919`) adds a nibble aux block per declared range lookup. Measured
by `circuit-prove/tests/mina_accumulator_leaf_anatomy.rs::the_wrap_cost_tracks_committed_width_not_declared_width`,
`ops/committed` spreads 1.12× across two shapes where `ops/declared` spreads 1.78× — **so the cost
is linear in committed width and a declared-width ratio over-promises.** -/

/-- ⚑⚑ **THE DEPLOYED ROW COMMITS 10 756 COLUMNS, NOT 3 048** — and this is the cross-check that
makes the model a pin rather than a restatement: `AirColumnAlloc.decompCols` is transcribed from
`descriptor_ir2.rs:1876-1883` and applied to the LEAN source, while the sibling's
`committed_width` reads the EMITTED descriptor's tables in Rust. **Two independent routes, same
number.** (The naive `⌈bits/4⌉` model gives 10 737: the 19-column gap is the partial-top term
making each one-bit add/sub carry cost 2 aux columns, not 1.) -/

    committedWidth Dregg2.Circuit.Emit.PastaCurveSound.RCB_WIDTH
      Dregg2.Circuit.Emit.PastaCurveSound.pallasCompleteAddSoundAir = 10756 := by decide

/-- ⚑⚑ **AND THE SCHEDULED ROW COMMITS 1 499.** -/
theorem the_scheduled_row_commits_1499 :
    committedWidth SCHED_W pallasScheduledAir = 1499 := by decide

/-- ⚑ **7.17× IN THE WIDTH THAT COSTS** — better than the declared-width ratio of 6.34×, because
one op per row is what lets the 3 048 per-op range lookups become 447 per-pool ones, and the aux
block scales with lookups. **The range-decomposition block, not the SSA scratch, is the bigger
half of this win**: 7 708 → 1 018 aux columns, against 2 567 declared columns recovered. -/
theorem the_committed_width_ratio_clears_seven :
    committedWidth SCHED_W pallasScheduledAir * 7
      < committedWidth Dregg2.Circuit.Emit.PastaCurveSound.RCB_WIDTH

  refine ⟨?_, ?_⟩ <;> decide

/-- ⚠ **AND THE RANGE BLOCK IS STILL THE MAJORITY OF WHAT IS COMMITTED** — 67.9% here against
71.7% there. Register allocation does not touch it; `LIMB_BITS` does. Recorded so this cone's win
is not credited for a radix change it did not make. -/
