# `Dregg2.Circuit.Emit.Poseidon2RoundGates` — the deployed Poseidon2-w16 permutation's
ROUND-BY-ROUND ARITHMETIZATION, authored in Lean.

## What this is

`circuit/src/plonky3_prover.rs::poseidon2_permute_expr_lanes` is the hand-written Rust gadget every
in-circuit hash in IR-v2 rides through: it emits `(1 + TOTAL_ROUNDS) · 16 = 352` `assert_eq`
constraints binding each round's output to a witness column, and returns the first 8 lanes of the
final state. It is called from `Ir2Air::Chip | Ir2Air::ChipState16`, and — being Rust-authored AIR —
it is exactly what architectural law #1 forbids.

This file is the Lean author of that algebra. `permEmission aux0 base seed` IS the 352 gate bodies
plus the SHARED DEFINITIONS they read, in the Rust emission order; `ChipTableEmit` splices them into
the chip's `TableAir` and the Rust side only INTERPRETS.

## ⚑ TWO EMISSIONS LIVE HERE. `permEmission` (§5b) IS THE DEPLOYED ONE.

`permEmissionNarrow` (§8) is the same permutation committing **141 lanes instead of 352**: an
internal round's fifteen affine lanes and the initial linear layer's sixteen are carried as
EXPRESSIONS rather than columns. Same round algebra, same KATs, same
`max_constraint_degree = 7` (§8c pins the degree on both emitted objects); measured 2.11× prover,
1.28× verifier, 2.34× committed cells at 2^16 permutations. **§8e is the safety argument as
theorems** — each of the 195 dropped internal lanes is a UNIT MULTIPLE of the gate that survives,
the 16 dropped initial lanes are a definition rather than a constraint, and the two equation
systems have the same solutions under the projection. The chip cutover is a flag day; §8g is the
list, and the Rust witness generator is the item that blocks it.

⚠ `permGateBodies` — the TREE spelling of the same 352 polynomials — is kept, and it is NOT emitted.
It is §7's measurement baseline and §6b's agreement oracle: the shared emission is checked against
it gate by gate, so "the DAG denotes the tree" is a computation on both objects rather than a claim
about the emitter.

## ⚑ SAY THE SUBSTRATE OUT LOUD: this is Lean-authored AIR.

Every constraint below is a Lean `TExpr`. Nothing here hand-writes a Rust constraint.

## Where the constants come from — and why they are not re-transcribed

`Dregg2.Circuit.Poseidon2BabyBearW16` already holds the round constants
(`rcExtInitial`/`rcInternal`/`rcExtFinal`), the linear layers (`mdsLight`/`internalRound`) and the
S-box, KAT-pinned bit-exact against the deployed Rust permutation
(`default_babybear_poseidon2_16().permute(·)`, three `#guard`s at that file's §6). §2 and §3 below
build the emitter's constant tables FROM THOSE, so there is one transcription of the hex in the
tree, not two.

⚠ The one table that is NOT already in Lean in usable form is the internal diagonal: the Lean
`internalRound` carries its coefficients as SHIFTS (`fhalve`, `fdiv2exp _ 27`), while the emitted
expression needs canonical RESIDUES (`state[i] · V[i]`, the Rust `internal_linear_layer_expr`
shape). §3 therefore transcribes `INTERNAL_DIAG` (`circuit/src/poseidon2.rs:92`) and pins it against
the shift form — two INDEPENDENT sources, not a constant checked against its own definition.

## ⚑ THE COST OF A TREE IR, MEASURED — AND CLOSED. §5b, §6b, §7

The Rust gadget gets its size from EXPRESSION SHARING: within a round the 16 S-boxed values are
`AB::Expr` VALUES referenced 35× each by the linear layer (7 from the `MDSMat4` block plus 28 from
the four column sums), and only the round OUTPUT is rebound to a column. A TREE IR pays that as
literal duplication, and the first pass of this file measured it: **140,850 nodes against a
hash-consed DAG of 3,194 — 44.1×**, 70,249 of them arithmetic, evaluated once per row of the
quotient domain at blow-up 64.

**`TableAirIR.TExpr` now has a `shr` leaf and `TableAir` a `defs` list**, so §5b emits the SAME
polynomials with the SAME sharing the Rust gadget has — value for value, not by a hash-consing pass
over the tree. Each `exp_const_u64::<7>` is four definitions because that is its four
multiplications; each `external_linear_layer_expr` is forty because that is what it holds in
`state` and `sums`. §7 measures both spellings side by side.

## Axiom hygiene
No `sorry`, no new axiom. `#eval` appears only in §7, as MEASUREMENT — never as evidence for a
claim.

⚠ **§8 DOES use `native_decide`, and says so with `#assert_compiled` on every one.** §1–§7 are
kernel-clean; §8's counts, layout tiling, degree, KAT agreement, teeth and model differential are
compiled evaluation — the same engine the `#guard`s above run on, named rather than silent. §8's
RELATING theorems (`wide_internal_lane_is_a_unit_multiple`, `narrowSat_iff`,
`narrow_accepts_exactly_the_wide_witnesses`, …) are kernel-clean and pinned with `#assert_axioms`.

/-! ## §1 — The permutation geometry.

Every number is DERIVED from the two the deployed permutation actually fixes (`WIDTH = 16`,
`EXTERNAL_ROUNDS = 8`, `INTERNAL_ROUNDS = 13`) and `#guard`ed, so a drift moves an arithmetic pin
rather than a comment. Source: `circuit/src/poseidon2.rs:21-30`,
`circuit/src/plonky3_prover.rs:{POSEIDON2_PERM_AUX_COLS, POSEIDON2_WIDTH}`. -/

/-- `WIDTH` — the permutation state width. -/
def WIDTH : Nat := 16
/-- `EXTERNAL_ROUNDS` — full rounds, split half before / half after the internal block. -/

/-! ## §2 — The round constants, from the KAT-pinned Lean tables.

`compute_round_constants` (`circuit/src/poseidon2.rs:117`) concatenates: the four
`RC_EXT_INIT` rows, then thirteen rows whose ONLY nonzero lane is `rc[0] = RC_INTERNAL[round]`,
then the four `RC_EXT_FINAL` rows. The hex is `Poseidon2BabyBearW16`'s already — that module's
`perm` is `#guard`ed bit-exact against the deployed Rust permutation, so reusing its tables makes
the KAT the source of these constants rather than a second transcription of the same hex. -/

/-- The 21 round-constant rows, in the deployed order. Internal rounds carry a constant on lane 0
and zero elsewhere — the shape `compute_round_constants` builds. -/
def roundConstants : List (List ℤ) :=

/-- `rc[r][j]`. -/
def rcAt (r j : Nat) : ℤ := (roundConstants.getD r []).getD j 0

/-! ## §3 — The internal diagonal, from TWO independent sources.

`internal_linear_layer_expr` (`circuit/src/plonky3_prover.rs:337`) is
`state[i] ← sum + state[i] · (INTERNAL_DIAG[i] − 1)`, i.e. it needs the canonical RESIDUE of each
`V[i] = d[i] − 1`. `Poseidon2BabyBearW16.internalRound` carries the SAME coefficients in shift form
(`fhalve`, `fdiv2exp _ 8`, …) because that is how p3's specialized BabyBear layer computes them.

So: `internalDiag` transcribes `circuit/src/poseidon2.rs:92`, `Vshift` re-derives the same vector
from the KAT-pinned Lean field arithmetic, and the `#guard` is the AGREEMENT of two independent
sources. A pin of a constant against its own definition would be decoration. -/

/-- `INTERNAL_DIAG` (`circuit/src/poseidon2.rs:92`), canonical residues. -/
def internalDiag : List Nat :=

    2013265918, 2005401602, 1509949442, 1761607682, 2013265907, 7864321, 125829121, 16 ]

/-- `V[i] = INTERNAL_DIAG[i] − 1` — the coefficient the emitted internal layer multiplies by. -/
def V : List ℤ := internalDiag.map (fun d => (d : ℤ) - 1)

/-- `V[i]`. -/
def vCoef (i : Nat) : ℤ := V.getD i 0

/-- The SAME vector `V`, re-derived from `Poseidon2BabyBearW16`'s shift arithmetic — the form the
KAT'd `internalRound` actually applies: `[−2, 1, 2, ½, 3, 4, −½, −3, −4, 2⁻⁸, ¼, ⅛, 2⁻²⁷, −2⁻⁸,
−1/16, −2⁻²⁷]`, canonicalized. -/

    P2.P - P2.fdiv2exp 1 8, P2.P - P2.fdiv2exp 1 4, P2.P - P2.fdiv2exp 1 27 ]

-- ⚑ THE TWO-SOURCE PIN: the Rust residue table and the Lean shift arithmetic agree, lane for lane.
#guard Vshift == internalDiag.map (fun d => d - 1)
#guard V.length == WIDTH

/-! ## §4 — The expression emitters.

Each mirrors its Rust function OPERATION FOR OPERATION, so the emitted polynomial is the deployed
one and the association order is the deployed one too. (Addition is associative in the polynomial
ring, so a re-association would be sound; matching Rust's is what makes a future byte-identity
claim cheap rather than a re-derivation.) -/

/-- `x ↦ x⁷`, exactly as p3's `exp_const_u64::<7>` builds it (`p3-field/src/field.rs:249`):
`x2 = x·x`, `x3 = x2·x`, `x4 = x2·x2`, result `x3·x4`. Seven leaf copies of `x`, six `mul` nodes —
the duplication §7 measures. -/
def eSbox (x : TExpr) : TExpr :=

  let x4 : TExpr := .mul x2 x2

/-- Read state lane `i`, `0` past the end (the Lean `g`, so an under-length state is a ZERO lane
rather than a panic — and `#guard`s below fix the lengths so it never fires). -/
def gx (s : List TExpr) (i : Nat) : TExpr := s.getD i (k 0)

/-- `external_linear_layer_expr` (`circuit/src/plonky3_prover.rs:296`): the `MDSMat4` circulant on
each block of four, then the outer column sums. Left-associated exactly as the Rust `s += …` loop
accumulates `sums[k]`. -/

/-! ## §5 — The 352 gates.

`poseidon2_permute_expr_lanes` walks the aux block in `ROUND_COLS`-sized steps: block 0 is the
POST-INITIAL-LINEAR-LAYER state, block `r+1` the output of round `r`. Each step emits
`assert_eq(state[j], aux[off+j])` — body `state[j] − aux[off+j]` — and then REBINDS
`state[j] := aux[off+j]`, which is why every round's input is a bare column read and the emitted
degree stays at the S-box budget of 7. -/

/-- Aux column of block `b`, lane `j`, for an aux block based at `aux0`. -/
def auxLane (aux0 b j : Nat) : TExpr := v (aux0 + ROUND_COLS * b + j)

/-- The block-`b` state, as the 16 columns the rebinding leaves it at. -/
def auxState (aux0 b : Nat) : List TExpr := (List.range WIDTH).map (auxLane aux0 b)

/-- **THE 352 PERMUTATION GATE BODIES**, in the Rust emission order: the initial linear layer's 16,
then 16 per round for 21 rounds. `seed` is the input state (whatever the calling table seeds its
lanes from); `aux0` is the first aux column. -/
def permGateBodies (aux0 : Nat) (seed : List TExpr) : List TExpr :=
  let init := extLayer seed

/-! ## §5b — ⚑ **THE SAME 352 GATES, SHARED.** This is what gets emitted.

The emitters below are §4's, re-cut so that every value the Rust gadget holds in a variable is a
`TableAir` DEFINITION rather than a duplicated subtree. The correspondence is deliberate and exact,
because the fidelity claim is that the emitted DAG is the deployed gadget's own sharing:

| Rust (`plonky3_prover.rs`)                      | definitions                       |
|-------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| `state[j] + rc_f`                                | 16 per external round             |
| `exp_const_u64::<7>` (`x2`,`x3`,`x4`,`x3·x4`)    | 4 per S-boxed lane                |
| `external_linear_layer_expr` (`t*`, `state`, `sums`) | 20 + 16 + 4 = 40 per layer    |
| `internal_linear_layer_expr` (`sum`)             | 1 per internal round              |

⚠ **The S-box is FOUR definitions, not one.** A single definition holding the whole `x³·x⁴` tree is
the same polynomial and the same node count, but it is SIX multiplications instead of four —
`x2` occurs in both `x3` and `x4` and a tree recomputes it. The prover's cost metric is
`opCount`, not `nodeCount`, and this is where the difference between them bites.

⚠ **Every definition list here is in TOPOLOGICAL ORDER by construction** (`TableAir.defsAcyclic`):
each block's definitions reference only strictly earlier indices, which is what makes the
interpreter's single left-to-right pass a resolution rather than a guess. `#guard`s in §5c pin it.

`base` is the index the FIRST definition of an emission receives; a caller that prepends its own
definitions passes its own count. -/

/-- ⚑ The x⁷ S-box as p3's own FOUR multiplications, each a definition:
`x2 = x·x` (`base`), `x3 = x2·x` (`base+1`), `x4 = x2·x2` (`base+2`), `sb = x3·x4` (`base+3`).

/-! ## §6 — AGREEMENT WITH THE KAT-PINNED PERMUTATION.

The emitted algebra is worthless if it is not the deployed permutation's. `Poseidon2BabyBearW16` is
bit-exact against the deployed Rust hash by three KATs; this section evaluates the EMITTED
EXPRESSIONS on the witness that module's own functions produce, so the emission is checked against
the KAT rather than against a re-reading of the Rust.

⚠ These are `#guard`s, i.e. they are checked by evaluation at elaboration time and fail the build
when they diverge — the same instrument `Poseidon2BabyBearW16`'s KATs use. The FORCING claims (what
an accepting witness implies) are theorems, in `ChipTableEmit`. -/

/-- The 22 intermediate states the deployed permutation passes through: block 0 is the
post-initial-linear-layer state, block `r+1` is round `r`'s output. This is the Lean twin of

`Poseidon2BabyBearW16`'s own round functions so it inherits their KAT. -/

/-! ## §7 — ⚑ THE TREE BLOW-UP, MEASURED — AND WHAT THE SHARING NODE BOUGHT.

The tree spelling (`permGateBodies`, §5) duplicates: within one round the 16 S-boxed lanes are each
referenced 35 times by the external linear layer (7 from the `MDSMat4` block plus 28 from the four
column sums), and each S-box is itself seven copies of its argument. The shared spelling
(`permEmission`, §5b) holds exactly what the Rust gadget holds. Both are measured here, on the
emitted objects, and every number is a `#guard`.

|                       | TREE (§5) | SHARED (§5b) | ratio |
|-----------------------|-----------|--------------|-------|
| expression nodes      | 140,850   | **6,766**    | 20.8× |
| **arithmetic ops**    | **70,249**| **2,668**    | **26.3×** |
| definitions           | —         | 1,078        |       |
| gate bodies           | 352       | 352          |       |

⚑ **`opCount` is the number that matters, not `nodeCount`.** The prover evaluates this per row of
the quotient domain at blow-up 64, and what it pays there is field multiplications and additions —
which is why the S-box is FOUR definitions (p3's own `x2,x3,x4,x3·x4`) and not one definition
holding the 13-node tree: same nodes, six multiplications instead of four.

⚑ **AND THE SHARED EMISSION LANDS ON THE DEPLOYED GADGET'S OWN OP COUNT, exactly.** Counted from
`poseidon2_permute_expr_lanes` itself — 8 external rounds at (16 constant adds + 64 S-box
multiplications + 72 linear-layer adds + 16 `assert_eq` subtractions) = 1,344, 13 internal rounds at
(1 + 4 + 15 + 32 + 16) = 884, plus the initial layer's 88 — the Rust arm performs **2,316** field
operations per row. The emission performs **2,668**, and the difference is **exactly 352**: one
multiplication per gate, because `TExpr` encodes `a − b` as `a + (−1)·b` and has no `sub` node.
`352 = POSEIDON2_AUX_COLS`, and that is the whole residual.

⚠ **THE FORK INSIDE THE FORK, ALSO MEASURED.** A sharing node scoped to ONE EXPRESSION (a `let`
inside `TExpr`, sharing within a gate body but not across gates) is the obvious cheaper design and
it does not work: each of a round's 16 gates reads all 16 S-box values, so a per-gate `let` hoists
the same 16 sixteen times. Measured as the sum of the per-gate hash-consed DAGs — which is exactly
what a per-expression `let` can reach — it is **28,064 nodes, 5.0×**, against the table-level
definition list's 20.8×. That is why `defs` sits on `TableAir` and not inside `TExpr`.

⚑ **THIS PARAGRAPH USED TO DECLINE THE CHEAPER ARITHMETIZATION, AND THAT WAS THE MISTAKE.** It read:
*"none of this is a licence to re-arithmetize … a cheaper circuit would be a DIFFERENT circuit."*
True, and not an objection: **§8 lands the different circuit.** `permEmissionNarrow` commits 141
lanes where this one commits 352, at the SAME `max_constraint_degree = 7` (§8c pins both), for a
measured 2.11× prover / 1.28× verifier / 2.34× committed cells. Everything the old paragraph was
protecting is still protected — the round ALGEBRA does not move, §6's KATs carry over unchanged
(§8d replays them on the narrow arm), and §8e proves the 211 dropped lanes carry no constraint the
141 survivors do not.

**Both emissions live here on purpose, and `permEmission` is the DEPLOYED one** — `ChipTableEmit`
splices it, `CHIP_WIDTH` is 386, `CHIP_TABLE_AIR_JSON` carries its 352 gates. The narrow arm is
landed and related, and the cutover is a flag day whose list is §8g; the item that actually blocks
it is the Rust witness generator, which writes 352 values per permutation and would have to write
141. Keeping the wide arm after the cutover would be the two-shapes-that-agree-today error — it
stays only until §8g's list is discharged, and this is the note that says so. -/

/-! ## §8 — ⚑⚑ **THE NARROW EMISSION**: the same permutation, 141 committed lanes instead of 352.

§7 used to close by declining this, verbatim — *"a cheaper circuit would be a DIFFERENT circuit"*.
It is a different circuit, and it is the one to run. **211 of the wide arm's 352 committed lanes
(59.9%) carry no nonlinearity at all**, and §8e proves that dropping them drops no constraint:

| block | wide arm | narrow arm | why |
|---|---|---|---|
| initial linear layer | 16 committed | **0** | a linear map of a seed the caller already holds |
| external round ×8 | 16 each | 16 each | S-box on all sixteen lanes — unchanged |
| **internal round ×13** | **16 each** | **1 each** | S-box on lane 0 ONLY; lanes 1..15 are affine |
| | **352** | **141** | |

Measured at 2^16 permutations on matched config (`circuit/tests/poseidon2_virtualization_measure.rs`,
`zkml-research/notes/poseidon2-virtualization.md`): **2.11× prove, 1.28× verify, 1.25× proof bytes,
2.34× committed cells**, at IDENTICAL `max_constraint_degree` — §8b pins the degree at **7 on both
arms**, on the emitted objects. Strictly Pareto; there is no trade to price. Upstream
`p3-poseidon2-air` (rev 82cfad73, `air.rs:259-278`) arithmetizes exactly this way.

## ⚑ WHICH ONE IS DEPLOYED

**`permEmission` (§5b) is deployed.** `ChipTableEmit.chipEmission` splices it, `CHIP_WIDTH` is 386,
and `CHIP_TABLE_AIR_JSON` carries its 352 gates. `permEmissionNarrow` is landed, measured and
related to it here; cutting the chip over is a flag day — see the closing note.

## ⚠ THE SHARING NODE IS A PRECONDITION HERE, NOT AN OPTIMISATION

The wide arm has a TREE spelling (`permGateBodies`) because every round's input is a bare column
read, so the tree is 140,850 nodes and §6b can use it as an agreement oracle. **The narrow arm has
no such spelling.** Its internal-round state is carried as expressions, and one internal round
multiplies a tree state by **16×** (`intLayer` reads all sixteen lanes into `sum` and once more into
lane `i`): measured on the emitted objects, `[1104, 17900, 286670, …]` for zero, one and two
internal rounds (§8b). Thirteen of them is ~5·10^18 nodes. So there is no tree twin to check the
DAG against, and the narrow arm's instruments are §8d's KAT, §8e's theorems and §8f's differential
against the value model instead.

## What is PROVED here, and what is CHECKED

* **§8e is proof, general in the state, the environment and the committed value.** The 195 dropped
  internal lanes are each a UNIT MULTIPLE of the one gate that survives, and the 16 dropped initial
  lanes are a DEFINITION rather than a constraint. Then `narrowSat_iff` /
  `narrow_accepts_exactly_the_wide_witnesses`: the narrow equation system accepts exactly the
  projections of the wide system's accepting assignments.
* **§8b/§8c/§8d/§8f are COMPILED EVALUATION** — `native_decide` + `#assert_compiled`, the same
  engine a `#guard` runs on, said out loud. Counts, layout tiling, degree, KAT agreement, teeth.
* ⚠ **One bridge is NOT closed**: that `permEmissionNarrow`'s literal gate list, resolved through
  `shareVals`, IS the equation system §8e reasons about. The gate bodies read `shr` leaves, and
  tying `shareVals`'s resolution of those indices to `nStateVal` needs a `shareVals` prefix lemma
  plus a fold invariant over the emitter's 21 steps. **That is undone work, not a boundary** — it
  is the next thing to do here. §8f case-checks it on six row windows in the meantime, which is a
  falsifier for an offset or def-index slip and is NOT a proof. -/

pin that sees both, and it is a `decide` in the kernel rather than a compiled evaluation. -/

/-! ### §8b — the emission.

An EXTERNAL round is **`roundDefs` unchanged** — the narrow arm re-uses §5b's emitter verbatim, so
nothing about the full rounds is re-authored. An INTERNAL round is the one that changes: it binds
ONE column (the post-S-box lane 0) and carries the diagonal layer's sixteen outputs as
DEFINITIONS. That is the 16:1, and it is also why the narrow arm has MORE definitions than the wide
one (1,286 against 1,078) while committing 2.5× fewer columns: a definition is a per-row field
operation, a column is a commitment.

⚠ **Lane 0 of the post-layer state is the COMMITTED column, not the S-box expression.** Feeding the
expression forward instead would be the same polynomial and would push the state to degree 7, then
49 at the next round; reading the column keeps every round's input at degree 1 and the whole arm at
degree 7. This is `p3-poseidon2-air`'s `state[0] = partial_round.post_sbox.into()`, and it is what
§8c's degree pin measures. -/

no column holds them. -/

/-! ### §8e — ⚑⚑ **THE RELATING THEOREM.** This is the safety argument, and it is not a comment.

Two halves, both general in the state, the row window and the committed value:

1. **The sixteen wide gates of an internal round are ONE gate, up to units.** Instantiate the wide
   arm's sixteen free columns at what the narrow arm computes for them — `intLayer` of the state
   with lane 0 set to the committed post-S-box value — and the `j`-th wide gate body becomes
   `c_j · δ` where `δ` is the narrow arm's single gate body and `c_j = 1` for `j ≠ 0`, `p − 1` for
   `j = 0`. Both are units mod `p`, so no single wide gate is stronger than the narrow one and all
   sixteen together are not either. **That is 13 × 15 = 195 of the 211.**
2. **The sixteen initial-block gates are a DEFINITION.** They say exactly "these sixteen columns
   equal this linear function of the seed", and nothing else. **That is the remaining 16.**

Then the equation systems: `narrowSat_iff` shows the narrow system's solutions are exactly the
projections of the unique round chain, and `narrow_accepts_exactly_the_wide_witnesses` states it
against an ARBITRARY wide-accepting assignment rather than against the canonical one — so it is not
an ∃-over-a-witness in disguise.

⚠ The value-level round functions here are DEFINED BY EVALUATING §4's emitters on a state of
sixteen numbers (`roundOutVal r xs = evalSt (valEnv xs) (roundOut r varState)`). They are the

`narrowSat_iff` would read the same if `NarrowSat` were unsatisfiable or trivially true, so both
are exhibited. The refutations probe at round 0 deliberately: `blocksVal` past a few rounds is an
integer with astronomically many bits, so a refutation deeper in the chain is not computable and a
`native_decide` that appeared to do it would be measuring something else. -/

/-! ### §8f — ⚠ THE UNPROVED BRIDGE, CASE-CHECKED.

§8e reasons about `NarrowSat` — the 141 equations. `permEmissionNarrow` emits 141 gate BODIES whose
content sits in a 1,286-entry definition list that `shareVals` resolves. **That the two are the same
system is not proved here.** It needs a `shareVals` prefix lemma (`foldl` over an append) plus a
fold invariant carrying "round `r`'s definitions start at index `base + Σ earlier`" through the
emitter's 21 steps — real work, not a boundary, and the next thing to do in this file.

Below is the falsifier that stands in for it: the EMITTED arm's verdict and the value model's
verdict, on the honest window and on five perturbed ones. An aux-offset slip, a `narrowBase` error
or a wrong `shr` index moves one and not the other. It is case-testing and it is labelled as such;
it proves nothing about all windows. -/

/-! ### §8g — ⚑ THE FLAG DAY, NAMED.

Cutting the chip over to `permEmissionNarrow` breaks these, on purpose, and each must be re-emitted
rather than reinterpreted:

* **`CHIP_WIDTH` 386 → 175** (`CHIP_AUX0` 33 + `NARROW_AUX_COLS` 141 + 1). `CHIP_MULT_NARROW`,
  `CHIP_OUT` and every derived offset in `ChipTableEmit` move with it.
* **`CHIP_TABLE_AIR_JSON` re-emits** — 391 gates → 180, 1,078 definitions → 1,286, and the
  `chipState16Table` variant with it. The AIR fingerprint changes, so **the VK rotates**; the old
  artifact must REFUSE to load, not be reinterpreted.
* **The Rust witness generator is the real work, and it does not exist yet.**
  `poseidon2_permute_aux_witness` (`circuit/src/plonky3_prover.rs:492`) writes 352 values per
  permutation; the narrow layout needs 141 — the eight external blocks plus one post-S-box lane per
  internal round. Until that lands, the cutover is not routable, and saying "the Lean is landed"
  would be the proven-in-Lean-is-not-routable error.
* **`sbox_registers: 1`** (`descriptor_ir2.rs:3524-3528`) is currently a pin describing a layout the
  chip deliberately does not use. This is the moment to make it mean something or delete it.
* **Every fixture carrying a chip trace re-generates**, and the devnet re-genesises.

The v1 hash sites (`lean_descriptor_air.rs:1754`, `POSEIDON2_PERM_AUX_COLS = 352`) are a SEPARATE
and Rust-authored spelling of the same algebra; they are debt already, and the narrow cutover does
not touch them. -/
