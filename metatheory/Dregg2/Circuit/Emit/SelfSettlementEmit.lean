# `Dregg2.Circuit.Emit.SelfSettlementEmit` — the self-settlement effect's constraint set,
# EMITTED FROM LEAN (house law #1).

**SUBSTRATE, SAID OUT LOUD.** This is a **Lean-authored AIR**: the constraint set below is a `def`
producing an `EffectVmDescriptor2`, byte-pinned by `emitVmJson2`, with forcing lemmas over the
EMITTED gates. No Rust AIR was written or extended for the settlement, and none may be — Rust's job
is to CALL `SELF_SETTLEMENT_GOLDEN`, exactly as the eventual cutover for
`Emit.EffectVmEmitTurnChainBinding.TURN_CHAIN_BINDING_GOLDEN` does.

**Shape, in one line:** `dregg-self-settlement-v1` is **26 main columns**, **20 public inputs**,
**27 constraints** (6 every-row `windowGate`s, 20 `.piBinding .first`, 1 `.proofBind`) and one
32-bit range tooth.

## ⚑ FLAG DAY — 2026-08-05: the recursion seam is EIGHT LANES WIDE, not one felt

`DescriptorIR2.ProofBind` carried `commit`/`vk`/`bound` as ONE `EmittedExpr` each while the objects
those fields name are eight felts (`circuit-prove/src/custom_proof_bind.rs::PROOF_BIND_COMMIT_WIDTH
= 8`, `custom_program_vk_hash = bytes32_to_8_limbs`). A one-felt tie is worth `2^31` — one limb of
an eight-limb digest, far below this repo's ~124-bit bar — so the three fields are LANE VECTORS now
and `ProofBind.widthOk` refuses anything narrower than `PROOF_BIND_MIN_LANES = 8`, at the compiler
and at the Rust admission door.

**What changed here, and what must be re-emitted:**

* `AGG_PI_COMMIT` is columns **9..16** (was the single column 9); `AGG_VK` is columns **17..24**
  (was 10); `SEL` moved 11 → **25**; `WIDTH` grew **12 → 26**.
* The eight commitment lanes AND the eight VK lanes are ALL public — `PI_COUNT` grew **6 → 20**
  (commitment lanes at PI 3..10, VK lanes at PI 11..18, `PI_HEIGHT_BEFORE` moved 5 → 19). A
  descriptor that declared eight lanes while exposing one would reintroduce the very defect the
  widening retired: a verifier could only cross-check a limb.
* `aggCommitBind` / `aggVkBind` are now eight `.piBinding .first` constraints EACH, so
  `settleConstraints` grew **13 → 27**.
* `SELF_SETTLEMENT_GOLDEN` is a completely different string (**2671 bytes**, was 1996). Any Rust
  consumer that embedded the old bytes must re-take it; the descriptor's canonical fingerprint,
  its VK and any devnet genesis that pinned them are stale and are re-emitted, not migrated.
* `settleProofBind`'s `vkPin`/`bound` STAY `none` and stay COUNTED (`proofBindDeclarative`) — see
  the table below.

## The split, stated before the code so it cannot be over-read

`SettleAccepts` has seven legs. Three are crypto and four are arithmetic, and a descriptor can only
be the second kind:

| leg | what it is | where it lives here |
|---|---|---|
| `engine` + `root_ok` | the child aggregate's whole-history recursion proof VERIFIES | `settleProofBind` — a `.proofBind` op, the IR's recursion primitive, guarded by the settlement selector. Its row-local `holdsAt` carries the seam; the CONTENT is `Satisfied2Custom.proofBound` / `proofBind_bound`, i.e. the SAME named native-BabyBear boundary `EngineSound` names. **Not discharged here, and not claimed to be.** ⚑ The seam ties EIGHT LANES of commitment and EIGHT of program VK, with BOTH pins DECLARED ABSENT (`vkPin`/`bound` = `none`) — a child chain's program and PI-commitment are the child's, not functions of this row, and all sixteen lanes are PI-bound so a verifier can compare the WHOLE objects against the recursion proof it verified. |
| `cert_ok` | a genuine super-ratification quorum over the child's finalized head | **NOT in this descriptor.** The finality rule is `BlocklaceFinality.finalLeaderAt`/`isSuperRatified` over a lace — a separate AIR. Named residual; this descriptor carries the cert's finalized root as a column and binds the SEAM only. |
| `genesis_ok` | the child's public genesis IS the account's registered genesis | `genesisPin` |
| `bound` | agg final root = cert finalized root = shown root | `aggBinds`, `certBinds` |
| `height_is_count` | the claimed height is the aggregate's public `numTurns` | `heightIsCount` |
| `monotone` | the height strictly advances | `strictAdvance` + the `HEIGHT_SLACK` range tooth |
| `applySettle` | the account write itself | `aggBinds`/`certBinds` write the root, `heightIsCount` writes the height, `registrationFrozen` freezes the registered genesis |

So what this descriptor FORCES is: **the L1 account write is exactly the child aggregate's published,
proof-bound commitments — no other value can be written.** A prover cannot settle a root the child
aggregate did not publish, cannot re-home the account's registered genesis, cannot claim a height
other than the published turn count, and cannot fail to advance. What it does NOT force is that the
published commitments are honest — that is the recursion leg (`.proofBind`) and the quorum leg (out
of scope), both named above.

`AGG_NUM_TURNS` is worth one sentence: it is a genuinely constrained quantity only because the
chain-binding AIR pins it (`EffectVmEmitTurnChainBinding.lastRealCountBind`,
`real_count[last] = pi[num_turns]`) and — since 2026-07-28 — the MODEL carries that pin across
(`EngineSound.binding_sound`'s count leg, `AggregateAttests.turns_pinned`). Before that repair,
`heightIsCount` would have been a gate tying the settled height to a free register.

## One row per settlement

`applySettle` is a single write, so this is a ONE-ROW AIR and every pin is `.first`. There is no
inter-row law, hence no `onTransition` gate anywhere: the arithmetic gates are every-row
`windowGate`s with `onTransition := false`, for the same reason `EffectVmEmitTurnChainBinding`'s
`isRealBoolean` is — a v2 `.base (.gate …)` is evaluated by `Ir2Air` under `when_transition()` and
would be VACUOUS on the last row, which for a one-row trace is the only row. Getting that wrong
would emit a descriptor that constrains nothing at all.

## Proof ladder

* Rung 0: shape + byte-golden (`SELF_SETTLEMENT_GOLDEN`), plus `settleSeam_widthOk` — the seam
  meets the lane floor, decided on the op the golden pins.
* Rung 1: `settle_descriptor_refines_air` — a satisfying window forces every one of the twenty-six
  field-level sites (`SettleAirRow`).
* Rung 2: `settle_descriptor_iff_air` — equivalence, so no constraint is added, omitted, or carried
  as unconstrained metadata.
* The BRIDGE: `settle_row_forces_settle_legs` — at canonical (non-wrapping) column values a
  satisfying row forces the ℤ-level `genesis_ok` / `bound` / `height_is_count` / `monotone` facts
  `SettleAccepts` demands, and `settle_row_writes_applySettle` reads `applySettle`'s account write
  off the very same row.
* Teeth: a fabricated child genesis, a proof/shown-root mismatch, a cert/shown-root mismatch and a
  stale height are each formally UNSAT against the emitted gates.
* Non-vacuity: `honestSettleRow_satisfies` is a concrete satisfying row and
  `honest_row_forces_legs` fires the bridge on it. Every one of the sixteen seam lanes carries a
  DISTINCT non-zero value (commitment `777..784`, VK `888..895`), so no lane equation reads `0 = 0`.

`#assert_axioms`-clean (⊆ {propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}); no `sorry`, no `native_decide`.

/-- **Rung 2 (semantic equivalence).** The emitted descriptor's FULL constraint set is equivalent to
the exact field-level settlement semantics. No constraint is added, omitted, or carried only as
unconstrained metadata. ⚑ 2026-08-04: the `.proofBind` leg is no longer `True` row-locally — it
carries the recursion seam. `settleSeam` declares BOTH pins absent (`vkPin`/`bound` = `none`,
because a settlement row binds a CHILD chain's aggregate and neither half is a function of this
row), so what survives row-locally is the selector booleanity, which `selBoolean` already forces.
That is why the equivalence still holds with the seam's own conjuncts absent from `SettleAirRow`:
the seam adds no NEW row-local fact here, and the recursion content is still the separate
`Satisfied2Custom` obligation. ⚑ 2026-08-05: `SettleAirRow` grew by SIXTEEN conjuncts anyway — one
per newly published seam lane — because the lanes' PI bindings are ordinary constraints and the
equivalence would be false if they were not transcribed. -/
