# Dregg2.Circuit.Emit.ShieldedNoteAppendDescriptor — L2: the Lean-authored IN-AIR APPEND
  GROW-GATE for the **shielded-note accumulator** (`cell/src/shielded_note_set.rs`), so that
  `ShieldedNoteSet::root8()` is trustworthy as the `piCOMMITTED` source that closes seam #15.

## ⚑ THE GROUND-TRUTH FINDING FIRST: the grow-gate ALREADY GENERALIZES; L2 is the INSTANCE
   plus the one thing the three cleartext families do not have — the HIDING leaf.

`docs/DESIGN-shielded-apex-tree-reconciliation.md` §6 L2 asks for "the Lean-authored in-AIR append
grow-gate, generalizing the `ShieldedWholeNoteSwapSubstrate` aafi32 append". Reading the record
first (`feedback-orient-from-the-record`), there are TWO already-landed generic append laws, and
between them they cover the whole of the append semantics the shielded set needs:

  * **The SET-LEVEL 8-felt insert gate** — `Emit.AccumulatorInsertEmit`. `effAccumInsertV3` is a
    PARAMETRIC descriptor constructor over `(groupCol, keyCol, valueCol, sel, base, name)`, and
    `effAccumInsertV3_forces_write8` proves `Satisfied2 ⟹ accumInserts8` over the FULL committed
    8-felt BEFORE/AFTER root groups — never lane-0. `accumInserts8` IS "the AFTER tree is the
    BEFORE tree plus exactly this leaf": key FRESH in BEFORE (no duplicate), spliced `(key, value)`
    leaf PRESENT in AFTER, and the committed key set grows by EXACTLY `key` in sorted order
    (`update_sound8`). It is explicitly "parametric over the 3 families" — nullifier, commitments,
    cells (`RotatedKernelRefinementCapFamily` §J′ instantiates all three).
    **The shielded-note set is the FOURTH family.**
  * **The PHYSICAL two-path AAFI append law** — `MapOpsColumnLayout.aafiInsert_forces_imtInsert`
    (the same aafi32 append shape the substrate descriptor emits, but DEPTH-GENERIC and
    VALUE-GENERIC): an accepting AAFI row forces the committed digest vector to change at EXACTLY
    two positions (low-`nextAddr := k`, append at a distinct FREE slot), with the pointer bracket
    `low.addr < k < low.next` surviving. Instantiated at `dep := HEAP_TREE_DEPTH = 16` and the
    HIDING value `0`, that is precisely "appended at the next AAFI free index, no prior leaf
    rewritten, none dropped, no shift".

So this module does NOT re-author tree combinatorics, a Merkle chain, or a second append law.
What it DOES author is the part that genuinely does not exist yet:

  1. **`effShieldedNoteAppendV3`** — the shielded family's descriptor: `effAccumInsertV3` plus the
     **HIDING-LEAF ZERO PIN** on the leaf's value column. The three deployed families all key a
     value-CARRYING leaf (`split_u64(value).0` — a cleartext note value / revocation height); the
     shielded leaf is `HeapLeaf::entry(fold(commitment), 0)` and MUST carry no cleartext value
     (`shielded_note_set.rs:266-283`, DESIGN §3 R1 "with no cleartext value column"). That pin is a
     NEW in-AIR constraint with no analogue in the cleartext families, and it is exactly what makes
     R2 (reusing `note_commitments`, whose value column is load-bearing) unsound.
  2. **`shieldedAppends8`** — the shielded append relation (`accumInserts8` at value `0`) and its
     soundness consequences: growth-by-exactly-the-commitment, prior leaves preserved, no duplicate,
     the appended leaf hiding.
  3. **The rejection teeth** — a cleartext value smuggled into the leaf is UNSAT; a duplicate append
     is UNSAT; a dropped prior leaf is UNSAT; a FROZEN after-root (`after = before`) is UNSAT
     unconditionally.
  4. **The completeness / non-vacuity demo** — an honest append of a fresh hiding commitment
     SATISFIES and strictly grows the committed key set (so the gate is not a DoS), plus two-sided
     `#guard` canaries on the hiding pin itself.

Why NOT a second bespoke depth-16 descriptor mirroring `ShieldedWholeNoteSwapSubstrateDescriptor`
column-for-column: that descriptor's geometry is hard-wired (`DEPTH := 32`, 16-lane keys, a 16-lane
wide binding, the market-swap/nullifier payload) and is not parameterisable to the depth-16 3-felt
`heap_root.rs` IMT leaf the L0 accumulator actually commits. Re-authoring it would duplicate an
append law that is already proven generically and would put the shielded set on a SECOND tree
encoding — the DESIGN §7 Q2 "one committed tree encoding" mistake. L0 already chose the encoding
(`CanonicalHeapTree8`, `shielded_note_set.rs:297-308`); this module gates THAT tree.

## The soundness statement, at the resolution it actually holds

`shieldedNoteAppend_forces_grow8`: a satisfying `effShieldedNoteAppendV3` trace, on an active row,
with the realizable non-membership bracket + the two spine bindings, FORCES

    accumInserts8 S8 beforeRoot (loc keyCol) 0 afterRoot

over the FULL committed 8-felt BEFORE/AFTER root groups — i.e. the committed key set of AFTER is
EXACTLY that of BEFORE plus the appended commitment key, the appended leaf carries value `0`, and
the appended key was ABSENT from BEFORE. The `0` is TRACE-FORCED (`shieldedAppend_forces_hiding_leaf`),
not assumed.

## Floors and residuals — NAMED, not laundered

FLOORS (legitimate, the same family every landed accumulator module carries):
  * `Poseidon2SpongeCR` — the sponge/`mapNode` collision-resistance the §5 physical AAFI law rides
    (`aafiInsert_forces_imtInsert`); the same floor `MapOpsColumnLayout` / `IndexedMerkleTree` /
    every deployed map-op stands on.
  * `SpineCommits8` / `GapOpen8` — the realizable spine↔root binding and the pred/succ bracket, a
    HYPOTHESIS (the deployed `compute_canonical_heap_root_8` fold), never an axiom. Same status as
    in `AccumulatorInsertEmit` and the three deployed families.
  * `PreRootModelsChain` — the NAMED, differential-checkable `xs = imtLayout phys ∧ phys ~ c`
    layout faithfulness the §5 `_layout` bridge consumes (not a free membership).

RESIDUALS (NOT closed here, per the DESIGN §6 lane table):
  * **L1** — landing `ShieldedNoteSet::root8()` as a rotation carrier BASE LIMB is a VK epoch that
    re-baselines the whole rotated cohort. This module is parametric over `groupCol`, so it holds
    for whatever limb L1 lands; it does NOT choose one, and NO deployed descriptor bytes change.
  * **L4** — routing `apply_shielded_transfer` through this gate and sourcing `piCOMMITTED` from
    `root8()`. Until then the gate constrains nothing deployed.
  * The sort key is the LOSSY `fold_bytes32_to_bb(commitment)` (~31-bit) — as for ALL FOUR sibling
    accumulators (`shielded_note_set.rs:38-45` says so). The ROOT is 8 felts; the KEY is not. The
    key-widening path exists (`SortedTreeInsertWide8` at `K := Digest8Key`) and is composed with
    here at `K := ℤ` (§4), but the deployed key stays the folded felt.
  * The AAFI `seq` column L0 persists is the ORDER-DEPENDENT replay layer; `root8()` itself is the
    SORTED-COMPACTED, order-INDEPENDENT root (`shielded_note_set.rs:78-85, 217-236`). §1-§3 gate the
    sorted spine; §5 gates the physical append-at-free-index. Both are needed and both are here.
  * §6's completeness/non-vacuity witness lives at the `[LinearOrder K]`-GENERIC `SpineCommitsW`
    wrapper (`Root := Bool`, the exact level `SortedTreeInsertWide8`'s own landed `insOpens` demo
    uses), NOT at a concrete `Heap8Scheme`. That is deliberate and stated rather than papered over: a
    concrete `SpineCommits8` inhabitant at a REAL Poseidon2 scheme is a collision-resistance-strength
    claim about which leaves open, not something a Lean term can exhibit. What §6 does establish is
    that the grow-gate's SET-LEVEL relation genuinely FIRES on an honest append and genuinely
    EXCLUDES a value-carrying leaf — so the teeth are not vacuous and the gate is not a DoS.

## Axiom hygiene
`#assert_axioms` ⊆ {propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}. NEW file; every import read-only. No
`sorry`/`admit`/`native_decide`. BYTE-SAFE: a NEW descriptor constructor and new theorems only —
`effAccumInsertV3` and every deployed descriptor are untouched (`shieldedAppend_is_additive`).

/-! ## §0 — the HIDING-LEAF ZERO PIN: the one in-AIR constraint the three cleartext families lack.

The sibling accumulators key a VALUE-CARRYING leaf — the noteCreate grow-gate literally reads
`split_u64(value).0` out of the leaf. A shielded note MUST NOT reveal its value, so its leaf is
`HeapLeaf::entry(fold(commitment), 0)`: the folded commitment as sort key, and a **ZERO value
column**. This section pins that column IN-AIR, so a prover cannot smuggle a cleartext value (or
any other side-channel felt) into the committed shielded leaf. -/

/-- **`hidingZeroBody sel valueCol`** — the HIDING pin body: the accumulator leaf's VALUE column is
`0`. `sel = none` pins it unconditionally; `sel = some s` gates the pin on the effect's runtime
selector column `s` (`s · value = 0`), exactly the `AccumulatorInsertEmit.bindGateI` discipline —
ACTIVE on the firing row (`s = 1`), vacuous on padding. -/

shielded growth is literally an instance of the landed generic keystone, not a parallel re-proof)
and carries the sortedness-preservation corollary. It also fixes, as a definitional fact, that the
deployed ℤ splice `sortedInsert` IS the generic `sortedInsertW` — the bridge the key-widening
follow-up (`K := Digest8Key`) will ride when the ~31-bit `fold_bytes32_to_bb` sort key is retired. -/

`aafi_next_free_index`); its in-AIR gate is the landed depth-generic two-path AAFI law, which this
section INSTANTIATES at `dep := HEAP_TREE_DEPTH` and the hiding value `0`. This is where "appended
at the NEXT AAFI free index, with no prior leaf rewritten and none dropped" becomes a theorem: the

before. A satisfying honest transition genuinely MOVES the committed root. -/

including the newly appended one — carries a ZERO value column. The committed shielded tree reveals
no note value. -/

/-- **★ THE APPENDED LEAF IS THE HIDING LEAF.** `(cmNew, 0)` — the `HeapLeaf::entry(fold(cm), 0)`
shape `shielded_note_set.rs::accumulator_leaf` builds — genuinely opens against the AFTER root. -/

/-- **★ A VALUE-CARRYING LEAF NEVER OPENS.** The same commitment key with a NON-ZERO value column is
NOT a member of the committed shielded tree — the hiding discipline is a genuine exclusion, not a
convention. -/
