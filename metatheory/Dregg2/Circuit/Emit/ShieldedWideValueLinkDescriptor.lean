# Dregg2.Circuit.Emit.ShieldedWideValueLinkDescriptor — the WIDE (8-felt) value binding:
# residual #17's STRUCTURAL half, in the AIR.

**This is Lean-authored AIR.** This module authors the algebra; Rust parses the emitted IR2
bytes and supplies witnesses — it constructs no constraints. It is the §D STRUCTURAL lane the
spend-circuit port named (`ShieldedSpendPortResidual` §D / "Named residual"): the deployed
`value_binding` is a ONE-FELT (~31-bit) Poseidon2 squeeze (`spend_circuit.rs` C7a,
`hash_fact(value, [asset, randomness, 0])`), and a 1-felt tag over a `u64 × u64 × felt`
opening space is STRUCTURALLY collidable — `narrow_binding_collision_exists` below PROVES
(pigeonhole, no crypto) that EVERY BabyBear-bounded 1-felt binding admits two distinct
canonical openings with the same tag; a birthday search finds one in ~2^15.5 queries. This
module widens the binding to the FULL 8-lane Poseidon2 squeeze over a faithful multi-limb
value/asset encoding, so forging a binding requires a genuine wide-Poseidon2 collision.

## What this descriptor IS (`shieldedWideValueLinkDesc`)

One clearing slot per trace row, the WIDE twin of `shieldedValueLinkDesc` (lane 2). Per row,
from the SAME witness cells:

* **(a) faithful multi-limb inputs.** `value` and `asset` each ride FOUR 16-bit limbs
  (`wide_value_binding.rs` `U64_LIMBS`/`LIMB_BITS`), range-checked IN the descriptor
  (`ranges`, the range-table tooth) — the full `u64` is representable, nothing aliases mod p
  before hashing. Two recomposition gates pin the compatibility felts
  `value_mod_p = Σ 2^{16i}·v_i`, `asset_mod_p = Σ 2^{16i}·a_i` (the `u64_recompose` shape).
* **(b) the WIDE value binding, chip-bound.** An 8-lane wide chip lookup
  (`chipLookupTupleN` — the `chip_lookup_sound_N` wide lever, Phase B-ROTATION) forces the 8
  digest columns to the FULL squeezed output `permOut [DOMAIN, v0..v3, a0..a3, randomness, 0]`
  of the genuine permutation (domain-separated: `"VBN0"`, `wide_value_binding.rs:47`; the
  trailing zero lands the site on the chip AIR's arity-11 row, the `wireCommitR8` final-chunk
  discipline). All 8 lanes are PI-pinned — the published binding IS 8 felts.
* **(c) the leaf link.** `leaf_commit = hash_fact(value_mod_p, [asset_mod_p, owner,
  randomness])` stays the deployed narrow fact site (the note tree is the narrow tree until
  the Ristretto-retire deploy), over the SAME recomposed cells — so the wide binding and the
  membership leaf share ONE opening; the narrow hash is the HEAD (lane 0) of the same
  permutation (`headHash`), exactly the deployed `hash_many` = `state[0]` relationship.
* **(d) Σ-conservation over the multi-limb value.** The cumulative column folds
  `value_mod_p − out_val` — and `value_mod_p` is (a)'s recomposition of exactly the limbs the
  WIDE digest absorbs, so the conserved value is the value the 8-felt binding binds. No
  second free value to decouple.

## What is PROVED here

* **`wide_value_link_bound`** — the keystone, `value_link_bound` re-derived over the 8-felt
  binding: a `Satisfied2` trace forces, on EVERY row, the 8 wide-binding cells to the genuine
  full-width squeeze of the limb cells, the leaf commit to the genuine narrow fact digest of
  the SAME recomposed cells, both recompositions, and 16-bit-canonical limbs; row 0 pins all
  8 binding lanes + the leaf to the PIs.
* **`wide_conservation_holds` / `wide_mint_unbalanced_unsat`** — the in-AIR Σ-fold over the
  recomposed multi-limb value ≡ Σ out (mod p), and the mint tooth.
* **`wide_decoupled_unsat`** — publishing a lane-0 PI that is not the genuine wide digest of
  the leaf's own limbs is UNSAT.
* **`narrow_binding_collision_exists`** — THE STRUCTURAL REFUTATION of the 1-felt shape:
  every BabyBear-bounded 1-felt binding has two DISTINCT canonical openings with equal tags
  (pigeonhole over 2^32 openings vs p < 2^31 tags; the birthday attack finds such a pair in
  ~2^15.5). No hypothesis — the narrow floor is not weak, it is UNSATISFIABLE.
* **`wide_binding_binds`** — THE PAYOFF: under the NAMED wide floor (`WideBindingCR`), two
  satisfying traces publishing the SAME 8-felt binding open the SAME (value-limbs,
  asset-limbs, randomness) — same `u64` value — so their conserved values agree.
  **`birthday_collision_no_longer_forges`** composes the two: every 1-felt binding admits a
  canonical collision pair, and on ANY such pair the 8-felt binding still separates.

## The NAMED floor (legitimate, and shown non-vacuous)

`WideBindingCR permOut` — injectivity of the 8-lane squeeze ON CANONICAL OPENINGS ONLY
(limbs < 2^16, randomness < p). This is deliberately NOT the deleted-FALSE
`Poseidon2WideCR` (`∀ xs ys` over infinite `List ℤ` — pigeonhole-refuted,
VACUITY-SWEEP FINDING 2): the canonical opening space has ~2^159 elements while the 8-felt
range has ~p^8 ≈ 2^248, so counting does NOT refute this floor —
`wideBindingCR_satisfiable` exhibits a width-8 inhabitant (`packPerm`), where the SAME
statement at 1 felt is REFUTED outright by `narrow_binding_collision_exists`. That is the
entire point of the widening. For real Poseidon2 the floor is standard wide-output CR
(collisions exist beyond the canonical domain; finding a canonical-domain collision is the
priced game — `InjectiveFloorRegrounded.wireCommitR8_binds_advantage_bound` is the
advantage-bounded form of the same family).

## What this lane does NOT close (named honestly)

* **The Ristretto-retire deploy** (#17's other half): retiring `commit_hidden_asset`
  (Shor-broken DLog) and routing `apply_shielded_transfer` through the ring-clearing apex is
  Rust + descriptor-JSON golden regen + VK regen — the deploy lane, NOT this file.
* The NOTE TREE is still the narrow 1-felt leaf tree; `leaf_commit` here is the
  compatibility join. Precommitting the wide carrier at note creation is part of the deploy.
* The ℤ-integer conservation lift still rides the named `VALUE_BITS` range residual (the
  limbs are canonical, but Σ over many rows can wrap mod p — same residual as lane 2).
* The mod-p pins are field-faithful; exactness at the junctions uses the deployed
  canonical-BabyBear-representative discipline (`hOutCanon`/pub-canonicity hypotheses in
  `wide_binding_binds` — representation facts of the deployed encoder, not crypto).

## Axiom hygiene

Definitional descriptor + both-polarity teeth + explicit satisfying witness; crypto floor
enters as the NAMED hypothesis `WideBindingCR` (satisfiability PROVED, narrow counterpart
REFUTED), never an axiom. `#assert_axioms` ⊆ {propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}.
