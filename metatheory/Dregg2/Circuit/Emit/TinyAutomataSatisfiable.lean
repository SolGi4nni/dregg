⚠ SCOPE OF THE COST LAW BELOW (an adversarial verify checked this; read before quoting §7).

WITNESSED (a satisfying `Satisfied2Public` trace exists, so the cost is the cost of a PROVABLE object):
  * product-first at k = 1, 2, 3, 4 — `prodRunWit_satisfies`, general in k.
  * lanes at k = 1 (identical object to product) and k = 2 — `lanesRunI2_satisfies`.
MEASURED BUT **NOT** WITNESSED: lanes at k = 3 and k = 4. `lanes2Wit_satisfies` is hard-coded to TWO
lanes by construction; the k-lane generalisation is obvious but WAS NOT BUILT. Those two points are
cost-of-an-emitted-object, not cost-of-a-provable-object — the exact distinction whose absence got the
previous file's headline retracted. Quote them as such.

The crossover claim survives that scope: BOTH ENDPOINTS of the k=1 tie and the k=2 strict win are
witnessed on both routes, which is what the previous retraction demanded. The k=3,4 lanes numbers
strengthen an already-witnessed direction; they do not carry it.

ALSO NOT WITNESSED (and openly so): the reachability-minimised WHOLE-GRAPH product costs (area
12/36/72/150). The Eulerian obstruction stands there — no satisfying trace is known for any k. They are
quoted only as the price of the attestation the run-table discipline does not buy, never as a crossover.
# Dregg2.Circuit.Emit.TinyAutomataSatisfiable — the REPAIR of the composition experiment:
a genuinely-independent tiny-automaton family, the RUN-table discipline, and — the deliverable —
a REAL `Satisfied2Public` WITNESS for a COMPOSED descriptor.

**This is Lean-authored AIR.** The composed descriptors are `EffectVmDescriptor2` values authored
here (via `DfaRoutingTableEmit.tableRoutingDesc`); the witness is a concrete `VmTrace`; the
satisfaction is a theorem over the EMITTED object. Rust parses the emitted IR2 bytes and supplies
witnesses; it authors nothing.

## What this file repairs

`TinyAutomataCompose.lean` measured a cost law over descriptors NO PROVER CAN SATISFY. Its own
retraction header names the three defects; this file fixes each:

  * **(a) A DEGENERATE FAMILY.** `fam k` alternated only TWO machines, so the `k`-fold product's
    REACHABLE state space was 4 for every `k` while `tableOf` tabulated `2^k` (504/512 dead rows at
    `k = 8`). Here the family is FOUR pairwise non-isomorphic machines — count-mod-2, count-mod-3,
    ends-in-1, contains-the-factor-01 — and §2's reachability census MEASURES the product's
    reachable space growing 2 → 6 → 12 → 25 over `k = 1…4`.
  * **(b) THE EULERIAN OBSTRUCTION.** A whole-graph `exactPublicRows` table forces the run to be an
    EULERIAN path through the declared multigraph (`TinyAutomataCompose`'s
    `tableRouting_traverses_each_declared_row_once` + `forced_trace_length`), and the previous
    family's components had DISJOINT Eulerian word sets. This file uses the RUN-TABLE discipline:
    the descriptor declares exactly the `|w|` edges the run traverses, in order, so the
    exact-multiset permutation obligation is discharged BY CONSTRUCTION — `runWit_lookupLog` is an
    EQUALITY, hence `List.Perm.refl`.
  * **(c) NO WITNESS EXISTED.** §4's `runWit_satisfies` is a GENERAL construction — for ANY
    `TableDfa`, start state and non-empty word — of a `VmTrace` that PROVABLY satisfies the emitted
    `tableRoutingDesc name (runTable d q w)`. §5 fires it on the COMPOSED product descriptors at
    `k = 1, 2, 3, 4` and pushes it through `TinyAutomataCompose.productDesc_refines_components`, so
    the witness's exposed public `final_state` PROVABLY decodes to every component automaton's own
    classification of the word the trace reads.

§6 adds the second satisfiable route (a 2-lane witness), so the `k = 2` comparison is between two
families that BOTH have witnesses. §7 states the measured law.

## Axiom hygiene

`#assert_axioms` ⊆ {propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound} on every theorem. NEW file; imports
read-only (nothing in `TinyAutomataCompose` or `DfaRoutingTableEmit` is edited). Every `#guard` is
COMPILED EVALUATION of a closed `Bool` — it proves NO `Prop`; it pins measured numbers and nothing
more. The load-bearing objects are the theorems.

/-! ## §1 — FOUR GENUINELY INDEPENDENT tiny automata (defect (a), fixed).

The previous family alternated two machines, so the product collapsed. These four are pairwise
non-isomorphic — two of them have three states, and no two agree on all of {state count, whether
the state resets on every symbol, whether there is an absorbing state}. Every step function is
TOTAL on `ℕ` and lands strictly below `IRADIX = 4`, which is the uniform digit width the mixed-radix
product encoding (`TinyAutomataCompose.prodListDfa`) needs. -/

/-! ## §2 — THE REACHABILITY CENSUS: the product state space GENUINELY grows.

The previous family's product had 4 reachable states at EVERY `k`; the "exponential" it measured
was 504/512 dead rows. Here the reachable set is COMPUTED (a saturating BFS over the two symbols)
and it grows. ⚠ Every `#guard` in this file is COMPILED EVALUATION of a closed `Bool` — it proves
NO `Prop`. -/

/-! ## §3 — THE RUN-TABLE WITNESS CONSTRUCTION (defects (b) and (c), fixed).

`TinyAutomataCompose.runTable d q w` declares exactly the `|w|` edges the run traverses, in order,
with multiplicity. The trace below reads exactly those edges in exactly that order, so the
unit-capacity LogUp receive's permutation obligation is an EQUALITY — the Eulerian obstruction is
discharged by construction rather than searched for. -/

theorem that it satisfies that COMPOSED descriptor — the object `TinyAutomataCompose` never built.
`prodRunWit_exposes_components` then pushes the witness through the composition-soundness theorem:
the witness's exposed public `final_state` IS the mixed-radix packing of EVERY component
automaton's classification of the word the trace reads (and that word IS `w`). -/

/-! ## §6 — THE SECOND SATISFIABLE ROUTE: a 2-LANE witness.

`TinyAutomataCompose`'s lanes route was the one its retraction proved VACUOUS at `k ≥ 2` (each
lane's whole-graph table forced its own Eulerian path, and the components' Eulerian word sets were
disjoint). Under the RUN-table discipline the obstruction disappears for lanes too: each lane
declares exactly its own run over the SHARED word, so each lane's lookup log is that lane's run
table by construction. This section builds the witness, so the `k = 2` cost comparison of §7 is
between two families that BOTH have one. -/

/-! ## §7 — ⚑ THE COST LAW, over families that HAVE WITNESSES.

Everything below is READ OFF the emitted descriptors by `TinyAutomataCompose.costOf` / `jsonBytes`,
at the fixed 8-symbol probe word. ⚠ `#guard` is compiled evaluation and proves NO `Prop`; the
`Prop`-level content is `prodRunWit_satisfies` / `lanes2Wit_satisfies` (the witnesses),
`forced_trace_length` (why a declared table pins the trace length, hence AREA) and
`productDesc_refines_components` (why the composed verdict is sound).

**What is WITNESSED.** Product-first at `k = 1, 2, 3, 4` (`prodRunWit_satisfies`, general in `k`);
parallel-lanes at `k = 2` (`lanesRunI2_satisfies`). At `k = 1` the two routes are the same 3-column
object. So both endpoints of the claimed crossover carry a satisfying trace. -/

/-! ### The law, stated

At a fixed word length `|w|`, under the RUN-table discipline (the only one with witnesses):

  * **product-first** — `traceWidth 3`, `4` constraints, `2` PIs, `1` table of `|w|` rows,
    `0` nonlinear multiplications, AREA `3·|w|`. INDEPENDENT of `k`. Witnessed at `k = 1…4`.
  * **parallel lanes** — `traceWidth 1 + 2k`, `4k` constraints, `2k` PIs, `k` tables of `|w|` rows,
    `0` nonlinear multiplications, AREA `(1 + 2k)·|w|`. Witnessed at `k = 2`.
  * TIE in AREA at `k = 1` (24 = 24 — the two routes are the same 3-column object there);
    product-first strictly cheaper for every `k ≥ 2`, on EVERY axis measured — AREA (24 vs 40, 56,
    72), constraints (4 vs 8, 12, 16), PIs (2 vs 4, 6, 8) and wire bytes (654/665/670 vs 1153, 1649,
    2145). There is NO axis on which lanes win: even at `k = 1` the lanes descriptor is 3 bytes
    larger (657 vs 654), from the longer table name. The `TinyAutomataCompose` headline — "lanes
    win at every `k ≥ 2`, AREA crossover `k = 2`" — is exactly inverted once both sides are
    satisfiable, and its own §4b already predicted this flip for run tables.

What product-first costs is ATTESTATION, exactly as `TinyAutomataCompose` §4b said and this file
does not repair: a run table commits the edges TRAVERSED, not the automaton, so "which product
automaton ran" must be bound elsewhere. The whole-graph declaration buys that binding — at 12 → 150
area over `k = 1…4` even after reachability minimisation, and with NO witness in hand. -/
