# Dregg2.Circuit.Emit.TurnAuthLamportEmit — AUTHORIZATION INSIDE THE AIR.

**SUBSTRATE, SAID OUT LOUD: this is Lean-authored AIR.** Every constraint below is produced by a
`def`-GENERATOR over `AirBuilder.Head` / `VmConstraint2` / the deployed wide chip lookup
(`chipLookupTupleN`), and the teeth are FORCING LEMMAS over the emitted object. Rust only CONSUMES
the emitted descriptor. No constraint here is hand-written in Rust, and none may be.

## The hole this closes

Measured 2026-07-30: **nothing in the deployed AIR binds a signature, and for the owner path nothing
binds a capability either.** The table census over the whole deployed registry is `{main,
poseidon2_chip, poseidon2_state16_chip, range, memory, map_ops, umemory, umem_boundary}` — no curve
table, no signature table. All signature verification is host-side ed25519 `verify_strict`
(`turn/src/executor/authorize.rs`). The cap-open crown IS real in-AIR membership, but its `auth_tag`
is pinned to the constant `SIGNATURE_AUTH_TAG = 1` — a TIER BYTE, not a signature check. And
`transferCapOpenTB`'s turn-identity weld publishes `actor` and `dst` to PI 47/48 from columns NO
OTHER CONSTRAINT MENTIONS (`CapOpenTurnPins` §5 reports exactly this).

So a turn's proof was a WELL-FORMEDNESS certificate for a state transition, not a PERMISSION
certificate: "these two committed states are related by a legal balance move", never "the owner asked
for it, on this cell, to that recipient".

## Why THIS mechanism (chosen on SOUNDNESS, and the alternatives rejected on soundness)

The requirement is exact: **the PROVER must be unable to forge, and the prover is not the owner.**
The host builds the trace; the owner is offline. That single fact decides the design.

* **A preimage/MAC authenticator is REFUTED, not merely expensive.** "The AIR forces knowledge of a
  preimage of the cell's committed owner key" sounds like authorization, but the prover must HOLD
  that preimage to lay the trace. A prover holding the authenticating secret can authenticate any
  turn it likes. Every commit-and-open, hash-ratchet, or nonce-chain variant inherits this: whatever
  the AIR forces the prover to know, the prover knows, and can therefore re-use for a different
  turn. Authority that the prover can mint is not authority.

* **A receipt/nonce chain is necessary but not sufficient.** Inheriting authority from a checked
  predecessor answers "is this turn NEXT", never "did anyone authorize the FIRST one" — an
  origination act is still required at every link, or the chain is a chain of unauthorized turns.
  (Replay/ordering is handled here by the message binding, which includes the turn's own identity.)

* **The cap-open crown alone is REFUTED.** Merkle membership is a statement about a PUBLIC tree. A
  path is public data; anyone who can read the cap root can produce a membership witness for any leaf
  in it. Membership proves the capability EXISTS and WHAT it permits — it never proves WHO invoked
  it. That is precisely why routing owner effects through the existing crown, on its own, does not
  fix the owner path: it would move the hole, not close it.

  So the crown is KEPT (it binds which cap and what it permits) and this module supplies the missing
  half: WHO.

* **Therefore: an in-AIR SIGNATURE verification.** A signature is the unique primitive where signing
  is separable from proving: the owner signs offline and hands the prover `(message, signature)`; the
  prover holds no signing power.

* **The scheme is a HASH-BASED one-time signature over the deployed Poseidon2 chip — NOT ed25519.**
  This is a soundness choice, not a cost choice:
  1. An ed25519 verify in-AIR is NON-NATIVE field arithmetic: `Fq = 2²⁵⁵−19` over BabyBear felts. Its
     gate cross-sums reach `~2⁵⁴⁰` and OVERFLOW BabyBear, so the gates are read over ℤ — that is the
     field-width residual `Ed25519Gadget` names about itself (§"Resolution (honest)"). Building the
     ROOT OF AUTHORITY on a gate whose ℤ-reading does not match the field the prover actually
     evaluates in puts the gap at exactly the tooth that must not have one.
  2. ed25519 is CLASSICAL. The rest of this AIR's soundness floor is hash/Merkle/FRI. Binding
     authorization to ECDLP inside a post-quantum-oriented STARK makes authorization the weakest
     link in its own proof.
  3. A hash-based signature adds **no new hardness carrier at all** — its security reduces to the
     preimage/collision resistance of the SAME Poseidon2 the cap tree, the state commitment and FRI
     already ride (`Dregg2.Crypto.HashSig`'s header makes exactly this point). Native field, native
     chip, native floor, no new assumption.
  (That it is also ~3 orders of magnitude cheaper than the ~10⁷-gate ed25519 verify is a CONSEQUENCE
  of picking the native primitive, and is not the reason.)

* **One-time is the right granularity** and is not a limitation to be worked around: a turn is a
  one-shot act. The many-time lift is a Merkle tree over per-turn one-time public keys, which is the
  depth-16 crown this AIR already runs, indexed by the turn sequence.

## What is BUILT here

The gadget is `lamportAuthConstraints`, GENERATED, parametric in the block count `nb` (message width
`ell = 31·nb` bits; the deployed instance is `nb = 8`, i.e. a 248-bit message matching the deployed
8-felt digest width `CAP_W`). Every digest is an 8-FELT GROUP forced by the deployed wide chip lookup
`chipLookupTupleN` against `ChipTableSoundN` — the SAME lever the cap crown's `nodeLookup` uses, so
no new width claim and no narrower digest enters.

  1. **`sigLookups`** — per bit `k`, a wide lookup forcing `sigH k = permOut (sig k)`.
  2. **`selectGates`** — per bit `k`, per lane `j`, the degree-2 gate
     `sigH[k][j] − pk0[k][j] + m[k]·pk0[k][j] − m[k]·pk1[k][j] = 0`, i.e. `sigH k = pk k (m k)`.
  3. **`msgBitGates`** — every message bit is boolean.
  4. **`pairLookups` / `accLookups` / `authRootPins`** — the public key is FOLDED (rate-16 wide
     absorbs, `pk0‖pk1` then a running fold, exactly the cap tree's `pack8` shape) to ONE 8-felt
     authority root, PINNED to 8 public inputs. Without this the prover picks the public key and the
     verify is a tautology; with it, the light client anchors those PIs from the owner's committed
     authority root and the public key is no longer the prover's.
  5. **`turnDigestLookup`** — the `nb` message-digest felts are forced to `permOut` of the TURN
     IDENTITY columns (`src`, `actor`, `dst`, …), supplied by the caller.
  6. **`msgReconGates` + `canonGates`** — the signed bits recompose EXACTLY to those digest felts.
     31 bits per felt, and the recomposition is pinned to the CANONICAL representative by an in-AIR
     BabyBear canonicality gate (`p = 2³⁰+2²⁹+2²⁸+2²⁷+1`: if the top four bits are all set then every
     one of the low 27 bits is forced to zero), so `Σ bᵢ2ⁱ < p` and the mod-`p` recomposition gate
     collapses to ℤ equality. No second representation survives, so no `Σ ≡ digest (mod p)` residual
     is left behind.

**This is what makes `actor` and `dst` stop being free.** They are INPUTS to `turnDigestLookup`,
whose output is bit-decomposed into the very bits the signature opens. Move `dst` by one and every
message bit downstream of it changes, and the witness must then contain a Lamport preimage the owner
never revealed. The three-weld fix and the authorization fix are THE SAME ACT: the free columns are
free precisely because nothing signs them.

## The teeth

  * `lamport_verify_forced` — a satisfying witness FORCES `∀ k, permOut (sigVal k) = pkVal k (mBit k)`,
    which is DEFINITIONALLY `Dregg2.Crypto.HashSig.verify permOut pk m sig` at `D := List ℤ`. So the
    already-proved forgery tooth (`HashSig.lamport_forgery`: any verifying forgery on a message that
    differs at one bit yields a preimage or a collision) applies to the emitted object VERBATIM — no
    new reduction, no new carrier.
  * `msg_is_the_turn_digest` — the signed bits recompose to the turn-digest felts over ℤ (exactly,
    via the canonicality gate), and those felts are `permOut` of the turn-identity columns.
  * `authRoot_forced` — the folded public key is the published root.
  * `wrong_key_refused` / `unsigned_refused` / `moved_dst_refused` — the KAT teeth, both polarities,
    kernel-reduced.

## Axiom hygiene

`#assert_axioms`-clean (⊆ {propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}); no `sorry`/`admit`/
`native_decide`. The `#guard` KATs reduce in the kernel.

/-! ## §8 — the DESCRIPTOR, and `AuthCore` DISCHARGED from `Satisfied2`.

`authCore_of_satisfied` derives every `AuthCore` field from the deployed denotation on row 0. -/

/-- **`withTurnAuth base nb turnIn`** — `base` widened by the in-AIR authorization gadget: `+
AUTH_SPAN nb` columns, `+8` public inputs (the published authority root), and the gadget's
constraints appended.

⚑ **`ranges` is deliberately UNTOUCHED.** The v1 `ranges` carrier is illegal on a GRADUATED v2
descriptor — `check_descriptor2` refuses any descriptor with a non-empty `hash_sites`/`ranges`
("v2 assembly requires a GRADUATED descriptor"). An earlier draft put the message-bit booleanity
there and would have been unassemblable by the deployed prover. Booleanity comes from the emitted
`binGate` instead, lifted to ℤ by `boolGate_exact` (`p`'s primality + the canonicality envelope) —
the same route `CapOpenEmit` uses for its mask bits. -/

IDENTITY hashes to something else — because `actor` moved, or `dst` moved, or `src` moved — MUST
sign a different message bit. `actor` and `dst` are no longer publishable at will: they are
arguments of the hash whose bits the signature opens. -/

weld with the emitted verify and the already-proved Lamport tooth: a witness that signs a bit the
owner did not sign hits the hash of a preimage the owner NEVER revealed — so it either produced that
unrevealed preimage, or produced a distinct value with the same Poseidon2 image. There is no third
option, and neither is available to a prover that lacks the owner's secret. -/
