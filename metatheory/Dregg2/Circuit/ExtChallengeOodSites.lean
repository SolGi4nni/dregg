# `Dregg2.Circuit.ExtChallengeOodSites` — the QUARTIC-EXTENSION challenge typing at the remaining
OOD/RLC sites, and the EXACT relation to the base-typed forms.

## STATUS OF THIS FILE (read this before trusting any header claim below)

⚑ **UPDATED 2026-07-25 — the CUTOVER moved two of these bodies, and the header would otherwise lie.**
This file was originally additive-only.  It no longer is: the §1 OOD bridge (`OodInterpFExt` and its
landing/lift) now lives in `Dregg2.Circuit.OodInterpFieldExt` — upstream of `DeployedTraceExtract`,
which is the module that DEFINES the deployed extraction bundle whose OOD binder had to be retyped
and therefore could never have named a correction living down here — and the §2 K′ bodies
(`constraintResidualAtZetaExt`, `kprime_composeExt`, `kprime_compose_of_tableIdentityExt`,
`constraintResidualAtZetaExt_lift`) now live in `Dregg2.Circuit.KprimeCompose`, BESIDE the base-typed
declarations they correct, where the base-typed `kprime_compose` is now DERIVED from the ext one.
Both are `export`ed back here, so every `ExtChallengeOodSites.<name>` reference resolves unchanged to
the SAME constant.  There is no duplicate: what moved, moved.  What remains stated here is the
NO-DESCENT half (§1.3, §2.1) and §3–§6, which are genuinely this file's.

Sites healed here (the §1/§2 bodies as noted above; the rest in place), originally ADDITIVELY:

  * §1 `FieldIntegerLift.OodInterpF` (`:70-79`) / `ood_forces_mainAirAccept_field_of_residuals`
        (`:139`) — `ζ : BabyBear`, `Zp qp : Polynomial BabyBear`. LOAD-BEARING (it is the OOD
        landing every `MainAirAcceptF` chain in the tree bottoms out at). Counterpart
        `OodInterpFExt` / `ood_forces_mainAirAccept_field_ext` /
        `ood_forces_mainAirAccept_field_of_residuals_ext`.
  * §2 `KprimeCompose.constraintResidualAtZeta` (`:62-67`) / `kprime_compose` /
        `kprime_compose_of_tableIdentity` — `ζ α : BabyBear`. LOAD-BEARING (the composed K′ chain).
        Counterpart `constraintResidualAtZetaExt` / `kprime_composeExt` /
        `kprime_compose_of_tableIdentityExt`.
  * §3 `OodColumnLayout` (`:96-283`) — the ∀-descriptor modeler at `ζ Λ : BabyBear`. The GENERIC
        half was already repaired by `OodExtChallengeLayout` §2; what was missing is the DEPLOYED
        `transferV3` half (`:249-288`), supplied here.
  * §4 `OodSoundnessGame` `oodNonExc_soundness_error_babybear` (`:107`) /
        `rlc_debatch_error_babybear` (`:223`) — priced at `|BabyBear| = 2013265921`. VERDICT:
        UNFAITHFUL (they are the field-generic game at `F = BabyBear`, so they price a different
        object and do NOT bound the deployed event), but CONSERVATIVE IN THE NUMBER (`deg/p^4 <
        deg/p`, so nothing was reported too small). Both halves proved in §4; restated at
        `|Challenge| = |BB4| = 2013265921^4`.
  * §5 `RlcRomBound.hLam_clause_bounded_babybear` (`:298-317`) — the deployed Λ-clause ε, likewise
        priced at `|BabyBear|`. Restated at `|BB4|`, at the SAME acceptance event.

NOT done here, and named so nobody reads a closure into this file:

  * The deployed `SingleAirOpening.alpha`/`TableOpening.*` RECORD FIELDS are still ONE felt. §5
    types the declared challenge as a `BB4` element, which is the faithful typing of the STATEMENT;
    that the deployed serialized record carries four lanes is the felt-width wound
    (`docs/WOUND-felt-width-boundaries-2026-07-19.md`), untouched.
  * The FRI soundness floor is unchanged. Retyping challenges moves ε denominators; it discharges
    no FRI/STARK assumption.
  * `LogUpColumnLayout.logupChallenge` is handled in the companion file, not here.

Sorry-free; no `axiom`; no carrier; every keystone `#assert_axioms`-checked.

## ⚑ THE TRUE RELATION FOUND (investigated, not assumed)

Identical in shape to `OodExtChallengeLayout`'s finding, now at these five sites:

  * **Base witnesses LIFT, completely** (`oodInterpFExt_of_oodInterpF`,
    `constraintResidualAtZetaExt_lift`): everything transports along `algebraMap BabyBear E`,
    including both non-exceptionality side conditions. So the extension-typed hypothesis is
    strictly WEAKER.
  * **Extension witnesses do NOT descend, and the base equation cannot EXPRESS the deployed value**
    (`extOod_rhs_beyond_base`, `extOod_rhs_not_lifted`, `extResidual_beyond_base`): with a genuinely
    `Challenge`-valued quotient opening — which is exactly what the deployed `quotient : Challenge`
    is — the OOD identity's right-hand side `Z(ζ)·q(ζ)` lands OUTSIDE `Set.range (algebraMap)`,
    while every base-typed right-hand side is confined to it. Fired at the DEPLOYED `transferV3`.
  * **The consumer survives**: the extension-typed hypothesis still forces the BASE-field
    conclusion `MainAirAcceptF d t`, unchanged (`ood_forces_mainAirAccept_field_ext`,
    `kprime_composeExt`). Weaker hypothesis, identical conclusion.
  * **The ε moves in the FAVOURABLE direction and the base number was strictly looser**
    (`ext_pricing_strictly_tighter`): the faithful denominator is `p^4`, not `p`; the base-typed
    ε is a valid upper bound (so nothing was UNSOUND) but is `p^3`-times larger than the truth.

## NON-VACUITY

`fire_kprime_composeExt_nonbase` runs the whole §2 chain with BOTH challenges drawn from
`BB4 ∖ image(BabyBear)` and produces a real `MainAirAcceptF dArith tHonest`.
`fire_extOod_rhs_beyond_base_transferV3` fires §1's separation at the REAL deployed descriptor.
`fire_declaredAlphaExceptional_nonbase` exhibits a CONCRETE `BatchProofData BB4` declaring a
genuinely non-base challenge that IS exceptional, so §5's bounded event is not empty.

/-! ## §0 — the one algebraic fact the whole "no descent" half rides.

`Set.range (algebraMap BabyBear E)` is closed under the base-field operations but NOT under
multiplication by a genuine extension element: scaling a non-base element by a NONZERO base element
keeps it outside the base image. This is what makes an extension-valued quotient opening
`quotient : Challenge` inexpressible in a base-typed OOD identity. -/

/-! ## §1 — SITE `FieldIntegerLift.lean:70-79, :139` — the OOD landing at the deployed challenge
typing.

`OodInterpF` binds `ζ : BabyBear`, `Zp qp : Polynomial BabyBear`; `verifyAlgo`'s opened
`vanishingAtZeta`/`quotientAtZeta` are, in the deployed verifier, `Challenge` values
(`vendor/plonky3-fri-82cfad73/src/verifier.rs:623-640`). LOAD-BEARING: this bridge is what
`OodColumnLayout.mainAirAcceptF_of_oodLayout` and `KprimeCompose.kprime_compose` land through.

`OodInterpFExt` is the same bridge with the CHALLENGE and the QUOTIENT/VANISHING polynomials drawn
from the extension. The committed constraint polynomial stays a `Polynomial BabyBear` embedded
coefficientwise (the trace IS base-field data — that is not the wound). -/

`mainAirAcceptF_of_oodInterpF_via_ext` now live in `Dregg2.Circuit.OodInterpFieldExt`, immediately
above `FieldIntegerLift`.  Reason (the ordering problem, stated): this module sits BELOW
`DeployedTraceExtract` in the import DAG, and `DeployedTraceExtract` is the module that DEFINES the
deployed extraction bundle `DeployedTraceDecode` whose OOD binder had to be retyped — a module can
never name its own correction if the correction lives downstream of it.  Moving the bridge upstream
is what made the deployed cutover possible at all.  Re-exported here so every
`ExtChallengeOodSites.OodInterpFExt` reference resolves unchanged, to the SAME constant.  The §1.2
LIFT and the §1.3 NO-DESCENT separation below are unchanged and still stated here. -/

`Challenge`-valued quotient opening `ξ` — which is exactly what the deployed `quotient : Challenge`
IS — and a domain vanisher that does not vanish at the OOD point (it cannot: the OOD point is by
definition off the trace domain), the OOD identity's right-hand side `Z(ζ)·q(ζ)` lies OUTSIDE
`Set.range (algebraMap BabyBear E)`. So the base-typed `OodInterpF.hood` equation, whose both sides
are base-field values, is a DIFFERENT equation over a strictly smaller value space — not a
specialization of the deployed one. -/

typing.

`constraintResidualAtZeta` reads `ζ : BabyBear` and `qp : VmConstraint2 → Polynomial BabyBear`;
`kprime_compose` batches with `α : BabyBear`. Both the OOD point and the constraint-RLC challenge
are `Challenge` in the deployed verifier. LOAD-BEARING: `kprime_compose_of_tableIdentity` is the

from `kprime_composeExt` by the lift, so there is one chain and the two cannot drift.  Re-exported

`mainAirAcceptF_of_oodLayoutExt`). What it does NOT supply — and what `OodColumnLayout` §4/§5 has
at the base typing — is the DEPLOYED `transferV3` half: the membership form of the law, the law
fired at the real 147-column layout, and the RLC bad-set cap at that layout. Supplied here at the
extension typing, so the deployed descriptor's column-layout facts exist at the challenge typing the
deployed verifier actually uses. -/

/-! ## §4 — SITE `OodSoundnessGame.lean:107, :223` — the ε, priced at the REAL challenge space.

⚑ VERDICT — say which, precisely, because "conservative" is easy to launder here:

  * The underlying games are ALREADY field-generic (`{F} [Fintype F] [CommRing F] [IsDomain F]
    [DecidableEq F]`). Nothing in them is wrong. What is base-typed is only the INSTANCE:
    `oodNonExc_soundness_error_babybear` / `rlc_debatch_error_babybear` are the generic theorem at
    `F = BabyBear`.
  * That instance is therefore **UNFAITHFUL** — it prices a BabyBear-valued residual sampled from a
    BabyBear challenge space, and the deployed residual/challenge are `Challenge`-valued. It is NOT
    a bound on the deployed event at all: it is a true statement about a different object. Saying
    "the deployed ε is ≤ deg/p because `oodNonExc_soundness_error_babybear`" would be laundering.
  * It IS **CONSERVATIVE IN THE NUMBER**: for any numerator, `deg/p^4 ≤ deg/p`
    (`babybear_pricing_is_conservative`), and strictly so when the numerator is positive
    (`ext_pricing_strictly_tighter`). So the mis-typing never made a reported number too SMALL —
    the deployed ε is `p^3 ≈ 2^93` times better than the one the tree reports.
  * The repair is therefore purely additive: re-instantiate at `BB4`, the canonical deployed quartic
    extension. Nothing has to be re-proved. -/

/-! ## §5 — SITE `RlcRomBound.lean:298-317` — the deployed Λ-clause ε, at the real challenge space.

`rlc_lambda_nonexceptionality_is_bounded` is field-generic; only its `*_babybear` instances price
at `|BabyBear|`. Re-instantiated at `BB4`: the SAME acceptance event, the SAME adaptive prover, the
SAME forcing lemma — a `p^3`-times tighter and faithful bound.

⚠ SCOPE, at its real resolution: `declaredAlphaExceptional` reads `SingleAirOpening.alpha : F`. At
`F = BB4` that is the faithful TYPING of the declared challenge. The deployed serialized record
still stores ONE felt per challenge — that is the felt-width wound, adjacent to this one and NOT
repaired here. -/
