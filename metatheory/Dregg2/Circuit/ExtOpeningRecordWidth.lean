# `Dregg2.Circuit.ExtOpeningRecordWidth` — the OPENED-VALUE RECORDS at the deployed quartic width.

## The gap this file is about

Recent work retyped the deployed FRI CHALLENGES to the quartic extension where they belong (the
constraint-RLC `α`, the OOD `ζ`, every commit-phase fold `β`: `ExtFieldChallenge.lean:8-15`). It did
NOT widen the serialized RECORDS. `BatchTablesSingleAir.SingleAirOpening.alpha` and
`FriVerifier.TableOpening.constraintEval` / `vanishingAtZeta` / `quotientAtZeta` / `logupCumSum` are
still ONE felt each. This file supplies the widened records ADDITIVELY, proves what actually holds
between them and the narrow ones, and delivers the downstream payoff.

## ⚑ WHAT THE DEPLOYED SYSTEM ACTUALLY HOLDS (read in the sources, not inferred)

`Challenge = BinomialExtensionField<BabyBear, 4>` (`circuit-prove/src/dregg_outer_config.rs:153`),
and a `Challenge` reaches the transcript as FOUR base felts — `obs_ext` observes
`e.as_basis_coefficients_slice()` (`circuit-prove/src/apex_shrink_gnark_export.rs:743`).

  * `alpha` is **NOT SERIALIZED AT ALL** — it is squeezed:
    `let _alpha_constraints = rec.sample_ext()` (`apex_shrink_gnark_export.rs:1008`), and in the FRI
    layer `let alpha: Challenge = challenger.sample_algebra_element()`
    (`vendor/plonky3-fri-82cfad73/src/verifier.rs:143`). So is `zeta`
    (`apex_shrink_gnark_export.rs:1011`, `let zeta = rec.sample_ext()`).
  * `constraintEval` / `quotientAtZeta` / `vanishingAtZeta` are **NOT ON THE WIRE AS SUCH EITHER** —
    they are DERIVED `Challenge` values: the folded constraint from the serialized `trace_local` /
    `trace_next` openings (all `Challenge`: `ps_at_z` at `verifier.rs:623-640`) and `alpha`; the
    quotient by recomposition from the serialized `quotient_chunks` (`Challenge`); the vanishing and
    its inverse computed from `zeta`.
  * `logupCumSum` IS carried by the proof and IS a `Challenge`:
    `rec.obs_ext(&data.cumulative_sum)` (`apex_shrink_gnark_export.rs:1005`).

So every field-typed slot of both records is a four-lane `Challenge` in deployment, and every one of
them is one BabyBear felt in Lean.

## ⚑ PER-FIELD VERDICT — LOAD-BEARING or INERT, with evidence

**`SingleAirOpening.alpha` — INERT at the apex, and honestly retired here.** The widened single-AIR
record ALREADY EXISTS (`ExtFieldChallenge.ExtSingleAirOpening`) and is ALREADY CONJOINED: the
apex-facing `verifyAlgoUnifiedFaithfulExt` requires
`batchTablesCheckExt extA W params.extDeg ⟨d.constraintAlpha⟩ ⟨d.ζ⟩ view.singleAirOpenings`, which
consumes the COMPLETE four-lane transcript `α` and `ζ`. §9's `faithfulExt_forces_fullWidth_alpha`
proves acceptance forces exactly that. The narrow scalar conjunct
(`singleAirChallengesBound`: `o.alpha = d.constraintAlpha.headD default`) is a redundant
strengthening target retained so `DeployedRefines` transports — it does not carry a soundness claim
the wide conjunct does not already carry. It is nevertheless an unfaithful DESCRIPTION, and §6 says
how unfaithful: `lane0_alpha_does_not_determine_the_fold` exhibits two `Challenge`s agreeing on the
pinned lane whose deployed Horner RLC folds DIFFER.

**`TableOpening.constraintEval` / `vanishingAtZeta` / `quotientAtZeta` (+ `logupCumSum`) —
LOAD-BEARING, and there is NO widened counterpart anywhere in the tree.** `batchTablesCheckExt`
covers `ExtSingleAirOpening` only; nothing carries a widened `TableOpening`. Meanwhile the narrow
identity `topen.constraintEval = A.mul topen.vanishingAtZeta topen.quotientAtZeta` is a HYPOTHESIS of
every extraction bundle that lands `MainAirAcceptF` — `StarkSoundReduce:114/159/193`,
`OodColumnLayout:235`, `ApexOodLaneRepair:257/306/425/691`, `FriDecodedTraceWitness:481`,
`FriLdtExtractDeployed`, `DeployedRefinesProof:105`, `OodSingletonRepair`, `FriFsDecodedOodRepair`.
That is the site this file widens.

## ⚑ THE TRUE RELATION FOUND (investigated, not assumed) — it is the expected shape, sharpened

  * **Base records LIFT, completely** (`wideOfTable_ok_of_tableOk`,
    `wideOfSingleAir_ok_of_singleAirOk`, `wideBusSum_map`, `wideFolded_wideOfSingleAir`,
    `wideRecomposed_wideOfSingleAir`): every tooth — the degree pin, the vanishing recompute, the
    genuine-inverse pin, the Horner RLC, the chunk recomposition, the bus sum — transports along
    `algebraMap BabyBear E`. The widened hypothesis is strictly WEAKER.
  * **The wide record does NOT descend** (`wide_table_beyond_base`): at a `Challenge`-valued OOD
    point there is a widened opening that PASSES, whose recomputed vanishing AND opened quotient are
    both outside `Set.range (algebraMap BabyBear E)` — the lift of no narrow record.
  * **⚑ AND THE NARROW RECORD CANNOT EXPRESS THE DEPLOYED VALUE — sharper than a cardinality
    remark.** `lifted_narrow_forces_base_ood_power`: a LIFTED NARROW record satisfies the widened
    check ONLY at an OOD point whose `2^degreeBits` power lies in the base image. The deployed `ζ` is
    a `Challenge`. So a narrow `TableOpening` that PASSES `tableOk` is passing at a base OOD point —
    a different run from the deployed one, not a coarse view of it. The vanishing recompute is what
    forces this: `Z_H(ζ)` is not a free value, it IS `ζ^{2^db} − 1`.
    This compounds, and explains, the tree's own measurement that `tableOpenings = []` on the only
    exhibited accepting pole (`PremiseInhabitabilitySweep`
    `at_the_only_exhibited_pole_the_repair_is_half_realized`): widening is a PREREQUISITE for that
    conjunct ever being witnessed on a deployed run.
  * **And the lane-0 squeeze cannot rescue the narrow equation**
    (`lane0_square_not_multiplicative`, `lane_product_not_multiplicative`): neither the vanishing
    recompute nor the quotient identity is lane-wise, at any lane of the deployed quartic basis.

## ⚑ THE PAYOFF — weaker-but-achievable hypothesis, IDENTICAL conclusion

`mainAirAcceptF_of_wideTableOpening` and `mainAirAcceptF_of_wideSingleAirOpening`: the widened
record's quotient identity, at an extension `ζ` and an extension batching `α`, still forces the same
BASE-field per-row AIR acceptance `MainAirAcceptF d t`, through the landed
`kprime_compose_of_tableIdentityExt`. `tableOfWideSingleAir_ok` is the bridge: the deployed
acceptance test `folded · inv_vanishing = quotient` plus the genuine-inverse pin FORCES the widened
table identity, at full width.

## ⚑ PRICING — say which, precisely

The lane-0 squeeze has a three-dimensional kernel (`lane0_ker_finrank`); `p^3 > 2^92`
(`squeeze_factor_gt_two_pow_92`, `bb4_card_split`). What that number IS:

  * For `alpha`: **an unfaithful description, NOT a soundness loss.** The deployed `α` is bound at
    full width by the conjunct §9 exhibits; the narrow felt does not weaken any check the deployed
    verifier performs. What it loses is the ability to DENOTE the deployed fold at all.
  * For `TableOpening`: **neither a soundness loss nor a benign relabel — an UNWITNESSABLE
    hypothesis.** Nothing at the apex derives from those three felts (the legacy conjunct passes on
    the default `tableOpenings := []`), so no deployed check is weakened by their narrowness; but
    every soundness chain that CONSUMES them consumes an equation a deployed run does not satisfy.
    `p^3` measures the distance between the described object and the deployed one — it is not an
    attack budget, and nobody should quote it as one.

## WHAT REMAINS NARROW, and why

  * The landed `TableOpening` / `SingleAirOpening` structures and `tableOk` / `singleAirOk` /
    `batchTablesCheck` / `batchTablesCheckUnified` are UNTOUCHED — this file is additive, by the
    coordination rule. Migrating `FriVerifier.BatchProofData.tableOpenings` to the widened record is
    a shared-struct change and is NOT taken here.
  * The extraction bundles listed above still hypothesize the narrow identity, over `ℤ` at `opaque`
    deployed arguments. Retargeting them onto `WideTableOpening` is the follow-on, and it is where
    the `ℤ`-vs-field typing gap has to be crossed as well.
  * `verifyAlgoUnifiedFaithfulExt` takes the narrow `proof` and the wide `view` as two independent
    arguments and asserts NO relation between `proof.singleAirOpenings` and
    `view.singleAirOpenings`. At the deployed apex both are decodes of the same bytes
    (`cfgView` / `cfgExtView`, `CircuitSoundness.lean`), so this is not an exploitable hole — but the
    Lean model does not SAY they agree, and that consistency conjunct is not supplied here either.
  * The FRI soundness floor is unchanged. Widening a record moves no FRI/STARK assumption.

Sorry-free; no `axiom`; no carrier; additive new module; every keystone `#assert_axioms`-checked.

`FriVerifier.tableOk` / `BatchTablesSingleAir.singleAirOk` are stated over an opaque
`FieldArith F` op bundle.  To relate them to anything algebraic the bundle has to be the genuine
field operations; `fieldArithOf` is that instantiation and nothing below reasons about any other
bundle. -/

/-! ## §1 — THE WIDENED RECORDS.

The deployed opened values are `Challenge` — elements of the quartic extension, FOUR ordered
BabyBear lanes (`ExtFieldChallenge.lean:8-15`; `vendor/plonky3-fri-82cfad73/src/verifier.rs:623-640`).
The widened records below carry each opened value as ONE element of an abstract extension `E`;
§2 pins that this is exactly four base lanes at the deployed `BB4`, losslessly, and that the narrow
record carries one.  Typing the value as an `E` rather than as a lane list is what lets the payoff
(§5) reuse the landed extension-typed consumer verbatim; by `deployed_quartic_ext_canonical` the
deployed `BabyBear[X]/(X^4 − 11)` IS `BB4` up to a BabyBear-algebra isomorphism, so nothing depends
on the binomial presentation. -/

/-! ## §3 — THE TRUE RELATION, half one: **the narrow record LIFTS, completely.**

Everything transports along `algebraMap BabyBear E`: the degree pin is a `Nat` equation, and the
vanishing recompute and the quotient identity are ring equations, so a narrow record that PASSES
`tableOk` / `singleAirOk` becomes a wide record that satisfies the widened check at the embedded
OOD point.  The widened hypothesis is therefore strictly WEAKER — retyping loses nothing. -/

/-! ## §4 — THE TRUE RELATION, half two: **the wide record does NOT descend, and the narrow record
cannot EXPRESS the deployed value.**

The vanishing recompute is what makes this sharp and not merely a cardinality remark.  `Z_H(ζ)` is
FORCED to be `ζ^{2^db} − 1`; the OOD point is by construction a `Challenge`, so as soon as
`ζ^{2^db}` is outside the base image, `Z_H(ζ)` is too — and every narrow record's lift has all four
values inside it.  So at a genuinely extension-valued OOD point NO narrow record satisfies the
widened check at all.  It is not that the narrow record is a coarse description of the deployed
one; it describes a value the deployed verifier never holds. -/

/-! ### §4.1 — and the lane-0 squeeze cannot rescue the narrow equation.

`batchTablesCheck` reads `proof.oodPoint`'s HEAD lane and `singleAirChallengesBound` pins
`o.alpha` to `d.constraintAlpha.headD default`.  Both of the narrow record's equations are
MULTIPLICATIVE in the squeezed value, and no basis-coordinate functional of a nontrivial extension
is multiplicative — so the base-typed equation is not the lane-0 image of the deployed one. -/

/-- **The vanishing recompute is not lane-wise.**  There is a `Challenge` whose lane-0 square
differs from the square of its lane 0, so `tableOk`'s `Z_H + 1 = ζ₀^{2^db}` at `degreeBits = 1` is
NOT the lane-0 projection of the deployed `Z_H(ζ) + 1 = ζ^{2}`. Derived from
`coordFunctional_not_multiplicative` by polarization (BabyBear has odd characteristic). -/

/-! ## §5 — THE PAYOFF: the widened record forces the IDENTICAL downstream conclusion.

The whole point of the retyping is that it is not merely more faithful but FREE: the widened
record's quotient identity still lands the base-field per-row AIR acceptance `MainAirAcceptF d t`
through the landed extension-typed composition, so the repair replaces an unachievable hypothesis
(a single felt where the deployed verifier holds a `Challenge`) with an achievable one at the same
conclusion. -/

Two independent facts, and they say DIFFERENT things:

  * the value space collapses by a factor `p^3 > 2^92` (`lane0_ker_finrank`, `bb4_card_split`);
  * and the collapse is not harmless bookkeeping — the RLC fold, which is what the record's `alpha`

    (`lane0_alpha_does_not_determine_the_fold`). -/
