# `Dregg2.Circuit.FriChainStepIdx` — ladder rung L2: the INDEXED per-layer fold chain, and the
chain-far-survival probability bound (the corollary `FriAdversaryObject` deferred), PROVEN.

`FriAdversaryObject` (§3) landed the fold chain at a FIXED word type `C`: `ChainStep far goodSet
fold` (deliberately a `def`, `:172`), `honest_chain_far` (`:196`, the proven easy half), and a
module-header deferral (`:38-47`): the `winProb` corollary was NOT landed because
`FriVerifierCompose`'s import closure was red. The deployed FRI fold is NOT fixed-`C`: it SHRINKS
the domain each round (arity `2^maxLogArity = 8`, `|L_{i+1}| = |L_i|/8`), so the word TYPE and the
radius change per layer — a per-layer SCHEDULE. This file is the generalization plus the priced
corollary, all proven against green-at-HEAD imports:

  * **§1 the hit bound, re-derived.** `hitWin`/`hit_cond`/`hit_bound` are re-derived here verbatim
    from the green `RomCounting` substrate because at authoring time their home,
    `FriVerifierCompose` (`:160/:190/:294`), was UNIMPORTABLE: its closure reached
    `RecursiveSoundFromNodes → AggAirSound → SpongeForgeReduction.lean`, which failed axiom
    hygiene (`forge_floor_top_false_babyBear` depended on `sorryAx` — the unpropagated
    effFloor-regrounding rename). THAT BREAK IS FIXED (2026-07-23, E1): `SpongeForgeReduction` now
    imports `DomainSeparatedCREffRegrounded` and the whole `FriVerifierCompose` closure rebuilds
    green from source, all tripwires passing. ⚠ DUPLICATION DEBT, on purpose and flagged — and now
    ACTIONABLE: the closure is green again, so exactly ONE copy must survive (delete this §1 and
    import, or re-point Compose here). Nothing else here is copied.
  * **§2-§3 the deferred corollary, landed** (`chain_far_survival`): for ANY strategy-shaped
    honest-fold word evolution from a far `w0`, ANY boolean event that implies "the terminal word
    is not far" has `winProb ≤ n·b/|R|` (`n` rounds, `b`-capped bad sets). The proof is exactly
    the shape the deferral named: `fsRun_queryBounded` + `hit_cond` + `honest_chain_far`, glued by
    `hitWin_fsRun_true_iff` (the hit event on the FS tree IS the failure of `AvoidsBad`).
  * **§3, 2026-07-24 — ⚑ THE PROVER IS NOW QUANTIFIED.** Until this landing every survival
    theorem in the tree instantiated `S := honestStrategy fold w0`: the randomness was genuine
    (uniform `H`) but the PROVER was not adversarial, so what was proved was "the HONEST fold
    chain from a far word keeps it far except w.p. `n·b/|R|`". `chain_far_survival_strategy`
    (and its indexed form `chain_far_survival_idx_strategy`, §4) states the SAME bound for an
    ARBITRARY `S : Strategy R C`, gated on the path-local `FoldConsistentAlong`
    (`FriAdversaryObject`) — the branch of the L2 dichotomy the verifier's fold-consistency spot
    checks force. `chain_far_survival_strategy_gated` is the `bad && decide (consistent)` reading.
    The honest statements are now literal INSTANCES (`honest_foldConsistentAlong` discharges the
    gate for free), so nothing is lost; §6.1 fires the generalized bound at a prover PROVEN not
    equal to the honest one (`offpathS_ne_honest`, bound `7/|BabyBear|`), so nothing is
    disguised. **§3.1 is the canary**: `consistencyFreeSurvival_false` REFUTES the same statement
    with the gate deleted — a prover that COMMITS A CODEWORD at round 1 escapes farness with
    probability exactly 1 (`codewordCommit_escape_prob_one`) against an identity fold and empty
    bad sets, i.e. against a claimed bound of 0. What is still NOT proved anywhere in-tree is the
    other branch (that a fold-INCONSISTENT prover is caught by the query phase); that is the
    query-phase dichotomy, priced separately and not by this file.
    ⚑ One hypothesis is DELIBERATELY different from the landed `honest_chain_far`: the cover is
    FAR-CONDITIONAL (`far w → goodSet w ⊆ E (enc w cs)`), proven sufficient by
    `honest_chain_far_of_farCover`. The unconditional cover the landed theorem demands is
    UNINSTANTIABLE at the deployed RS shape — a MEMBER word's good set is ALL of `F`
    (`fold_complete`), so any unconditional cover forces `b ≥ |F|` and the bound degenerates to
    `≥ n`. That refutation is PROVEN in §7 (`unconditional_cover_trivial_at_deployed`), not prose.
  * **§4 the INDEXED chain** (`ChainStepIdx`): per-layer word types `W i`, per-layer radius
    schedule `far i`, per-layer good sets, `fold i : W i → R → W (i+1)`. The reduction to the
    landed machinery is a THEOREM, not a re-proof: `chainStepIdx_iff_sigma` packages the layer
    index into `Σ i, W i` and is exactly `ChainStep` there; `honest_sig_layer`/`terminal_layer`
    pin the honest evolution to layer = round count. `chain_far_survival_idx` is the composed
    survival bound over the schedule.
  * **§5 the distance-graded cap** (`goodδ_card_lt`, NEW over `FriFoldArity`): a word that is not
    `n²·d`-close to `C` has FEWER THAN `n` challenges folding it `d`-close to `C'` — the
    contrapositive of `fold_close_of_arity_challenges` in cardinality form, generalizing
    `good_challenge_card_lt` (its `d = 0` case). This is the per-layer `b` a real schedule
    consumes; it is a PROVEN cap, which is what separates a legitimate by-definition `goodδ` from
    the vacuity trap (§7).
  * **§6 the instance FIRES**: at the deployed-arity BabyBear setup `friSetupK8` (arity 8,
    `|L| = 16 → |κ| = 2`), a genuine `ChainStepIdx` instance (far word `f0`, cap `b = 7` from
    `goodδ_card_lt`) runs through `chain_far_survival_idx` end-to-end:
    `Pr[the FS-derived challenge folds the far f0 INTO the code] ≤ 7/|BabyBear|` — and the bound
    is genuinely `< 1` (`k8_bound_lt_one`), unlike anything the vacuous route can produce.
  * **§7 the falsifiers** (the acceptance bar: refute the un-generalized / vacuous forms):
      - `fixed_radius_collapse_refuted` — a family where `ChainStepIdx` HOLDS but collapsing the
        schedule to one layer's radius is FALSE at the first fold: the schedule is load-bearing.
      - `goodSet_by_definition_is_free` + `goodSet_by_definition_no_content` — THE VACUITY TRAP,
        exhibited and priced: defining `goodSet w := {r | ¬ far (fold w r)}` makes `ChainStep`
        true for EVERY fold (zero content), and at a farness-destroying fold that set is ALL of
        `R`, so the survival hypotheses force `b ≥ |R|` and the "bound" is `≥ 1`. A by-definition
        good set is admissible ONLY with an externally-PROVEN cap (§5); it can never supply one.
      - `unconditional_cover_trivial_at_deployed` — the landed fixed-`C` `honest_chain_far`'s
        unconditional-cover hypothesis forces `b ≥ |BabyBear|` at the deployed shape (via
        `fHon8_goodδ_univ`): the un-generalized form yields NO nontrivial deployed bound.

## ⚑ Reported precisely: what the tree does NOT yet provide for the DEPLOYED multi-layer schedule

  * **~~No welded setup TOWER~~ — STALE as of 2026-07-25: `Dregg2/Circuit/FriSetupTower.lean` LANDED it**
    (five welded arity-8 layers at the `2^19` production domain, `tower_link` proving
    `(towerS i).C' = (towerS (i+1)).C` across the real schedule, `chainStepIdx_tower`). What remains is
    NOT the tower but its RADIUS: every landed schedule runs at `d = 0`, so the margin in
    `goodδ_card_lt` is zero and `ChainStepGap` has no positive-radius instance. Original text follows.
  * **No welded setup TOWER.** A deployed `L`-layer instance of `ChainStepIdx` needs a family
    `S : Fin L → FriSetupK` with `(S i).C' = (S (i+1)).C` (the folded code of layer `i` IS the
    domain code of layer `i+1`, transported along `κ_i ≃ ι_{i+1}`). `FriFoldArity` provides ONE
    setup (`friSetupK8`, `|ι| = 16, |κ| = 2`) and its §4 instance cannot even take a second
    arity-8 step (`|κ| = 2 < 8`). §6 therefore fires at ONE layer; the multi-layer firing waits
    on the tower (and on realistic domain sizes — cf. `FriPositiveRadiusPayment`'s finding that
    `friSetupK8`'s positive-radius farness is uninhabited at `|L| = 16`).
  * **No vocabulary weld to the ledger.** `FriLedgerSound.ledger_perFold_soundness`'s `goodCount`
    cap lives in the `Φ`/`H`-polynomial vocabulary (`good_card_le_of_phase_injective`), not the
    `FriSetupK`/`closeN` vocabulary `goodδ_card_lt` lives in; identifying the two good sets (so
    the per-layer `b` can be read off the exported ledger) is real work not done here or anywhere
    in-tree. The per-layer `b` this file consumes is `goodδ_card_lt`'s `n − 1`.
  * `hit_cond` prices a UNIFORM per-point cap `b`; a per-layer `Σ bᵢ` refinement would need a
    schedule-indexed hit bound (same induction, indexed budget) — not needed while `b = n − 1`
    is layer-uniform at fixed arity.

non-hit, costs zero); a fresh query splits on its answer (`condProb_split`), at most `b` of the

`goodSet w ⊆ E (enc w cs)` is demanded only at FAR `w`. Same induction (the chain only ever
stands on far words). This weakening is NOT cosmetic: §7's
`unconditional_cover_trivial_at_deployed` proves the unconditional form forces `b ≥ |F|` at the
deployed RS shape (a MEMBER word's good set is everything), i.e. the landed hypothesis shape
admits no nontrivial deployed bound.

/-- **⚑⚑ CHAIN-FAR SURVIVAL AT AN ARBITRARY PROVER STRATEGY, PRICED.** The deepest probabilistic
object of the FRI ladder, no longer restricted to the honest prover. `S : Strategy R C` is ANY
adaptive strategy (challenge history ↦ next commitment); the only thing asked of it is the
PATH-LOCAL `FoldConsistentAlong` (each round's commitment is the fold of the previous one along
the path the oracle walks — what the verifier's fold-consistency spot checks force, on pain of
being caught). Then any boolean event implying "`S` was fold-consistent along the path AND the
terminal commitment is NOT far" has probability at most `n·b/|R|`.

Same recipe as before — `fsRun_queryBounded` + `hit_bound` + `chain_far_strategy_of_farCover`,
glued by `hitWin_fsRun_true_iff` — but the randomness is now genuinely quantified over a prover
STRATEGY rather than over the honest fold of a fixed `w0`. `chain_far_survival` is the honest
instance (nothing lost); `consistencyFreeSurvival_false` (§3.1) shows the gate cannot be dropped;
`k8_chain_far_survival_offpath` (§6) fires it at the deployed arity-8 shape with a strategy
PROVEN not equal to `honestStrategy`. -/

/-- **⚑ CHAIN-FAR SURVIVAL, PRICED** — the corollary `FriAdversaryObject:38-47` deferred. Under a
`ChainStep` instance with `b`-capped, far-conditionally-covered bad sets, ANY boolean event that
implies "the terminal word of the `n`-round honest-fold FS chain from the far `w0` is NOT far"
has probability at most `n·b/|R|` over the random oracle. Proof = the deferral's recipe:
`fsRun_queryBounded` (the FS chain is an `n`-query tree) + `hit_cond`/`hit_bound` (the hit event
is priced) + `honest_chain_far_of_farCover` (no hit ⟹ far survives), glued by
`hitWin_fsRun_true_iff`. Stated against an abstract `bad` so no decidability of `far` is needed;
`chain_far_survival_prob` reads it as the direct event.

the fold-consistency gate discharges to nothing because `honest_foldConsistentAlong` holds

/-! ## §3.1 — ⚑ THE CANARY: without fold-consistency the strategy-generic bound is FALSE.

The whole content of the generalization is that the gate `FoldConsistentAlong` is the ONLY thing
`chain_far_survival_strategy` asks of an arbitrary prover — so it had better be load-bearing.
It is, and this is the witness: a prover that simply COMMITS A CODEWORD at round 1 escapes
farness with probability EXACTLY 1, against a fold that preserves farness perfectly (the
identity) and EMPTY bad sets (`b = 0`, so the claimed bound is `0`). Every other hypothesis of
`chain_far_survival` — `ChainStep`, the cap, the cover, initial farness — is satisfied. The
strategy is excluded by exactly one thing: it is fold-INCONSISTENT at round 1
(`codewordCommit_not_foldConsistent`). -/

`k8_chain_far_survival` fires the honest instance. The generalization is only worth something if
it also fires at a strategy the honest one cannot express — otherwise `FoldConsistentAlong`
would just be a disguised way of saying "S = honestStrategy". It is not: fold-consistency is
PATH-LOCAL, so a prover is free to behave arbitrarily off the walked path. -/

/-- **A NON-HONEST, path-consistent prover at the deployed arity-8 shape.** On prefixes of length
≤ 1 — the entire 1-round FS path — it commits what the honest fold commits; on longer prefixes,
where the honest prover would sit at layer ≥ 2, it commits the layer-0 word again. Nothing in
`Strategy` forbids that, and nothing in `FoldConsistentAlong` at `n = 1` sees it. -/

/-- **FALSIFIER — the fixed-radius collapse is FALSE.** Take the staircase family (where
`ChainStepIdx` HOLDS, `stair_chainStepIdx`) and collapse the schedule to layer 0's radius for
every layer — the un-generalized fixed-`C` reading, one `far` for all rounds. The very first fold
refutes it: `far 0` holds, the good set is empty, and the folded word fails `far`. The per-layer
schedule is LOAD-BEARING; the deployed shrinking-domain fold cannot be priced by reusing one
layer's radius. (What survives of the fixed-`C` machinery is the `Σ i, W i` packaging —
`chainStepIdx_iff_sigma` — where the "radius" internalizes the layer.) -/

/-- **THE VACUITY TRAP, exhibited.** Define the good set to be WHATEVER makes the step true —
`goodSet w := {r | ¬ far (fold w r)}` — and `ChainStep` holds for EVERY `far` and EVERY `fold`,
including folds that destroy farness outright. A `ChainStep` obtained this way carries ZERO
per-fold content; `goodSet_by_definition_no_content` prices the consequence. -/

`(E, b)` satisfying `chain_far_survival`'s cover + cap hypotheses (even only far-conditionally)
is forced to `b ≥ |R|`, so for every `n ≥ 1` the "bound" `n·b/|R|` is `≥ 1` — trivially true of
any probability. A goodSet defined to make the theorem true can never beat the trivial bound; the
content of a survival bound is exactly an EXTERNALLY-PROVEN cap (`goodδ_card_lt`, whose §6
instance yields `7/|BabyBear| < 1`, `k8_bound_lt_one`). -/
