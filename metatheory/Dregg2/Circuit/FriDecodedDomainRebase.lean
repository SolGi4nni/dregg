# `Dregg2.Circuit.FriDecodedDomainRebase` — L5·R4b SUB-PIECE 3: the ω₂₇-vs-ω₂₄ domain re-base.

## The mismatch, as VERIFIED in the files (not as described)

Two layers index the SAME trace rows at DIFFERENT field elements:

  * the OOD/constraint modeler puts trace row `i` at `ω₂₇^i`
    (`TraceColumnInterp.rowPt`, `TraceColumnInterp.lean:37`; `domainSize = 2^27`);
  * the FRI decode readout puts trace row `i` at `ω₂₄^(8·i)`
    (`FriDecodedTraceReadout.rowPt`, `FriDecodedTraceReadout.lean:115`), and
    `ω₂₄ = ω₂₇^8` (`FriDeployedRateInstance.lean:412`).

So the decode's row `i` is `ω₂₇^(64·i)` — CONFIRMED, the prompt's arithmetic is right. The two
are genuinely different points (`decodePt_ne_interpPt_one`), and modeler row 1 is not ANY decode
row (`interpPt_one_ne_decodePt`); the indexings overlap on exactly the rows `64 ∣ i`
(`interpPt_mem_decodeRange_iff`), i.e. `2^15` of the `2^21` modeler rows.

## The reconciliation (this file)

**It reconciles.** The stride is `64` and `64 · 2^21 = 2^27` EXACTLY: the decode's trace
subdomain is the stride-`64` sub-family of the modeler's committed `2^27` domain
(`decodePt_eq_interpPt` — an index identity, no approximation), and the substitution that moves
between them is `X ↦ X^64` (`rebase`), with the degree budget inflating by exactly the stride and
still fitting the modeler's domain with zero slack (`rebase64_natDegree_lt`).

## Scope — what is proven, and what is NOT

PROVEN (no `sorry`, no axiom beyond the three kernel ones; `#assert_axioms` on 39 declarations):
  1. §1 — both indexings pinned as explicit functions of the row index (`interpPt`, `decodePt`,
     each equal to its file's `rowPt` by `rfl`), the exponent identity `decodePt i = interpPt
     (64·i)`, `64 · 2^21 = 2^27 = domainSize` (zero slack), injectivity of each family on the
     trace-row range, injectivity of the re-indexing `i ↦ 64·i` (a genuine re-index, not a
     collapse), the exact overlap, and the differing row-SHIFT multipliers `ω₂₇` vs `ω₂₇^64`
     (which is what any transition/`nextShift` reasoning turns on).
  2. §2 — the change of variable: `(p(X^64)).eval (ω₂₇^i) = p.eval (ω₂₄^(8i))`, exact and
     hypothesis-free (`rebase_eval_basePt` generic, `rebase64_eval_interpPt` deployed), the
     degree transport `natDegree p < 2^21 ⟹ natDegree p(X^64) < 2^27` (`rebase64_natDegree_lt` —
     a low-degree witness for one indexing IS one for the other), and re-base faithfulness on the
     decode's low-degree witnesses (`rebase64_inj_lowDegree`).
  3. §3 — the EXACT alternative (`interpolate_stridePt_eq_self`, deployed instance
     `interpolate_decodePt_eq_self`): re-basing the modeler's NODE FAMILY to stride `64` makes the
     two layers' column polynomials literally EQUAL — no substitution, no remainder. The modeler's
     development uses `rowPt` only through injectivity on the row range, which the decode's family
     also has, so this is a live definition change for `TraceColumnInterp.rowPt`, not a wish.
  4. §4 — the CONSUMER direction (decode ⟶ modeler, the direction `DecodedLdtLink` needs, since
     the link is phrased in modeler objects and sub-piece 2 produces decode-side facts): for the
     decoded `VmTrace`, the modeler's `colPoly` agrees with the re-based decode interpolant at
     every row (`colPoly_decodedVmTrace_eval`) and IS the Lagrange interpolant of it on the
     modeler's node family (`colPoly_decodedVmTrace_eq_interpolate`), pinned as the unique
     `natDegree < 2^21` such polynomial (`colPoly_decodedVmTrace_pinned`).
  5. §5 — the discrepancy off the rows, exactly: the difference vanishes on all `2^21` rows and is
     therefore divisible by the row-vanishing polynomial `Z = ∏_{i<2^21}(X − ω₂₇^i)`
     (`rowVanishing_dvd_of_rows_zero`, `rebase64_sub_colPoly_isRoot`), giving
     `p(ζ^64) = colPoly(ζ) + Z(ζ)·h(ζ)` at any `ζ` (`eval_correspondence_of_factor`); and the
     discrepancy is NOT vacuous — for `natDegree p ≥ 2^15` the two are different polynomials
     (`rebase64_ne_colPoly`).
  6. §6 — the same bridge at the actual R4b extraction object `decodedTr`
     (`decodedTr_colPoly_rebase`), which is what `DecodedLdtLink` (`FriDecodedTraceWitness:450`)
     names.
  7. §7 — FIRED on a concrete instance: `ZMod 17`, `ω = 3` of order `16`, stride `4` (so the
     stride root is `13`, of order `4`, and `4·4 = 16` fills the domain as `64·2^21 = 2^27` does),
     decode polynomial `X² + 1`. The two indexings give DIFFERENT points at row 1 (`3` vs `13`)
     and the re-base makes them read the SAME computed values (`0` at row 1, `2` at row 2); the
     exact re-base returns `X² + 1` on the nose.

NOT PROVEN / HONEST LIMITS:
  * This file does NOT close `DecodedLdtLink`. It closes only its named sub-piece 3 (the domain
    re-base). Sub-pieces 1 (the DEEP-quotient RLC input model) and 2 (correlated-agreement
    quotient consistency) are untouched and remain the wall.
  * With the CURRENT `TraceColumnInterp.rowPt`, `colPoly` and `p(X^64)` agree on the `2^21` trace
    rows and NOT as polynomials (§5). So an OOD claim about `p_j(ζ)` transports to the modeler's
    `colPoly` at `ζ` only up to `Z(ζ)·h(ζ)`. Sub-piece 2 must either take its OOD point in the
    decode's coordinate (`ζ ↦ ζ^64`) or adopt §3's stride-`64` node family, which removes the
    correction entirely. That is a REAL constraint on how sub-pieces 2 and 3 compose.
  * §5's two halves are deliberately NOT composed into one deployed `∃h ∀ζ` theorem: putting
    `Lagrange.nodal (Finset.range (2^21)) interpPt` into that position makes the KERNEL's defeq
    check expand the `2^21`-fold product and diverge (measured: >150 s, `deterministic timeout`).
    Composition at the use site is one line and checks fine. The same hazard is why `colPoly` of
    `decodedVmTrace` is reached through `colPoly_eq_interpolate_envAt` (a general-`t` `rfl`) and
    never by a `rfl` at the decoded trace, which would force `List.ofFn` over `Fin (2^21)`.

/-! ## §5 — THE HONEST LIMIT: exact ON THE ROWS, and a `Z`-multiple off them.

With the CURRENT `TraceColumnInterp.rowPt`, the re-base is exact on the `2^21` trace rows and NOT
as a polynomial identity: `p(X^64)` has degree up to `64·(2^21−1)` while `colPoly` has degree
`< 2^21`. Their difference is divisible by the row-vanishing (nodal) polynomial `Z`, and is
NONZERO whenever `2^15 ≤ natDegree p`. So an OOD claim about `p_j(ζ)` transports to the modeler's
`colPoly` at `ζ` only up to `Z(ζ)` — this is a real constraint on how sub-piece 2 composes with
sub-piece 3, not a formality. §3's node-family change removes it entirely. -/

`rowVanishing_dvd_of_rows_zero` supplies for `q := colPoly` of the decoded trace, via

`p(ζ^64) = q(ζ) + Z(ζ)·h(ζ)`. Off the trace subdomain `Z(ζ) ≠ 0`, so this correction term is
exactly what sub-piece 2 must carry — or eliminate by adopting §3's node-family change.

(The two halves are kept separate on purpose: composing them into one deployed statement puts
`Lagrange.nodal (Finset.range (2^21)) interpPt` into a position where the KERNEL's defeq check
expands the `2^21`-fold product and does not terminate. Composition at the use site — supply the
`Z·h` factorisation, then apply this — is one line and checks fine.) -/
