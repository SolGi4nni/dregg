# `Dregg2.Circuit.FriDecodedTraceWitness` — L5·R4b: from R4a's decoded trace matrix to the
`TraceWitnessed` legs — the AIR-satisfaction half, assembled on the LANDED ALI/quotient chain,
with the DEEP linkage named as the precise residual.

## The R4b ASSESS verdict (the load-bearing question, answered first)

**Q: does "the verifier ACCEPTS" + "the decoded trace is the low-degree word" discharge the
AIR-constraint leg (`MainAirAcceptF`)?** The answer splits the DEEP-ALI argument into its two
classical halves, and they have OPPOSITE status in this tree:

  * **The ALI/quotient half is LANDED** (accept ⟹ the constraints hold on the trace, GIVEN the
    opened-values↔trace-polynomials link): `verifyAlgo_accept_forces_table_identity`
    (`OodQuotientConsistency.lean:197` — acceptance FORCES the batched OOD identity, a theorem),
    `commitmentOpening_binds_of_poseidon2CR` (`OodCommitmentBinding` — opened = committed under
    the `Poseidon2SpongeCR` floor), `rlc_debatch` (`OodSoundnessGame` — Schwartz–Zippel
    de-batching at a non-exceptional Λ), `hood_of_oodColumnLayout` (`OodColumnLayout.lean:218` —
    the ∀-descriptor composition of the three), and
    `ood_forces_mainAirAccept_field_of_residuals` (`FieldIntegerLift.lean:139` —
    `{hood, hnonexc} ⟹ MainAirAcceptF`, with the `hZrow`/`hCrow` axes discharged in-tree).
    Composed descriptor-polymorphically at `AlgoStarkSoundTransferV3.mainAirAcceptF_of_floor`
    and `AlgoStarkSoundGeneral.algoStarkSound_of_memoryLegs`. This file USES that chain — the
    AIR leg below is DERIVED, never assumed.

  * **The DEEP half is a GENUINE GAP** (the opened OOD values are consistent with the COMMITTED
    — now DECODED — columns). Every landed composition Skolemizes the trace
    (`FriLdtExtract`'s `tr` field, `AlgoStarkSoundGeneral.lean:134`) and carries the
    column-layout equation `hlayout` as a hypothesis about that free trace. Nothing ties the
    opened `constraintEval`/`vanishingAtZeta`/`quotientAtZeta` to the unique interpolants R4a
    decodes out of the commitment. THE MISSING THEOREM (the knowledge-soundness core):

      for an accepting run whose committed matrix `M` is `ColsClose`-close, with `T` the unique
      decoded trace (`FriDecodedTraceReadout.colsClose_unique_trace`) and `p_j` the per-column
      interpolants, the verifier's opened OOD data satisfies
      `(oodBatchResidual d (decodedVmTrace T …) ζ qp).eval Λ
         = cast vCommitted − cast (A.mul vanishingAtZeta quotientAtZeta)`
      (+ the ε-form non-exceptionality of ζ/Λ as the honest probabilistic remainder).

    What closes it, precisely, in three sub-pieces:
      1. a Lean model of the deployed DEEP quotient — the FRI input word IS the α-RLC of the
         per-column quotients `(p_j(X) − opened_j)/(X − ζ)` over the opened rows
         (`fri/src/verifier.rs:620-640` at rev `82cfad7`); this seam is deliberately unmodeled
         (`DeployedTraceExtract.lean:414-419` names it as the RLC input-reduction residual);
      2. the quotient-consistency step — DEEP-quotient word inside the decoding radius ⟹ every
         claimed OOD value equals `p_j(ζ)` (factor theorem + unique decoding), distributed from
         the RLC batch to the individual columns by BCIKS correlated agreement — the primitive
         is NAMED (`FriCorrelatedAgreementSharp.CorrelatedAgreementLine`, with the reduction
         proven at the wrap instance) but UNPROVEN, and no deployed-instance wire exists;
      3. the domain re-base — the OOD modeler interpolates trace row `i` at `ω₂₇^i`
         (`TraceColumnInterp.lean:34-37`, `domainSize = 2^27`) while the deployed decode reads
         row `i` at `ω₂₄^(8·i)` (`FriDecodedTraceReadout.rowPt`); `constraintPoly` of the
         decoded trace must be tied to the decoded ω₂₄-interpolants across that model change.

    This is the honest wall of L5/R4b — research-grade proof engineering (2 is the core; 1 and
    3 are heavy modeling), NOT dischargeable from the landed machinery. It is carried below as
    `DecodedLdtLink` — the FriLdtExtract payload AT THE DECODED TRACE, minus what the
    identification discharges — never as `MainAirAcceptF`, never as `hood`.

## What this file BUILDS (all sorry-free, no axiom, no carrier)

  1. **The field-vector→`VmTrace` identification** (§1): `decodedVmTrace` — a decoded matrix as
     a deployed `VmTrace` (canonical ℤ-lifts of the BabyBear entries), generic in the row count
     `n` and instantiated at the deployed `2^21`, with the readout equations,
     `rows.length = 2^21 ≤ domainSize` (the `hcap` conjunct of the landed bundles, now a
     THEOREM), and FAITHFULNESS (`decodedVmTrace_faithful` — the identification loses nothing,
     mirroring R4a's `trace_pins_codeword`).
  2. **The decode as a FUNCTION** (§2): `decodedMatrix` — R4a's `∃!` turned into
     extraction-as-data, with its defining property, uniqueness, and the composed `∃!` at the
     `VmTrace` (`colsClose_unique_vmTrace`). FIRE on R4a's concrete fixtures: the corrupted
     `fireWord24` commitment decodes to the all-ones trace, whose `VmTrace` rows READ `1`.
  3. **The L5 assembly at the REALISTIC deployed instance** (§4):
     `positiveRadiusTraceDecode_decoded` — `PositiveRadiusTraceDecode … friSetupDeployed
     oracle 7340032` (the `2^24`-point, rate-`1/8` instance of `FriDeployedRateInstance`, NOT
     the size-16 toy `friSetupK8`; radius = the true UD radius R4a inherits from R2). Its
     residuals are EXACTLY {`Poseidon2SpongeCR`, `DecodedLdtLink`, `DecodedBusLink`} + the
     graduated-shape facts; per accepting close run, `MainAirAcceptF` is DERIVED by the landed
     ALI chain, the sites/ranges/memory legs (7 of the 11 `TraceWitnessed` legs) are DISCHARGED
     structurally, and the non-arith arm is derived from the bus models.

  |                                        |  same posture as the committed `FriLdtExtractV3`)   |

  Honest scope notes: the mem/map discharge is for GRADUATED (all-lookup non-arith, mem/map-free)
  descriptors — the deployed `transferV3` class (`positiveRadiusTraceDecode_transferV3`);
  descriptors with real memory ops owe their memory legs exactly as
  `AlgoStarkSoundGeneral.MemoryLegs` states them. `pub`/aux-`tf` remain extractor-supplied data:
  R4b pins the MAIN-TRACE ROWS to the commitment's decode; the aux-table columns' own decode is a
  further rung (their soundness enters through `BusModelOk`, which is carried, not faked).

No sorry, no axiom, `#assert_axioms` on every theorem.

⚑ NO LONGER PURELY ADDITIVE (2026-07-25): `decodedLdtLink_of_friLdtExtract` was DELETED from this
file. It was the only route into the DEEP-ALI residual `DecodedLdtLink`, and its hypothesis —
`AlgoStarkSoundGeneral.FriLdtExtract` — is PROVED to force `CircuitSoundness.verifyBatch` to reject
EVERY input at the deployed `cfg*` arguments, i.e. it was an EMPTY premise. See the deletion note at
the `DecodedLdtLink` definition below; the replacement is
`FriFsDecodedOodRepair.decodedLdtLinkCons_of_friLdtExtractCons`, landing in `DecodedLdtLinkCons`.
⚠ `DecodedLdtLink` itself (retained here) still states the SINGLETON `oodPoint = [ood]` and is
therefore still refuted on accepting runs — it is kept as the subject of
`FriFsDecodedOodRepair.decodedLdtLink_makes_verifyBatch_reject_every_close_run`, not as a premise
anything should newly consume.

/-! ## §1 — The field-vector→`VmTrace` identification.

A decoded trace matrix (R4a's readout: rows = the trace rows, columns = the committed trace
columns) becomes a deployed `VmTrace` by taking the CANONICAL integer lift of each BabyBear
entry (`ZMod.val` — the unique representative in `[0, p)`; the lift is canonical, so the
identification is lossless, not a many-one collapse). Everything here is generic in the row
count `n`; the deployed instantiation is `n := 2^21` (R4a's trace subdomain). `pub` and the
aux-table family remain extractor data (see the header's honest-scope note). -/

`decodedTr` totalizes the decode (the default off the close branch is never reached by the
assembly — `PositiveRadiusTraceDecode` supplies `ColsClose` per run). The residual `Prop`s are
the `FriLdtExtract` payload AT `decodedTr` — the trace is NO LONGER Skolemized: what remains
hypothetical is exactly the DEEP linkage (header, "the missing theorem"), the ε-form FS
non-exceptionality, the bus models, and the published-commit deployment fact. The `hcap`
conjunct is GONE — discharged by `decodedVmTrace_hcap`/`decodedTr_rows_le`. -/

/-! **⚑ DELETED 2026-07-25 — `decodedLdtLink_of_friLdtExtract`.** It supplied `DecodedLdtLink` from
`AlgoStarkSoundGeneral.FriLdtExtract` at `decodedTr`. That bundle is PROVED to force
`CircuitSoundness.verifyBatch` to reject EVERY input at the deployed `cfg*` arguments
(`ApexOodLaneRepair.friLdtExtract_makes_verifyBatch_reject_everything`), so the adapter's hypothesis
was an EMPTY premise and it was the only route into the DEEP-ALI residual. Its replacement is
`FriFsDecodedOodRepair.decodedLdtLinkCons_of_friLdtExtractCons`, which lands directly in
`DecodedLdtLinkCons` (the `ood :: oodRest` shape `FriVerifier.batchTablesCheck` matches at
`FriVerifier.lean:805`) from `ApexOodLaneRepair.FriLdtExtractCons`. No twin is kept: routing the
old adapter through `decodedLdtLink_imp_cons` would have preserved the empty ENTRY — and that
transport is itself DELETED as of 2026-07-30, when `DecodedLdtLinkCons` gained the per-run opening
residual the landed link never carried. -/

/-! ## §4 — ⚑ THE L5 ASSEMBLY: `PositiveRadiusTraceDecode` at the REALISTIC deployed instance.

`friSetupDeployed` (`FriDeployedRateInstance.lean:454`): `|ι| = 2^24`, rate `1/8`, arity `8` —
the realistic-domain instance, NOT the size-16 toy `friSetupK8` the §3′ structure fields were
pinned at. Radius `7340032` = the true unique-decoding radius (R2/R4a, sharp both polarities).
HONEST caveat: this is the single-fold-resolution instance — the multi-LAYER fold tower of the
deployed FRI (and the intermediate layers' membership moving into the probabilistic assembly)
remains L5/L6 engineering beyond this rung, as `DeployedTraceExtract` §3′ already names. -/

/-! ## §4.1 — ⚑ DELETED 2026-07-25: `positiveRadiusTraceDecode_decoded` / `…_transferV3`.

They assembled `PositiveRadiusTraceDecode` from the LANDED `DecodedLdtLink` — the residual whose
singleton OOD conclusion is PROVED to force `CircuitSoundness.verifyBatch` to reject EVERY
`ColsClose`-close run at the deployed `cfg*` arguments
(`FriFsDecodedOodRepair.decodedLdtLink_makes_verifyBatch_reject_every_close_run`), i.e. they
delivered `TraceWitnessed` only on runs the deployed verifier rejects — and, independently, from a
BASE-typed challenge (`ζ Λ : BabyBear`) where the deployed `ζ`/`Λ` are quartic-extension elements
(`ExtFieldChallenge.lean:8-15`), which is not a restriction of the deployed equation but a different
equation over a strictly smaller value space (`OodExtChallengeLayout.extLayout_value_beyond_base`,
fired at `transferV3`).

They are SUPERSEDED, exactly and without loss, by the single chain in `FriFsDecodedOodRepair`:

* `positiveRadiusTraceDecode_decoded_extChallenges` / `…_transferV3_extChallenges` — the assembly
  with BOTH challenge families at the deployed typing (`DecodedLdtLinkExtCons BB4` +
  `DecodedBusLinkExt`), same conclusion at the same `friSetupDeployed`/UD-radius-`7340032` instance;
* `positiveRadiusTraceDecode_decoded_extCons` — the OOD half alone;
* `positiveRadiusTraceDecode_decoded_cons` — the base-typed link, now a COROLLARY of the above via
  `decodedLdtLinkExtCons_of_decodedLdtLinkCons`.

⚑ 2026-07-30: the line that stood here — "anyone holding the landed `DecodedLdtLink` recovers the
deleted statements verbatim as `positiveRadiusTraceDecode_decoded_cons … (decodedLdtLink_imp_cons …
h)`" — is FALSE now and is corrected rather than left. `decodedLdtLink_imp_cons` is DELETED:
`DecodedLdtLinkCons` gained the PER-RUN opening residual `¬ OpeningColl` (the honest replacement for
the refuted `Poseidon2SpongeCR` the assembly used to thread) and the landed link never carried it.
Holding the landed link recovers nothing, which costs nothing, because that link is one this tree
PROVES makes `verifyBatch` reject every close run at the deployed arguments. The statements are
deleted rather than kept because a twin of a statement that is provably about nothing at deployment
is exactly what this campaign is removing. -/

/-- **The assembled conclusion BITES** — `TraceWitnessed`'s AIR leg is falsifiable: the
