# `Dregg2.Circuit.FriDeepQuotientRlc` — L5·R4b sub-piece 1: the DEPLOYED DEEP-quotient α-RLC
input reduction, MODELED.

## What this file is

`FriDecodedTraceWitness.lean:450` (`DecodedLdtLink`) names three sub-pieces that close the DEEP-ALI
residual. Sub-piece 1 is "a Lean model of the deployed DEEP quotient — the FRI input word IS the
α-RLC of the per-column quotients". `FriBatchedOracle.lean:50-57` and
`DeployedTraceExtract.lean:414-419` both name that reduction as DELIBERATELY unmodeled. This file
models it.

## The deployed object (verbatim, rev `82cfad73`, `fri/src/verifier.rs:617-640`)

```rust
let (alpha_pow, ro) = reduced_openings.entry(log_height).or_insert((Challenge::ONE, Challenge::ZERO));
for (point, (z, ps_at_z)) in mat_points_and_values.iter().enumerate() {
    let quotient = (*z - x).inverse();
    for (&p_at_x, &p_at_z) in mat_opening.iter().zip(ps_at_z.iter()) {
        *ro += *alpha_pow * (p_at_z - p_at_x) * quotient;
        *alpha_pow *= alpha;
    }
}
```

so the FRI input word at domain point `x` is `ro(x) = Σ_j α^j · (p_j(z) − p_j(x)) · (z − x)⁻¹`.

**TYPES (checked in the source, not assumed).** `x : Val` (`= Val::GENERATOR *
two_adic_generator(log_height)^rev_index`, `:614-615`) is BASE field; `p_at_x : Val` (an element of
`mat_opening`, the Merkle-opened row) is BASE field; `z`, `p_at_z`, `alpha`, `alpha_pow`, `ro`,
`quotient` are all `Challenge` — the DEGREE-4 EXTENSION. So the committed base-field value becomes
extension-valued at the SUBTRACTION `p_at_z - p_at_x`, i.e. BEFORE any challenge multiplies it, and
the FRI input word is an EXTENSION-valued word over a BASE-field evaluation domain. This file is
therefore typed over `[Field F] [Field E] [Algebra F E]` with the committed matrix over `F` and the
reduced word over `E`; `E := F` (the trivial algebra) recovers the in-tree single-field shape.

## What is PROVEN here (no `sorry`, no `axiom`, no vacuous statement)

* §0 **the imperative loop IS the closed form** — `reduceOpening_eq`: the deployed mutable
  `(alpha_pow, ro)` fold over the opened row equals `(α^len, Σ_i α^i · tᵢ)`. The model is the
  deployed loop, not a formula that resembles it.
* §1 **the factor theorem, deployed-side** — `deepQuot p z := p /ₘ (X − C z)` is a genuine
  polynomial with `p = C (p.eval z) + (X − C z) · deepQuot p z`, `natDegree` DROPS by one
  (`deepQuot_natDegree_lt`: `natDegree p < k`, `2 ≤ k` ⟹ `natDegree (deepQuot p z) < k − 1`), and
  its evaluation at any `x ≠ z` is EXACTLY the deployed division
  (`deepQuot_eval_deployed`: `= (p.eval z − p.eval x) * (z − x)⁻¹`). This is what makes the deployed
  `.inverse()` well-defined as a low-degree object.
* §2 **the RLC** — `rlcQuotPoly`, degree `< k − 1`, and `friInputWord_eq_evalVec`: when every
  committed column IS a codeword and the claimed OOD values are the honest ones, the deployed input
  word IS `evalVec` of a single `natDegree < k − 1` polynomial — so it is a CODEWORD of the
  degree-`< k−1` RS code on the (embedded) domain (`friInputWord_mem_rsCode`).
* §3 **the perturbation bound** — `friInputWord_closeN`: if every column is only `d`-CLOSE to its
  codeword (the `ColsClose` input the deployed decode actually has), the input word is
  `(numCols · d)`-close to the quotient code. Union bound over the columns; no CA needed.
* §4 **the per-column DEEP soundness fact** — `deepQuotWord_agree_card_le` /
  `oodValue_correct_of_close`: if the claimed OOD value `v ≠ P.eval z`, the column's quotient word
  agrees with EVERY degree-`< D` codeword in at most `m` places (`m ≥ max (natDegree P) D`), so a
  quotient word inside radius `e` with `e + m < n` FORCES `v = P.eval z`. This is the real content
  of "DEEP quotient in the decoding radius ⟹ the opened value is the true one", per column.
* §5 **the CA consumption point, and what it buys** — `RlcDistributes` (§5) is the ONE named
  hypothesis; `oodValues_correct_of_rlcDistributes` derives, FROM IT AND NOTHING ELSE, that EVERY
  claimed OOD value equals the decoded column's value at `z`. That is sub-piece 2's conclusion,
  conditional on exactly one thing. The hypothesis SHAPE is not a black box:
  `rlcDistributes_one_column` PROVES it at `numCols = 1` (there the RLC is the column itself), so
  what CA supplies is precisely the multi-column strengthening at a nontrivial list size.
* §6 **firing + teeth** — a real `ZMod 17` instance: 4-point domain (the 4th roots of unity),
  out-of-domain `z = 3`, columns `X² + 2X + 3` and `X + 1`. `deepQuot p₀ 3 = X + 5` as a GENUINE
  polynomial identity (`fire_deepQuot0`); its evaluation matches the deployed
  `(p(z) − p(x))·(z − x)⁻¹` numerically (`fire_deepQuot_eval_deployed`, both `= 9`); the 2-column
  α-RLC at `α = 2` computes `11` and the deployed imperative loop returns the same `(4, 11)`
  (`fire_friInputWord` / `fire_reduceOpening`); §2's membership theorem FIRES on the instance
  (`fire_friInputWord_mem_rsCode`), and so does the §5 keystone — `fire_oodValues_correct` shows
  its ENTIRE hypothesis bundle is inhabited (CA discharged there by `rlcDistributes_one_column`),
  so it is not true-by-emptiness. TEETH: `fire_wrong_ood_not_close` — a WRONG opened value `0`
  in place of the true `p₀(3) = 1` puts the quotient word outside radius `1`, so §4 bites; and
  `rlc_single_challenge_no_distribution` exhibits two words whose RLC at `α = 1` is the ZERO
  codeword while the first is not in the code at all — the single-challenge converse is FALSE, which
  is exactly why `RlcDistributes` needs a large `Good` set.

## What is NOT proven — the ONE named hypothesis (`RlcDistributes`, §5)

`RlcDistributes code d L agree u`: if MORE than `L` challenges `α` make the α-RLC
`Σ_j α^j · u_j` `d`-close to `code`, then there are codewords `g_j ∈ code` and a COMMON set of
`≥ agree` domain points on which every `u_j` agrees with `g_j` simultaneously. This is BCIKS20
correlated agreement for the power-RLC family, and it is stated in EXACTLY the shape of the in-tree
affine-line primitive `FriCorrelatedAgreementSharp.CorrelatedAgreementLineAt`
(`FriCorrelatedAgreementSharp.lean:106`) so the sibling CA formalization can discharge it. It is
NOT proven here, NOT axiomatized, and nothing in this file assumes it — it appears only as an
explicit hypothesis of §5's theorems. Going from "the batched RLC word is close" back to "every
column's quotient word is close" is the ONLY step of the DEEP argument this file does not prove,
and it is the exact step correlated agreement exists to supply.

## Honest scope notes (do not read this file as more than it is)

1. **Extension-typed word vs base-field in-tree code.** The deployed input word is `Challenge`
   (degree-4 extension) valued, and this file types it that way. The in-tree deployed FRI instance
   `friSetupDeployed.C = rsCode (pR 8 (2^21) omega24) (2^18 * 8)` is a BABYBEAR (base-field)
   submodule, and `DecodedLdtLink` consumes `MatrixOracle (Fin (8*2^21)) numCols BabyBear`. So
   wiring §2–§5 into `DecodedLdtLink` needs an EXTENSION-typed FRI code object that does not exist
   in the tree yet. That is a real, named gap between this model and the current L5 assembly — this
   file does not paper over it, and no theorem here claims a connection to `friSetupDeployed`.
2. **One matrix, one opening point.** The deployed loop iterates `mat_points_and_values` (several
   OOD points `z` per matrix) and several matrices per batch, with ONE running `alpha_pow` across
   all of them. This file models the inner two loops (one matrix, one `z`, all its columns) —
   the shape the DEEP-ALI argument consumes. The outer concatenation is a further (mechanical)
   generalization: `reduceOpening` already takes an arbitrary term LIST, so the multi-point case is
   the same fold on a longer list, but no theorem below states it.
3. **Merkle binding is assumed elsewhere.** `p_at_x` is the OPENED value; that it equals the
   committed matrix entry is `verify_batch` / the `Poseidon2SpongeCR` floor, not this file.

Additive new file; imports read-only. Sorry-free; no `axiom`; `#assert_all_clean` on every keystone.

`deepQuot p z` is the polynomial `(p(X) − p(z))/(X − z)`. The factor theorem is what makes the
deployed `.inverse()` legitimate: the division is EXACT, so the quotient is a genuine polynomial of
one lower degree, and its evaluation at any in-domain `x` (necessarily `≠ z`, since `z` is
out-of-domain) is exactly the field division the verifier computes. -/

every column `d`-close. The RLC is a POINTWISE functional of the opened row, so a disagreement of
the input word forces a disagreement in some column: a union bound gives the input word
`(numCols · d)`-close. No correlated agreement is used or needed for this direction. -/

/-! ## §4 — The per-column DEEP soundness fact: a WRONG opened value is FAR.

This is the content of "DEEP quotient inside the decoding radius ⟹ the opened value is the true
one", for ONE column. It is a theorem here (no correlated agreement involved): if the claimed OOD
value `v` differs from `P(z)`, then `x ↦ (v − P(x))/(z − x)` agrees with EVERY low-degree word in
at most `m` points, because agreement makes `x` a root of the nonzero degree-`≤ m` polynomial
`C v − P + (X − C z)·q` (nonzero because it evaluates to `v − P(z) ≠ 0` at `z`). -/

/-! ## §5 — The CONVERSE direction: `RlcDistributes`, the correlated-agreement consumption point.

§3 goes columns → batch (a union bound, proved). The DEEP argument needs batch → columns: from
"the ONE reduced word the deployed verifier folds is close to the code" back to "every column's
DEEP-quotient word is close". That is FALSE for a single adversarially-chosen `α` and TRUE, by
BCIKS20 correlated agreement, when many `α` are good. It is stated here as a hypothesis in exactly
the shape of the in-tree affine-line primitive `FriCorrelatedAgreementSharp.CorrelatedAgreementLineAt`
(`FriCorrelatedAgreementSharp.lean:106`) — a `Good : Finset` of challenges, a list-size threshold
`L`, and a COMMON agreement floor — generalized from the 2-term affine line to the `numCols`-term
power-RLC family the deployed reduction actually forms.

**NOT PROVED HERE. NOT AXIOMATIZED.** It occurs only as an explicit hypothesis. -/

/-! ### The §5 keystone is NOT vacuously true — its whole hypothesis bundle is inhabited.

A one-column cut of the same fixture: the committed column, its interpolant, and the honest OOD
value. `rlcDistributes_one_column` discharges the CA hypothesis at `numCols = 1`, the radii satisfy
`(n − agree + d) + m < n`, and `oodValues_correct_of_rlcDistributes` then really runs. (At one
column the conclusion is of course also directly available — the point of this firing is
SATISFIABILITY of the hypothesis bundle, i.e. that the keystone is not true-by-emptiness.) -/
