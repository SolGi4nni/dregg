# `Dregg2.Circuit.FriPositiveRadiusSchedule` — ⚑ THE POSITIVE-RADIUS SCHEDULE, and the precise
reason the FIXED-code `ChainStepGap` cannot carry one.

`FriFoldConsistencyDichotomy` composed FS survival with query payment into
`strategy_soundness_compose` and left exactly ONE named residual: `ChainStepGap C rad d goodSet
fold` — "a `rad`-far word folded at a challenge outside its good set is `(rad+d)`-far" — with the
note that what blocks an instance is that every landed schedule runs at `d = 0`. This file settles
the radius question. Read §1 FIRST: the answer is not "here is the instance".

## §1 — ⚑ THE SHAPE IS WRONG, and that is a THEOREM, not a difficulty

State the trap first, because it is easy to "land" the residual and mean nothing by it: a
`ChainStepGap C rad d goodSet fold` instance at `d > 0` is FREE. Take the by-definition good set
`{ρ | ¬ farN C (rad+d) (fold w ρ)}` and the predicate holds at EVERY margin, at every domain,
for every fold (`chainStepGap_free`). So the residual's content was never the predicate — it is
the CAP `b` on that good set, which is what `strategy_soundness_compose` actually spends
(`hE : ∀ dd, (E dd).card ≤ b`, paying `n·b/|R|`). The tree already says this about the sibling
object: `FriChainStepIdx.goodSet_by_definition_is_free`.

And THE CAP is what cannot be had at a fixed radius. `ChainStepGap` fixes ONE code `C` and ONE
radius `rad` and demands the fold land at `rad + d` — the fold must GAIN `d` of
distance-to-code. Both proximity laws in the tree make it LOSE distance by a fixed factor, and
each is exactly the hypothesis under which the corresponding cap is proved:

  * `FriChainStepIdx.goodδ_card_lt` (CA-free, BBHR18 Vandermonde): the cap `< n` needs the source
    word `n²·d`-far to cap the `d`-good set — a factor `n² = 64` at the deployed arity.
  * `CorrelatedAgreement.Interface.towerGood_card_le` (the CA route): the cap `(m−1)(r+1)` needs
    the constant-RELATIVE-radius law `m·rᵢ₊₁ ≤ rᵢ` — a factor `m = 8`.

Reading `ChainStepGap` as a schedule, it is the CONSTANT schedule `rᵢ ≡ rad` with margin `d`, so
either cap hypothesis reads `c·(rad + d) ≤ rad` with `c ≥ 1`, which is FALSE for `d ≥ 1`
(`constant_radius_margin_infeasible`). So there is no CAPPED `ChainStepGap` instance at `d > 0`
under either proximity law — not at `|ι| = 16`, not at `2^19`, not at any domain, and no bigger
domain fixes it. It is not a missing lemma; the radius has to be allowed to FALL.

And the CA-free `n²` law cannot carry a positive radius at the deployed five-layer `2^19` tower
even with `d = 0`: `rad₀ ≥ 64⁵ = 2³⁰` while every word of `Fin (2^19) → BabyBear` is within
`2^19` of the zero codeword, so layer-0 farness is UNINHABITED there
(`deployed_n2_positive_radius_impossible`, `deployed_n2_positive_margin_impossible`). This is
proved from `Finset.card_le_univ` alone — no covering-radius theory needed.

## §2 — WHAT THE `2^19` TOWER CAN ACTUALLY SUPPORT

The CA route's law is `m·rᵢ₊₁ ≤ rᵢ` at `m = 8`, and the domain shrinks by 8 per layer, so a
CONSTANT RELATIVE radius survives all five welded layers — that is exactly
`CorrelatedAgreement.Theorems.towerRR i = 8^(5−i)`, which is TIGHT (`8·rᵢ₊₁ = rᵢ` at every rung)
and therefore has NO room for a margin. §2 opens the room: `mRR` satisfies the MARGIN law
`8·(mRRᵢ₊₁ + 1) ≤ mRRᵢ` at all five layers while staying inside the classical CA regime
`9·(mRRᵢ₊₁ + 1) + kᵢ₊₁ ≤ nᵢ₊₁` at every layer, and layer-0 farness at `mRR 0 = 37448` is
INHABITED by the tower's own `farWord` (the degree-`2^16` monomial, `2^19 − 2^16 = 458752`-far).
Slack `1` is the CEILING at depth 5: layer 5's classical regime is `9r + 2 ≤ 16`, so
`r₅ + d ≤ 1`; hence `mRR 5 = 0` and the TERMINAL farness of the depth-5 ladder is "not a
codeword", with layers 0–4 at genuinely positive radii `37448, 4680, 584, 72, 8`. A larger margin
costs depth, and §4 spends that trade deliberately.

## §3 — THE LADDER-GRADED OBLIGATION, DISCHARGED

`ChainStepGapLadder` is `ChainStepGap` with the radius allowed to fall: source radius `rᵢ` at
code `Vᵢ`, target radius `rᵢ₊₁ + d` at code `Vᵢ₊₁`. Like `ChainStepGap` (and like
`FriChainStepIdx.goodδ`) it is FREE once the good set is by-definition — the content is the CAP,
and the cap here is `goodMargin_card_le`, proved from the landed per-layer CA
(`CorrelatedAgreementCurveUDParam`) and the landed decimation-lift weld (`DecimLift`), with NO new
hypothesis. `chainStepSlackLadder` is then the Hamming-triangle step the slackened chain consumes
— the ladder form of `FriFoldConsistencyDichotomy.chainStepSlack_of_gap`.

## §4 — ⚑ THE COMPOSED BOUND AT THE DEPLOYED `2^19` TOWER, BOTH ADDENDS MEANINGFUL

`compose_one_round` is `strategy_soundness_compose`'s statement with the radius allowed to FALL
across the round: for an ARBITRARY round-1 commitment `S : F → (Fin n₁ → F)` — no
fold-consistency gate in the statement — the joint probability (random oracle × query sample)
that farness dies AND the fold-consistency spot check passes is at most `b/|F| + (1−δ)^k`. Same
two-branch proof (`winProb_le_add`, `winProb_fst`, `winProb_le_of_fiber`, `accept_prob_le`),
same landed lemmas; what changes is that the surviving-farness radius at round 1 is `r₁`, not
`r₀`, which is what the fold law actually gives.

At the deployed tower, layer 0 → layer 1 of `FriSetupTower.towerS`: `r₀ = 50968`,
`r₁ = 2275`, margin `d = 4096` (so `r₁ + d = 6371`, `8·(r₁+d) = r₀` exactly, and the classical
CA regime `9·(r₁+d) + 2^13 = 65531 ≤ 2^16` holds with 5 to spare), cap `b = 7·6372 = 44604`,
`δ = 1/16` (admissible because `δ·2^16 = 4096 = d`), `k = 38`:

    44604/|BabyBear| + (15/16)^38  <  1        (`deployed_compose_lt_one`)

with `44604/2013265921 ≈ 2.2·10⁻⁵` and `(15/16)^38 ≈ 0.0861`. BOTH addends are real: the FS
addend is a genuine CA-capped bad-set mass, the query addend a genuine sub-1 spot-check mass.
The far hypothesis is INHABITED (`farWord_far_compose`, radius `50968`), which is exactly what
fails at `|ι| = 16` (`FriPositiveRadiusPayment.positive_radius_payment_vacuous_at_friSetupK8`),
and the SURVIVING radius at layer 1 is `2275` (relative `≈ 3.5%` of the `2^16` domain) — positive,
not the degenerate `0`.

⚑ The margin and the surviving radius trade against each other inside ONE budget
`r₁ + d ≤ 6371`: every point of slack handed to the spot check is a point of surviving radius
given up. `δ = 1/16` is what fixes the split here; a larger `δ` buys a smaller `(1−δ)^k` at a
smaller `r₁`.

## What this does NOT say (read before quoting the number)

  * ONE round. The query branch's sample lives on the layer-1 domain `Fin (2^16)`; a
    multi-round version needs a per-layer sample space, which is NOT built here.
  * It does not bind the commitment (no Merkle/extractor), the query model is the uniform
    i.i.d. idealization (`FriQuerySamplingBias` records the deployed sampler is not that), and
    the FS branch prices the ROM challenge, not the deployed transcript.
  * It moves no deployed statement and discharges no FRI/STARK floor. ADDITIVE only.

line added there (deliberately not edited: concurrent lanes).

## Axiom hygiene
`#assert_all_clean` ⊆ {propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}; no `sorry`, no fresh `axiom`, no
`native_decide`. ADDITIVE: no existing module is edited.

hypothesis reads `c·(rad + d) ≤ rad`, which is FALSE for every `c ≥ 1` and `d ≥ 1`. So the
residual `ChainStepGap` at `d > 0` is not a missing lemma at a bigger domain — it is the wrong

/-- **⚑⚑ THE COMPOSED BOUND, ONE ROUND, RADIUS FALLING.** For an ARBITRARY round-1 commitment
`S : F → (Fin n₁ → F)` — adaptive on the FS challenge, with NO fold-consistency gate anywhere in
the statement — the probability, over the random oracle AND the query sample jointly, that

  * farness DIES at round 1 (`S`'s commitment is `r₁`-CLOSE to the layer-1 code), and
  * the verifier's `k`-point fold-consistency spot check PASSES,

is at most `b/|F| + (1−δ)^k`, for any `δ` with `δ·n₁ ≤ d`, where `b` caps the
`(r₁+d)`-good challenge set of `w0`.

This is `FriFoldConsistencyDichotomy.strategy_soundness_compose` with ONE change, and it is the
change §1 proves is forced: the surviving radius at round 1 is `r₁`, NOT the round-0 radius. The
proof is the same two-branch split — `winProb_le_add` unions "the challenge was good" with "the
prover deviated by more than `d` and the spot check still passed", `winProb_fst` lifts the FS
bound off the query coordinate, `winProb_le_of_fiber` + `accept_prob_le` price the query fibre,
and the Hamming triangle is what makes the two branches cover the event. -/
