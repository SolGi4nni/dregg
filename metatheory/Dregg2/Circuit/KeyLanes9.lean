# Dregg2.Circuit.KeyLanes9 — THE OWNER-KEY OCTET. A CANONICITY WRAP CANNOT CLOSE IT.

## SUBSTRATE, SAID OUT LOUD

This is Lean-authored AIR material. Nothing here is written in Rust; the companion
`Dregg2.Circuit.Emit.KeyCanonicity9Emit` emits the constraints and Rust only re-reads them.

## The brief this file REFUTES, and the one it answers instead

`Dregg2.Circuit.Emit.FieldsCanonicity9Emit` closed the FIELDS octet on 2026-07-31 by emitting
`FieldLanes9.Canonical9` — an envelope forcing the committed columns into the encoder's image. The
obvious next move is "apply the same treatment to the owner-key octet at `B_PUBKEY_OCTET`".

**It does not transfer, and the reason is structural.** The fields wrap was a canonicity envelope
around an ALREADY-INJECTIVE nine-lane encoder: `fieldToLanes9_injective` was a theorem, and the only
thing missing was that a prover picks COLUMNS rather than VALUES. The owner-key octet is broken on
BOTH axes at once:

  * **the columns are unforced** — measured 2026-07-31 across all 117 rotated members of both
    emitted registries, the sixteen columns `before_base + {0, B_SPAN} + 105 .. +112` carry ZERO
    range lookups, ZERO `colEq` welds, ZERO gate-body appearances and ZERO `pi_binding`s. Strictly
    emptier than the fields octet was (fields lane 0 was at least welded to the v1 face);
  * **and the ENCODER IS NOT INJECTIVE.** `dregg_commit::typed::canonical_32_to_felts_8` (byte-twins
    at `dregg_cell::commitment::canonical_to_babybear_pi`, `dregg_storage::commitment`, and inlined
    in `circuit/src/effect_vm/trace.rs`) packs `lo | mid1<<8 | mid2<<16 | (hi & 0x3F)<<24` — `8+8+8+6
    = 30` bits per limb. **Bits 6-7 of bytes 3, 7, 11, 15, 19, 23, 27, 31 are DISCARDED**: 16 source
    bits, unbound.

A canonicity envelope forces the columns into the image of a map that is not injective on its
domain. §2's `eight_lane_canonicity_is_not_a_repair` is that sentence as a machine-checked exhibit:
two DISTINCT 32-byte keys whose octets are equal AND fully canonical. **The wrap, fully forced,
still admits a second preimage — constructed, not searched, one bit flip.** Emitting the eight-lane
wrap alone would be shipping a containment while naming the real fix as a later phase.

## What this file authors instead: the ninth lane, and its canonicity

§3 is the replacement encoder — a base-`2^29` NONET over the 32 bytes, little-endian:

```text
  keyWord b = ofDigits 256 [b 0, …, b 31]              -- the key as a 256-bit number
  keyToLanes9 b i = the i-th base-2^29 digit of it     -- nine lanes, i = 0..8
```

`2^29 = 536870912 < p`, so **no lane ever reduces**; `8·29 = 232 < 256 ≤ 9·29 = 261`, so nine is the
minimum and eight is refuted by `FieldLanes9.nine_lanes_is_the_minimum` (`P^8 < 2^256`) — the same
pigeonhole `MapOpWideKeyPigeonhole.no_injection_bytes32_to_canonKey8` already carries for the
arity-17 address slot. `keyLanes9ToBytes` is a TOTAL decoder and `keyToLanes9_injective` follows
from a machine-checked left inverse. Not a hash bound.

§4 is the canonicity envelope, and it has exactly **two legs and no gates**:

  1. `LanesRanged` — lanes 0..7 below `2^29`. *Eight range lookups.*
  2. `TopLaneRanged` — lane 8 below `2^24`. *ONE range lookup, at a DIFFERENT width.*

`canonicalKey9_iff_in_image` proves the two together are EXACTLY the image. No `NoWrap` leg, no cube
gate, no aux columns: the fields octet needed those because its lanes 0/1 were a `mod p` REDUCTION
it could not move (welded to the v1 face). The key octet is welded to nothing, so the encoding was
replaced wholesale and the reduction disappeared with it.

⚑ **AND LEG 2 IS NOT A CONSEQUENCE OF LEG 1 — that is the exhibit.** `forgedKeyNonet = [0,…,0,2^24]`
has every lane below `2^29`, so it passes a UNIFORM nine-lane `< 2^29` lookup — the naive reading of
"range-check the lanes". Its value is `2^24 · (2^29)^8 = 2^256`, which the total decoder reads
modulo `2^256` as the ALL-ZERO key. So it decodes byte-for-byte to the honest zero key's decode
while being a different committed vector. `uniform_lane_ranges_do_not_force_the_image` is that, and
it is the exact structural twin of `FieldLanes9.free_lane_ranges_alone_do_not_force_the_image`.

## ⚑ THE PRICE, SAID OUT LOUD — this is a RE-GENESIS, not a re-emit

The fields wrap was cheap because its 112 aux columns rode the appendix, past every committed limb.
**A ninth KEY lane cannot ride the appendix**: an appendix column is not in `preLimbsAt`, so it
never enters the `wireCommitR` absorption chain, so it is a free felt carrying nothing — `state_commit`
would still bind only 232 bits of the key. The ninth lane must be an ABSORBED PRE-LIMB.

  * the pre-limb region was **184/184 full** (`ROTATED_PADS` is `[usize; 0]`; the two former pads were
    eaten by the fields nonet), so `rotatedNumPreLimbs` had to GROW;
  * ⚑ and it had to grow to **187, not 185**. `B_SPAN := n + 3 + (n − 4) / 3` is `Nat` floor division
    while the real carrier chain is `chunk31`, whose `chunkCount (n+3) = chunkCount n + 1`. At
    `n = 185` the formula gives 60 and the chain needs 61 — the block is silently under-allocated by
    one carrier column. The invariant nobody wrote down is `rotatedNumPreLimbs ≡ 1 (mod 3)`.
    `184 → 187` buys exactly three limbs: one ninth lane each for `public_key`, `child_vk` and
    `contract_hash`, all three of which are 8-lane and all three of which this counting kills.
  * growing the pre-limbs moves every `state_commit`, so `persist`'s
    `CANONICAL_STATE_SCHEMA_EPOCH` must be bumped and the chain re-genesised. (Do not transcribe a
    remembered epoch number: read the constant.)

✅ **LANDED 2026-08-01 — `rotatedNumPreLimbs` IS 187.** `RotatedLayout.rotated187` allocates the
three ninth lanes at in-block limbs 184 (`child_vk`), 185 (`contract_hash`) and 186
(**`public_key`**), `Legal.octetNonets` makes an octet without a ninth lane unconstructable, and
`EffectVmEmitRotationV3.preLimbsAt` now folds all 187 — so the owner key's ninth lane is inside the
list `wireCommitR` absorbs. The companion's `deployedKeyCanon9Cols` has NO free column left but the
face width, `deployed_nonet_is_absorbed` proves all nine lanes are absorbed pre-limbs, and
`keyCanon9_determines_the_owner_key_deployed` states the capstone against `preLimbsAt` entries
rather than bare columns.

⚠ **WHAT THIS FILE STILL DOES NOT REACH.** The envelope is authored, proved and geometrically
placed; it is NOT yet appended to any live member's constraint list, no descriptor has been
re-emitted, no VK rotated and no chain re-genesised. A Rust `key_limbs9` producer must fill limb 186
(and 184/185) or every honest turn is UNSAT. State that rung exactly and do not round it up.

Unlike the fields nonet there is no third leg to find: the packer is surjective onto the canonical

/-! ## §2 — ⚑ THE REFUTATION: the canonicity wrap, FULLY FORCED, still admits a second preimage.

`zeroKey` and `bit6Key` differ in byte 3 — the key `0x00…00` against the key with `0x40` at index 3.
Both are 32-byte strings; they are DISTINCT. The packer's `& 0x3F` erases bit 6 of that byte, so
their octets are IDENTICAL and both are fully canonical. No search, no birthday bound, no hash
assumption: one bit flip, `O(1)`.

⚑ Byte 3 is not special. The same flip works at bytes 7, 11, 15, 19, 23, 27, 31, at bit 6 or bit 7 —
`2^16` strings share every octet. -/

/-- **THE EXHIBIT.** Two DISTINCT 32-byte keys, both encoding to the SAME octet, and that octet
fully `KeyCanonical8`. So an emitted eight-lane canonicity envelope — even the exact-image one of
`keyCanonical8_iff_in_image` — admits the forgery, and the committed octet does not determine the
owner key. This is why the fields treatment does not transfer. -/

absorb the whole octet and `compress_member` recomputes from bytes — and the octet is welded to
nothing (measured: zero `colEq`, zero gates, zero PIs). So unlike the fields lanes 0/1 the encoding
can be replaced WHOLESALE, and the replacement is the simplest injective one that fits: the key read

/-! ### ⚑ THE EXHIBIT — why a UNIFORM nine-lane `< 2^29` lookup is NOT the fix.

`forgedKeyNonet = [0, …, 0, 2^24]`. Every lane is below `2^29`, so it passes the naive uniform
range check on ALL NINE lanes. Its recomposed value is `2^24 · (2^29)^8 = 2^256` exactly — one full
wrap — and the total decoder reads base-256 digits `0..31`, all of which are zero. So it decodes
byte-for-byte to the ALL-ZERO key, which is also what the honest zero key's nonet decodes to, while
being a DIFFERENT committed vector.

⚑ This is the same wound the fields octet had (`forgedLanes = [0,…,0,3·2^24]` passing all seven
`< 2^28` lookups), at a different width, and it is why leg 2 rides a NARROWER table rather than the
lane table. Note what it does NOT assume: nothing about lanes 0..7, no producer honesty. Lane 8
alone. -/

every lane, is NOT the honest vector, decodes to the honest key anyway, and fails ONLY

/-! ## §5 — THE VERDICT, in one proposition.

Stated together so a reader cannot take the pleasant half. The deployed eight-lane octet does not
determine the owner key even under its exact-image canonicity envelope; the nine-lane replacement
does, under an envelope that is two lookups' worth of width and one lookup's worth of narrowing. -/

/-- **THE VERDICT.** (1) the deployed packer conflates two distinct keys whose octets are canonical;
(2) the nine-lane replacement is injective; (3) its canonicity envelope is exactly its image; and
(4) the naive uniform range check does not reach that envelope. -/
