# `Dregg2.Circuit.MapAafiLiveRepoint` — the `.aafiInsert` arm REPOINTED: the arm that SHIPS, given
  non-vacuous laws at the deployed leaf shape, plus the ELEVENTH impossibility that fixes exactly
  what the post side can and cannot say.

`MapInsertImtRepoint` §8 found that `MapOpsColumnLayout.ReconcileGatesAt`'s `.write`, `.insert` and
`.aafiInsert` arms are **the same body**, so `reconcileGates_insert_forces_key_present` was never
about `.insert` — and that the two literal op = 3 MapOps are ORPHANS while `.aafiInsert` is what the
prover runs. This file repoints THAT arm, and lands the positive result the `.insert` arm could not
have: the deployed AAFI gate is genuinely STRONG, so its post side IS forced — just not into any
shape a `MapLeafSchema` can express.

## PREMISES, RE-VERIFIED AT HEAD (all four confirmed; SIX citations corrected, one list extended)

* `ReconcileGatesAt`'s `.write` / `.insert` / `.aafiInsert` arms are the same body, character for
  character, at `MapOpsColumnLayout.lean:840-856` (the finding cited `:825-842`; the file moved).
* `insert_witness_aafi` is `heap_root.rs:1157` — NOT `:1077-1156`, which is the tail of
  `update_witness8` plus the doc block. Its present-key refusal IS at `:1167-1169` as cited
  (`if self.position_of(key).is_some() { return None }`), and `:1188-1189`'s pointer-bracket refusal
  is a second, independent freshness guard. `insert_witness`'s twin refusal is `:1092-1094`; the
  `MapInsertImtRepoint` header's `:1091-1093` is one line off.
* `Ir2Air::MapOps` is `descriptor_ir2.rs:3253-3563`, not `:3232-3541`. `rw_sel = not_insert + s` and
  `not_insert3 = not_insert + 2s` ARE at `:3298-3299` as cited, and `s·(op−4) = 0` at `:3288` pins
  `s = 0` off op = 4. ⚠ The free-slot `ZERO8` pin is `:3514-3516`, **NOT** `:3493-3495` — those lines
  are inside gate (c)'s PATH1 loop. The five op = 4 gates are (a) `:3371-3378` + `:3402-3405`,
  (b) `:3436-3475`, (c) `:3477-3508`, (d1) `:3510-3534`, (d2) `:3536-3557`.
* **`.aafiInsert` SHIPS, and the reach is one effect WIDER than the brief said.** `"op":"aafi_insert"`
  appears on eight descriptors in each of three committed registries — `noteSpend`, **`noteCreate`**,
  `revoke`, `createCell`, `factory`, `spawn`, `spawnCapOpen`, `spawnWriteCapOpen`. The brief's list
  omitted `noteCreate` / `commitmentsInsertOp`. Histogram over all seven registry TSVs:
  `aafi_insert` 24 rows, `absent` 24, `write` 4, **`insert` 0.** The orphanhood of `insertWriteOp` /
  `insertWriteOpRot` is confirmed twice: no `.mapOp` wiring in the Lean, no `"op":"insert"` row in any
  emitted descriptor.
* The generic prover-side fill `descriptor_ir2.rs:5265-5271` calls `insert_witness_aafi` for EVERY
  `MapKind::AafiInsert` row, from `build_traces` → `prove_vm_descriptor2_inner`, so all eight deployed
  descriptors run the present-key refusal on every prove. `next_free_index` is `sorted_leaves.len()`
  and is never re-compacted (`:1006`, `:1204`, and `:1212`'s own `debug_assert_eq!`), so the honest
  free slot is exactly the first padding cell — which §1 handles as an EQUALITY and §5 generalizes to
  every free slot the AIR actually admits.

## THE THREE RESULTS

### 1. THE REPOINT, AND THE POST SIDE IS FORCED IN FULL (§3, §4, §6)

`MapKindImtGates.aafiImtGates_force_absence_or_resid` consumes gates (a) and (b) only and stops at
the PRE side. `AafiLayoutAt` / `aafiImtGates_force_layout_or_resid` extract all five. An accepting
op = 4 row forces the post-root column to be the fold of a vector that is the committed pre-vector
with **exactly two cells changed**: position `p1` (the low leaf — its ADDRESS and VALUE untouched, its
POINTER moved `lowNext → key`) and position `p2`, which is FORCED to have held the padding constant
(`h.length ≤ p2 < 2 ^ dep`, DERIVED from gate (d1)'s pinned `ZERO8`, not assumed).

⚑ THE CONTRAST THAT MAKES THIS THE PAYOFF. `MapInsertImtRepoint.insertPair_erases_the_rest_of_the_map`
exhibits an accepting `.absent` + op = 3 pair whose post-root commits a map with the OTHER ENTRY
DELETED, because neither row relates the pre-root to the post-root. `aafiLayout_admits_no_erasure`
proves the live arm cannot do that: every cell other than `p1` and `p2` is *literally* the
pre-commitment's cell. The map-preservation nobody checks for op = 3 **is checked** for op = 4.

### 2. ⚑ THE ELEVENTH APPROACH, AND IT WORKS: A LAYOUT-LEVEL DENOTATION (§5)

Ten of the last eleven obvious approaches on this epoch were proved impossible. The eleventh — "give
the denotation an ORDER coordinate", which §12.4 of the design doc named without taking — works, and
what it buys is not a consolation prize:

> `aafiImtRow_forces_insertsUpToLayout_of_good` — an accepting deployed AAFI row forces
> `AafiInsertsUpToLayout`: there is an admissible sparse pre-map `h` behind the pre-root at which the
> row's key is ABSENT, and the post-root is the fold of a list that is a **`List.Perm` of the padded
> commitment vector of `Heap.set h key value`**.

Freshness AND total map preservation, at the deployed padded arity-3 leaf, floor-free. The engine is
`chain_relink_snoc_perm`: the deployed physical layout — pre-chain, low leaf relinked, new leaf
appended at the free slot — IS the relinked chain of the correctly-inserted map, permuted. So
`heap_root.rs:1139-1141`'s *"a distinct commitment lineage from the sorted-compacted `root8` (same
leaf SET, different positions)"* becomes a theorem with the "same leaf SET" half PROVED and the
"different positions" half localized to one `List.Perm`.

### 3. ⚑⚑ THE ELEVENTH IMPOSSIBILITY — the post-root is not a commitment AT ALL (§7)

The eighth impossibility (`no_schema_commits_the_append_order_layout`) refuted a UNIFORM law: *for
every chain and every permuted layout…*. This refutes the post side at ONE deployed row, for EVERY
key and EVERY value:

> `aafi_interior_post_admits_no_opening` — the post-root an accepting op = 4 row produces over the
> pre-map `[(1,7),(9,3)]` at fresh key `5` satisfies `¬ opensToMerkleS (padImtSchema 100) … k o` for
> **every** `k` and **every** `o`. It is the `commit` of no admissible heap whatsoever, because the
> append-order address list is `[1, 9, 5]` and every `imtChainOf`'s is strictly increasing.

Consequence: `insertsFreshS` — `MapInsertImtRepoint`'s honest limit for the op = 3 pairing — is NOT
available at the AAFI post side either (`aafi_post_cannot_be_insertsFreshS`), because its second
conjunct is an `opensToMerkleS`. **§5's layout statement is not a weakened convenience; it is the only
shape the deployed AAFI post-condition has.** `aafi_interior_row_at_depth2` is a REAL accepting row
(every path obligation `rfl`) so the refutation bites on gate data, not on a hypothetical root.

## THE WIDE TWIN (§9)

`MapOpWideKeyWeld.demoInsertGateW_accepts` ran `MapOpKind.insert` at `keyLo`, which `demoHeapW`
ALREADY HOLDS — the wide twin of the narrow `toy_insert_gates` blind spot. It is RENAMED
`demoValueUpdateGateW_accepts` in place, with `demoValueUpdateGateW_key_is_already_committed`
promoted from prose to a theorem beside it. ⚑ A fresh-key twin at the wide shape does not exist and
CANNOT be written, and the obstruction is FLOOR-FREE: `wide_insert_never_grows_the_map` — the
denotation both write-shaped wide arms conclude (`writesToMerkleW`) has `h.length = 2 ^ dep` on BOTH
sides of the write, so every witness has its key already committed, at every `LaneEnc` and every
depth. That impossibility is the deliverable.

## Axiom hygiene
`#assert_axioms` ⊆ {propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}; sorry-free; no `native_decide`; no
`decide` over any depth-16 object — every depth-16 exhibit reuses `MapKindImtGates`'s symbolic
`leftPadPath` / `slot1Path` recursions and NAMES its roots as the schema's own `commit`.
**NO FLOOR CARRIER**: `Poseidon2SpongeCR` and `Compress8CR` appear in no type and no `def` body here;
every law is the `_or_resid` / `_of_good` pair at `MapGood = Function.Injective ∧ PadFree3`, which is
`padImtTeeth`'s own `Good` field, and all three residuals are at SPECIFIC named witnesses.
Lean-only; no Rust, descriptor, emit or JSON byte touched.

/-! ## §1 — PADDING ALGEBRA FOR THE FREE SLOT: overwriting a padding cell IS appending.

Gate (d1) pins the free slot to the padding constant, so the AAFI append writes into the padding.
These three lemmas turn "cell `p2` of the padded vector was replaced" into "one entry joined the live
prefix": an EQUALITY when `p2` is the FIRST free slot (which is what `next_free_index` always is), and
a `List.Perm` at every other free slot, which is all the AIR actually forces. -/

/-! ## §9 — THE WIDE TWIN: the blind spot, and the impossibility that IS the fix.

`MapOpWideKeyWeld.demoInsertGateW_accepts` ran `MapOpKind.insert` at `keyLo`, which `demoHeapW`
ALREADY HOLDS. It is RENAMED `demoValueUpdateGateW_accepts` in that file, with
`demoValueUpdateGateW_key_is_already_committed` promoted from prose to a theorem beside it.

⚑ A fresh-key twin at the wide shape does not exist and CANNOT be written. Below is why, FLOOR-FREE:
the denotation both write-shaped wide arms conclude has `h.length = 2 ^ dep` on the pre-heap AND on
the written heap, and `Heap.length_set_fresh` grows by exactly one. So the DENSE extraction premise —
not any hash property — forbids growth, at every `LaneEnc` and every depth. That impossibility is the
deliverable; there is nothing to add a witness for. -/

/-! ## §10 — ⚑ THE FLOOR-RATCHET ENTRIES, ADJUDICATED — and the premise this lane was handed is a
CATEGORY ERROR that has to be corrected before any of them can be read.

The brief (and `MapInsertImtRepoint` §9:885) says *"NINE of these are registered keystones in
`Dregg2/Verify/FloorRatchetBaseline.lean`, so the vacuity is load-bearing in the assurance case."*
Three things about that sentence are wrong, and the third one matters most.

**(i) `FloorRatchetBaseline` IS NOT A KEYSTONE REGISTRY.** Its own header (`:1-14`) says what it is:
*"Every name here is a declaration whose type takes a hypothesis this tree PROVES FALSE at deployed
BabyBear parameters, so the declaration is VACUOUS. They are grandfathered because they cannot all be
ported at once — this file is the RATCHET, and its only healthy direction is SHORTER."* Registration
is a recorded ADMISSION of vacuity, not a load-bearing claim. Structurally it is twelve flat
`Array String` literals of declaration names (`c0`..`c10` + `manual`), concatenated at `:2282-2283`;
there is no keystone field, no satisfiability witness, no teeth.

**(ii) THE KEYSTONE MECHANISM IS A DIFFERENT INSTRUMENT, AND NONE OF THESE NAMES IS IN IT.**
`Dregg2/Verify/KeystoneLint.lean`'s `@[load_bearing_keystone satisfiable := … teeth := …]` +
`#keystone_audit` is the instrument that demands a non-vacuity witness and a discriminating
counter-instance. Zero `@[load_bearing_keystone]` attributes exist on any §9 name, and none appears
in `metatheory/docs/KEYSTONE-LEDGER.md`.

**(iii) ⚑ THE REAL FINDING IS WORSE THAN THE ONE CLAIMED: NO LIVE GATE SEES THIS VACUITY AT ALL.**
The ten entries below are baselined because they carry the REFUTED `Poseidon2SpongeCR` floor — a
different axis entirely. Their PREMISE vacuity (the hypothesis is false on every deployed row) is
invisible to the floor ratchet, invisible to `#keystone_audit`, and invisible to
`check-floor-baseline-preflight.sh`. The vacuity is not "load-bearing in the assurance case"; it is
UNDETECTED, which is the sharper problem.

**⚠ AND THE PRESCRIBED REMEDY WOULD TURN THE GATE RED.** The brief says such an entry *"should be
removed from the baseline"*. It must NOT be, while the declaration still carries the floor:
`FloorRatchet.check` (`:524-530`) errors on any carrier NOT in the baseline, and reports a baseline
name that is no longer a carrier as harmless SLACK. Deleting a live carrier's line is a build ERROR,
not a cleanup. The only legal way off the baseline is to make the declaration stop carrying the
floor — i.e. to port it to the `_or_resid` idiom, which is what this file and `MapKindImtGates` do
for the narrow shape.

### The line numbers, corrected

Of the nine cited baseline lines, **one** (`:941`) lands on a name §9 discusses. `:945` and `:973`
are the `.read` legs — the ones §9 itself calls SOUND; `:984`/`:988` are group-B names; `:985` is
`noLeafColl_of_CR`; `:2042`/`:2046` are in `FinInjectivityCollapse` and `Freshness`, unrelated
modules. The cited set is consistent with an off-by-one against `{940, 944, 972, 983, 984, 987}`
after one baseline line was deleted, but even then two entries are group B and two are unrelated.
The real count is **TEN, not nine**, and here they are with their true lines.

### The ten, adjudicated

| baseline | declaration | verdict |
|---|---|---|
| `:940` | `MapOpWideKeyRowBoundary.demoRow_insert_then_absent_unsat` | **RESTATE.** Its accepting-row input is the mislabeled `demoInsertGateW_accepts`, renamed here; the theorem is TRUE and non-vacuous *as a statement about a VALUE UPDATE*, which is what its input actually is. Its name over-claims. Keep, rename its subject, keep the baseline line (still a floor carrier). |
| `:941` | `…demoRow_insert_then_absent_unsat_via_abstract` | **RESTATE**, same reason, same input. |
| `:944` | `…gates_force_holdsKindW_insert_row` | **STAYS VACUOUS on deployed rows** — `.insert` rows do not exist in any emitted descriptor (`"op":"insert"` = 0 across all seven registries), so its hypothesis is unsatisfiable *at deployment* for a second, independent reason. Not removable from the baseline (live floor carrier). The honest fix is DELETION of the arm, which is a deployed-side scope call, not this lane's. |
| `:965` | `MapOpWideKeyWeld.demoInsert_then_absent_unsat` | **RESTATE** (value-update subject, as `:940`). |
| `:966` | `…demoInsert_then_absent_unsat_via_abstract` | **RESTATE**, same. |
| `:972` | `…gates_force_holdsKindW_insert` | **STAYS VACUOUS**, as `:944`. |
| `:2066` | `MapOpWideKeyRowBoundary.gates_insertW_absentW_jointly_unsat_row` | **STAYS VACUOUS on `.insert`**; but note its `.aafiInsert` TWIN (`:2065`) is the live one, and §9 of this file adjudicates that separately. |
| `:2068` | `…gates_jointly_unsat_via_abstract_row'` | **STAYS VACUOUS**, as `:2066`. |
| `:2070` | `MapOpWideKeyWeld.gates_insertW_absentW_jointly_unsat` | **STAYS VACUOUS**, as `:2066`. |
| `:2072` | `…gates_jointly_unsat_via_abstract'` | **STAYS VACUOUS**, as `:2066`. |

Three group-A names §9 lists are **correctly ABSENT** from the baseline, and this is not an omission:
`MapOpWideKeyGate.insertW_absentW_jointly_unsat'`, `MapOpWideKey.insertW_sound` and
`.insertW_then_absentW_unsat` quantify over an abstract `Opens` with no floor binder, so they are not
floor carriers at all. They are still PREMISE-vacuous at deployment via their instantiations, and
nothing records that.

### The A′ set — the LIVE arm — is what this file repairs

`gates_force_holdsKindW_aafiInsert` (`MapOpWideKeyWeld:313`), its `_row` twin (`:340` of
`MapOpWideKeyRowBoundary`, baselined at `:942`), `gates_aafiInsertW_absentW_jointly_unsat` (`:348`),
`gates_jointly_unsat_via_abstract` (`:361`), `gates_aafiInsertW_absentW_jointly_unsat_row` (`:387`,
baselined `:2065`), `gates_jointly_unsat_via_abstract_row` (`:409`), `MapOpWideKeyGate`'s
`insertW_absentW_jointly_unsat` (`:921`) and `MapOpWideKey.aafiInsertW_sound` (`:419`): these are the
ones whose rows are EMITTED, and every one of them routes the `.aafiInsert` kind through
`ReconcileGatesAtW`'s write-shaped body, whose hypothesis is false on every honest deployed AAFI row.

**VERDICT: RESTATE, and the narrow replacement is landed here.** `MapOpImtAafiHoldsAt` /
`mapOpsArmImtAafi_of_modeler` / `aafiImtRow_forces_both_sides_of_good` are the deployed-shape
substitutes at the narrow key: same arm, same rows, true premise, floor-free, both sides forced.
⚠ NAMED RESIDUAL, not closed here: the WIDE-key (`Digest8Key`) versions of these do not exist. The
wide analogue of `padOpen_binds_or_resid` — an arity-3 padded opening extractor at 8-felt lanes with
named residuals instead of `Poseidon2SpongeCR` — is the missing piece, and it is the same piece the
whole wide file needs to leave the baseline. Naming it is not closing it. -/
