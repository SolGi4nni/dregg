# `Dregg2.Circuit.MapInsertImtRepoint` — the `.insert` arm REPOINTED onto the deployed shape, and
  the TWO limits repointing runs into on this arm (both proved, neither named-and-left).

`MapKindImtGates` (stage 2 proper) found the `.absent` disease on a SECOND host: the arity-2
`.insert` model demands an OLD-leaf path to the PRE-root, which BINDS the row's key into the
committed pre-heap (`reconcileGates_insert_forces_key_present`), while the deployed builder
`heap_root.rs::insert_witness` REFUSES an insert whose key is already present (`:1091-1093`,
`if self.position_of(key).is_some() { return None }`). So on every honest deployed insert row the
model's hypothesis is FALSE (`reconcileGates_insert_unsat_at_fresh_key`). This file does for
`.insert` what `MapAbsentImtGate` → `MapReconcileImtRepoint` did for `.absent`: model the shipped
arm 1:1, make it the PRIMARY dispatch, keep the arity-2 arm available, and state the limit plainly.

## THE DEPLOYED `.insert` (op = 3), read in `circuit/src/descriptor_ir2.rs` (`Ir2Air::MapOps`)

`not_insert = 1 − 6⁻¹·op·(op−1)` is `0` at op = 3 (`:3277-3278`), and `s` (the committed AAFI
selector) is pinned to `0` off op = 4 (`:3288`), so `rw_sel = not_insert + s = 0` and
`not_insert3 = not_insert + 2s = 0` (`:3298-3299`). Consequence, in the AIR's own comment: *"insert
opens the NEW leaf against the NEW root (no old leaf at a fresh key)"* (`:3385-3386`). **There is no
old-leaf absorb, no PATH1 fold to `MAP_ROOT`, and therefore no constraint on the pre-root at all.**
The enum says what is supposed to make up the difference: *"Freshness must be established
separately, e.g. by a paired `MapKind::Absent` opening against the same pre-root"* (`:540-542`).

## THE THREE RESULTS

### 1. THE REPOINT EXISTS, IS PRIMARY, AND THE TWO SHAPES ARE INCOMPARABLE (§3, §5)

`ReconcileGatesImtInsertAt` dispatches `.insert` to the deployed op = 3 body
(`MapKindImtGates.InsertImtRowAt` at the row's own columns) and leaves every other kind at
`ReconcileGatesAt`, verbatim — the same two-guarded-arms shape `MapReconcileImtRepoint` used for
`.absent`. `MapInsertReconcileModelOk` is the drop-in per-trace twin of `MapReconcileModelOk`, and
`mapOpsArmImtInsert_of_modeler` delivers the repointed per-row denotation for every declared map op.

⚑ INCOMPARABLE, both directions concrete, exactly as `.absent`'s turned out to be — and here by TWO
independent mechanisms on the deployed side:
  * on the honest deployed row (`MAP_TREE_DEPTH = 16`, sparse tree, FRESH key `5`) the OLD model is
    FALSE **(A) by the COMMITMENT** — its `∃ h, mapRoot hash 16 h = root` cannot hold at a padded
    arity-3 pre-root (`insert_old_model_false_deployed_commitment`) — and **(B) by the FRESH KEY**,
    in the counterfactual arity-2 world at the same depth, over the epoch's own `spineC` spine
    (`insert_old_model_false_fresh_key_at_depth`); the REPOINTED model HOLDS on that row;
  * on the epoch's own toy `.insert` row the OLD model holds and the repointed one is EMPTY, because
    that row's post-root column is a `mapRoot` and never a `padImtRoot`.
`insert_models_are_incomparable` bundles it. Neither refines the other; the deployed one is the one
that describes the shipped table.

⚑ THE ARITY WALL, FLOOR-FREE AND PADDED. `MapReconcileImtRepoint.imtRoot_ne_mapRoot` needed the
refuted `Poseidon2SpongeCR` and was stated at the UNPADDED commitment — its residual #1. Here
`padImtRoot_ne_mapRoot_of_good` proves the same separation at the DEPLOYED PADDED commitment from
`Function.Injective` + `PadFree2` alone, with the sparse (`≤`) occupancy on the IMT side. No floor.

### 2. ⚑⚑ `.insert` HAS NO SOUND STANDALONE DENOTATION — AND THE PAIRING DOES NOT RESCUE IT (§6)

`MapKindImtGates.insertImtGates_cannot_force_the_write_denotation` already refuted the standalone
opener. The obvious next move — and the one the DEPLOYMENT ITSELF names — is the pairing: an
`.absent` row against the same pre-root establishes freshness. So model the pairing and ask.

`InsertPairRowAt` is that composition as a FIRST-CLASS OBJECT: a deployed `Ir2Air::MapAbsent` row at
the padded commitment (§2, which also closes `MapReconcileImtRepoint`'s residual #1 on the gate law)
plus a deployed op = 3 row. What it FORCES is `insertsFreshS` — *the key was absent before and is
present at the written value after* (`insertPair_forces_insertsFresh_of_good`). What it does NOT
force is the write denotation, and that is REFUTED, not unproved:

> ⚑⚑ `insertPair_cannot_force_the_write_denotation` / `insertPair_erases_the_rest_of_the_map` — at
> `MAP_TREE_DEPTH = 16`, an accepting `.absent`+`.insert` PAIR over the pre-root of `[(1,7)]` sits
> beside a post-root committing `[(5,2)]`: key `5` is genuinely fresh, key `5` genuinely lands, and
> **key `1` has been ERASED**. `writesToMerkleS` is FALSE on that pair.

So the answer to "is `.insert` sound only in composition?" is **no — it is not sound in the named
composition either.** The pairing buys FRESHNESS; nothing in it buys PRESERVATION of the rest of the
map, because neither row constrains the pre-root and the post-root TOGETHER. `insertsFreshS` is
what the pair denotes, it is strictly weaker than `writesToMerkleS`
(`insertPair_is_strictly_weaker_than_the_write_denotation` exhibits one pair in both and one pair in
only the weak one), and it is the object a consumer of op = 3 rows may actually assume today.

### 3. ⚑⚑ THE TENTH IMPOSSIBILITY — no SINGLE-PATH row can denote an interior sorted insert (§7)

Nine obvious approaches on this epoch were proved impossible; this is the tenth, and it forecloses
the natural repair rather than leaving it to be tried. The natural repair for §6 is to add the
AAFI-style gate (d1) to op = 3: *"the slot was EMPTY under the pre-root"*, folding the padding
constant up the SAME sibling path. Any such gate set — indeed ANY gate set that reuses the one
deployed `MAP_SIB0`/`MAP_DIR0` path — changes **exactly one cell** of the committed digest vector
(`padOpen_binds_or_resid`'s update clause is literally `(padVec …).set (pathPos steps) …`). But
`heap_root.rs::insert_witness` splices the fresh leaf into its SORTED position and RE-COMPACTS, so
at an interior key the post-vector differs from the pre-vector in the inserted cell, in every
shifted cell, AND in the predecessor's POINTER.

> `interior_sorted_insert_moves_more_than_one_cell` — inserting `5` into `[(1,7),(9,3)]` moves
> positions `0` and `1` (and `2`); one `List.set` cannot do it, at any depth ≥ 2.
> `singlePath_postRoot_is_not_the_sorted_insert` lifts that to ROOTS: the post-root a one-path row
> can produce is NEVER the sorted-insert commitment there.

Hence op = 3 cannot be repaired into soundness on its own shape at all: **the two-path AAFI op is
not an optimisation of `.insert`, it is the only shape in which a fresh-key insert is expressible.**
That is a deployed-side conclusion, and it is the same verdict `heap_root.rs` reached in prose
(*"no shared pre-image binds the shifted suffix"*, `descriptor_ir2.rs:545-547`) — now a theorem.

## ⚠ THE EPOCH'S OWN `.insert` EXHIBIT WAS A VALUE UPDATE, AND IS RENAMED

`MapOpsColumnLayout.toy_insert_gates` wrote key `20` into `toyHeap`, which HOLDS key `20` — a value
update wearing an insert's name, and the only `.insert` non-vacuity the epoch had. It is now
`toy_insert_op_value_update_gates` / `_fires`, with `toy_insert_op_key_is_already_committed` as a
THEOREM rather than a `#guard`. A fresh-key witness for it does not exist and cannot be written:
that is `reconcileGates_insert_unsat_at_fresh_key`. The REAL insert exhibit is §4's, at the deployed
depth on the deployed shape, and it is the first fresh-key `.insert` witness this epoch has had.

## BLAST RADIUS — what rested on the arity-2 `.insert` model (§8 lists it in full)

## Axiom hygiene
`#assert_axioms` ⊆ {propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}; sorry-free; no `native_decide`; no
`decide` on any object containing the depth-16 spine — every depth-16 exhibit NAMES its root and
builds its path by the symbolic `leftPadPath` / `slot1Path` / `spineC` recursions of the modules it
reuses. **NO FLOOR CARRIER**: `Poseidon2SpongeCR` and `Compress8CR` appear in no type and no `def`
body here; every law is `MapKindImtGates`'s `_or_resid` / `_of_good` pair at
`MapGood = Function.Injective ∧ PadFree3`, which is `padImtTeeth`'s own `Good` field. NEW file;

/-! ## §1 — THE ARITY WALL AT THE DEPLOYED PADDED COMMITMENT, FLOOR-FREE.

`MapReconcileImtRepoint.imtRoot_ne_mapRoot` separates the arity-3 IMT root from the arity-2 `mapRoot`
under the REFUTED `Poseidon2SpongeCR` floor and at the UNPADDED commitment (its named residual #1:
*"every statement here is at the unpadded commitment form"*). Both limitations go here: the
separation holds at `padImtRoot` — the deployed sparse, zero-padded, arity-3 fold — from
`Function.Injective` + `PadFree2` alone. Those are two fields of `padImtTeeth`'s idealisation, not a
new hash property, and `oddSponge` inhabits both. -/

/-! ## §2 — THE DEPLOYED `.absent` GATE AT THE **PADDED** COMMITMENT.

`MapAbsentImtGate.AbsentImtGatesAt` models the deployed `Ir2Air::MapAbsent` table (one arity-3
low-leaf opening whose digest BINDS the pointer, the bracket `lo_addr < key < low_next`, and
`MA_NEW_ROOT = MA_ROOT`) — but at the UNPADDED commitment, and under `Poseidon2SpongeCR`. §6 needs
the `.absent` row and the `.insert` row to speak about the SAME committed object, which is the
deployed sparse padded tree, so the arm is restated here at `padImtSchema` in `MapKindImtGates`'s
floor-free idiom. That closes `MapReconcileImtRepoint`'s residual #1 for the gate law: the deployed
`.absent` soundness now holds at the commitment `CanonicalHeapTree8::new` actually builds.

⚠ What is NOT closed by that: the residual also covered the WALL theorems and the apex wiring, which
are untouched here. -/

/-- **`AbsentImtGatesOn`** — the deployed `Ir2Air::MapAbsent` acceptance for ONE row, at the padded
arity-3 commitment. The path is `MA_LO_SIB0`/`MA_LO_DIR0`, the leaf is `HeapLeaf::digest8`, the
bracket is `MA_CMP_LO0`/`MA_CMP_HI0` over the canonical lifts, and `newRoot = oldRoot` is the lane
equality the absent table (unlike `MapOps`) really does write. -/

The `.insert` arm is judged by the shape that ships. The committed POST-heap rides in the SAME
knowledge-extraction slot `ReconcileGatesAt`'s `∃ h, Heap.SortedKeys h` occupies — same species, no
new floor. Every other kind is left EXACTLY as it was, so this composes additively with
`MapReconcileImtRepoint`'s `.absent` repoint and the arity-2 arm stays available for the future model
in which the AIR really does fold a chain to the pre-root. -/

/-- **`InsertRowImtAt`** — the deployed op = 3 acceptance AT THE ROW'S COLUMNS. `MAP_NEXT` is a real
deployed column but `MapOp` has no field for it, so it rides existentially, exactly as
`ReconcileGatesAt`'s `vOld` does. ⚑ Note the absent parameter: the row's PRE-root column
(`m.root 0`) does not appear, because the AIR does not constrain it. -/

/-! ## §4 — THE ROW VEHICLE AND THE FIRST FRESH-KEY `.insert` EXHIBIT, AT `MAP_TREE_DEPTH = 16`.

The epoch has never had one. `MapOpsColumnLayout.toy_insert_op_value_update_gates` (renamed this
session) writes key `20` into a heap that HOLDS key `20`; at the arity-2 model no fresh-key witness
exists at all (`reconcileGates_insert_unsat_at_fresh_key`). Here is the real thing, on the deployed
shape at the deployed depth over the SPARSE occupancy `CanonicalHeapTree8::new` builds: one live
leaf `(1,7)` in a `2^16`-leaf commitment, key `5` FRESH, appended at the first padding slot.

Everything is reused rather than rebuilt: `MapKindImtGates`'s `biteHeap` / `biteSteps`
(`leftPadPath`) / `aafiSteps2` (`slot1Path`) / `aafiNewRoot`. No `2^16` object is ever constructed;
every root is NAMED as the schema's own `commit`. -/

refuted by TWO independent mechanisms, as it was there. -/

section Incomparable

/-- **★ MECHANISM A — THE COMMITMENT.** On the honest deployed row the OLD model has no witness at
all: its extraction premise demands `mapRoot hash 16 h = MAP_ROOT` and the deployed pre-root column
is the padded arity-3 commitment, which §1 proves is never an arity-2 `mapRoot`. Note what this does
NOT need: no assumption about the key, the map's contents, or even the op kind. -/

/-- **★ MECHANISM B — THE FRESH KEY**, in the COUNTERFACTUAL arity-2 world, at the DEPLOYED depth.
Even where the arity-2 commitment is the one in play, the model's `.insert` arm demands an old-leaf
path to the pre-root, hence the key ALREADY COMMITTED — and the deployed builder refuses exactly
those rows. Stated over the epoch's own `spineC` spine at `MAP_TREE_DEPTH`, whose terminal gap holds
every fresh key: nothing is enumerated. -/

demands a padded arity-3 one. So the arity-2 arm is not a special case of the deployed arm either. -/

/-! ## §6 — ⚑⚑ THE HONEST LIMIT: THE PAIRING IS A FIRST-CLASS OBJECT, AND IT IS **NOT ENOUGH**.

`descriptor_ir2.rs:540-542` names the deployed fix in prose: *"Freshness must be established
separately, e.g. by a paired `MapKind::Absent` opening against the same pre-root."* Model that
composition and ask what it forces. It forces FRESHNESS-THEN-PRESENCE. It does NOT force the write
denotation — and that is a REFUTATION at the deployed depth, not a gap.

The reason is structural and survives any amount of Lean: the `.absent` row constrains the PRE-root
only, the op = 3 row constrains the POST-root only, and NOTHING relates them. A prover may therefore
answer an honest freshness check about one map and then commit an entirely different map. -/

/-- **`insertsFreshS`** — what the deployed `.absent` + `.insert` PAIR actually denotes: the key was
ABSENT under the pre-root and is PRESENT at the written value under the post-root. This is the
composition object, named. It is strictly weaker than `writesToMerkleS`, which additionally says the
post-map is the pre-map with exactly that one entry changed. -/

/-- **`InsertPairRowAt`** — the pairing the deployment names, as ONE object: a deployed
`Ir2Air::MapAbsent` row against the pre-root (root-preserving, per that table's lane equality) and a
deployed op = 3 row against the post-root, at the SAME padded commitment. ⚠ NOTE WHAT IS MISSING AND
IS ALSO MISSING FROM THE DEPLOYMENT: nothing here — and nothing in the AIR — checks that the two rows
are on the same turn, in the same order, or present at all. -/

/-! ## §7 — ⚑⚑ THE TENTH IMPOSSIBILITY: A SINGLE-PATH ROW CANNOT DENOTE AN INTERIOR SORTED INSERT.

§6 leaves an obvious repair on the table: add to op = 3 the AAFI-style gate (d1) — *"the free slot
was EMPTY under the pre-root"* — folding `padDigest` up the SAME `MAP_SIB0`/`MAP_DIR0` path that
already carries the new leaf. That would relate the pre-root to the post-root, so it looks like it
closes the erasure. It does not, and the obstruction is structural, not cryptographic.

Any gate set built on the ONE deployed sibling path produces a post-vector of the form
`(padVec … pre).set p x` — that is literally `padOpen_binds_or_resid`'s update clause. But
`heap_root.rs::insert_witness` (`:1087-1121`) splices the fresh leaf into its SORTED position and
rebuilds a COMPACTED tree, so at an interior key the post-vector differs from the pre-vector in the
predecessor's POINTER, in the new cell, and in every shifted cell — three positions, not one.

Consequence: **op = 3 cannot be repaired into soundness on its own shape.** The two-path AAFI op is
not an optimisation of `.insert`; it is the only shape in which a fresh-key insert is expressible at
stable positions. `descriptor_ir2.rs:545-547` reached the same verdict in prose (*"no shared
pre-image binds the shifted suffix"*); this is that sentence as a theorem. -/

/-! ## §8 — ⚑⚑ THE THIRD HOST, AND IT IS THE LIVE ONE: `.aafiInsert`.

Read `MapOpsColumnLayout.ReconcileGatesAt` at lines 825-842. The `.write`, `.insert` AND
`.aafiInsert` arms are **the same body, character for character** — one shared path, an old leaf at
`(key, vOld)` folding to the PRE-root, a new leaf folding to the post-root. So
`reconcileGates_insert_forces_key_present` was never about `.insert`: it is about that body, and the
body sits on three arms.

Which arm does the prover actually run? Not `.insert`. The two literal `op := .insert` MapOps in the
emit tree — `EffectVmEmitRotationV3.insertWriteOp` (`:1445`) and `insertWriteOpRot` (`:1925`) — are
**ORPHANS**: no descriptor's `constraints` list contains `.mapOp insertWriteOp` or
`.mapOp insertWriteOpRot` anywhere in the tree. ⚠ THIS CORRECTS `MapAbsentImtGate`'s header
(`:71-73`), which says *"the two surviving op=3 `.insert`s (`insertWriteOp`, `insertWriteOpRot`)
write only `cap_root`"* — they write nothing, because nothing declares them.

What IS wired is `.aafiInsert`: `nullifierInsertOp` (`:2387-2393`, in `noteSpendV3.constraints` at
`:2437`), `commitmentsInsertOp` (`:2648`), `revokedInsertOp` (`:2748`), `cellsInsertOp` (`:2875`).
And every one of those rows has a FRESH key by construction — `heap_root.rs::insert_witness_aafi`
returns `None` when the key is already present (guard at `:1167`, documented at `:1154-1155`),
which is the whole point of the double-spend bracket. So the model's hypothesis is FALSE on every AAFI row the prover emits, for the
same reason and by the same proof.

⚑ **The `.insert` finding's practical weight is therefore on `.aafiInsert`**: it is not a dormant
arm's defect, it is the accumulator arm — nullifiers, commitments, revocations, cells — running on a
premise no honest trace satisfies. -/

/-- The arity-2 model's `.aafiInsert` arm FORCES the row's key into the committed pre-heap — the
same proof as the `.insert` one, because it is the same body. -/

/-- **★★ THE ARITY-2 MODEL HAS NO WITNESS ON A DEPLOYED AAFI INSERT ROW.** `insert_witness_aafi`
refuses a key that is already present, so every emitted `nullifierInsertOp` / `commitmentsInsertOp` /
`revokedInsertOp` / `cellsInsertOp` row carries a FRESH key — and at a fresh key the model's premise
is FALSE. This is `reconcileGates_insert_unsat_at_fresh_key` on the arm that actually ships. -/

/-! ## §9 — THE BLAST RADIUS: what rested on the arity-2 `.insert` model.

Everything below has the write-shaped arity-2 body (`.write` / `.insert` / `.aafiInsert` — §8: one
body, three arms) as a HYPOTHESIS at a FRESH key, so on every honest deployed insert / AAFI row that
hypothesis is FALSE and the statement is vacuous exactly where the prover operates. This is the same
list `MapAbsentImtGate`'s §5 produced for `.absent`; it is what tells the next lane what to trust.

**(A) SPECIALIZED to `MapOpKind.insert` — fully vacuous on deployed rows.**
`MapOpWideKeyWeld.gates_force_holdsKindW_insert` (`:305`), `.gates_insertW_absentW_jointly_unsat`
(`:339`), `.gates_jointly_unsat_via_abstract'` (`:370`), `.demoInsert_then_absent_unsat` (`:473`),
`.demoInsert_then_absent_unsat_via_abstract` (`:481`);
`MapOpWideKeyRowBoundary.gates_force_holdsKindW_insert_row` (`:333`),
`.gates_insertW_absentW_jointly_unsat_row` (`:376`), `.gates_jointly_unsat_via_abstract_row'`
(`:399`), `.demoRow_insert_then_absent_unsat` (`:762`), `.…_via_abstract` (`:774`);
`MapOpWideKeyGate.insertW_absentW_jointly_unsat'` (`:928`); `MapOpWideKey.insertW_sound` (`:409`),
`.insertW_then_absentW_unsat` (`:432`).
⚠ **CORRECTED 2026-07-26 (`MapAafiLiveRepoint` §10).** This paragraph read *"NINE of these are
registered keystones in `Dregg2/Verify/FloorRatchetBaseline.lean` (`:941`, `:942`, `:945`, `:973`,
`:984`, `:985`, `:988`, `:2042`, `:2046`) — so the vacuity is load-bearing in the assurance case"*.
Three things were wrong. (i) `FloorRatchetBaseline` is NOT a keystone registry: its header says every
name there *"is a declaration whose type takes a hypothesis this tree PROVES FALSE at deployed
BabyBear parameters, so the declaration is VACUOUS"* — registration is a recorded ADMISSION, not a
claim. (ii) The keystone instrument is `Verify/KeystoneLint`'s `@[load_bearing_keystone]` +
`#keystone_audit`, and ZERO of these names carry it. (iii) The line numbers: one of the nine
(`:941`) lands on a name this list discusses, `:945`/`:973` are the `.read` legs this list itself
calls SOUND, `:984`/`:988` are group B, `:2042`/`:2046` are in unrelated modules. The real count is
**TEN**, at `:940`, `:941`, `:944`, `:965`, `:966`, `:972`, `:2066`, `:2068`, `:2070`, `:2072`, and
each is adjudicated by name in `MapAafiLiveRepoint` §10. ⚑ The corrected finding is SHARPER, not
softer: the premise vacuity is invisible to the floor ratchet (which sees only the refuted
`Poseidon2SpongeCR`), invisible to `#keystone_audit`, and invisible to the preflight — it is
UNDETECTED, not load-bearing. And a baseline line for a LIVE carrier must not be deleted:
`FloorRatchet.check` errors on any carrier absent from the baseline.

**(A′) THE SAME, on the LIVE `.aafiInsert` arm (§8).** `MapOpWideKeyWeld.gates_force_holdsKindW_aafiInsert`
(`:313`), `.gates_aafiInsertW_absentW_jointly_unsat` (`:348`), `.gates_jointly_unsat_via_abstract`
(`:361`); `MapOpWideKeyRowBoundary.gates_force_holdsKindW_aafiInsert_row` (`:340`),
`.gates_aafiInsertW_absentW_jointly_unsat_row` (`:387`), `.gates_jointly_unsat_via_abstract_row`
(`:409`); `MapOpWideKeyGate.insertW_absentW_jointly_unsat` (`:921`); `MapOpWideKey.aafiInsertW_sound`
(`:419`). ⚠ These are the ones that BITE: their rows are emitted.
(`MapOpsColumnLayout.AafiGatesAt` / `MapOpWideKeyGate.AafiGatesAtW` / `aafiInsert_forces_imtInsert`
are a SEPARATE two-path model and are NOT affected.)

**(B) GENERIC over all five kinds — sound on `.read`/`.absent`, vacuous on the write-shaped legs.**
`MapOpsColumnLayout.reconcileGates_force_opening` (`:847`), `.mapOp_holds_of_mapReconcile` (`:900`),
`.MapReconcileModelOk` (`:912`), `.mapOpsArm_of_modeler` (`:922`),
`.hbus_of_busModels_and_mapModel` (`:937`), `.airAccept_forces_satisfied2_of_modelers` (`:974`);
`MapOpWideKeyGate.reconcileGatesW_force_openingW` (`:557`), `.mapOpW_gates_force_holds` (`:658`),
and the two `Iff.rfl` transports `.narrow_gates_is_instance` (`:635`) / `.narrow_holdsAt_is_instance`
(`:625`) that land the defect on BOTH models at once;
`MapOpWideKeyRowBoundary.mapOpW_gatesCanon_force_holdsCanon` (`:349`);
`DescriptorIR2.MapOp.holdsAt` (`:577`) and `MapDenotationSchema.MapOp.holdsAtS` (`:196`);
`DecideMapMerkle.mapDecMerkle` (`:128`) and its `_sound` / `_complete` / `_faithful` /
`decideSatisfied2'_iff_Satisfied2` / `instDecidableSatisfied2'` (`:149`, `:200`, `:269`, `:290`,
`:302`) — note `decWritesTo` decides `h.length = 2^16 ∧ (Heap.set h k v).length = 2^16`, which a
FRESH key makes unsatisfiable outright;
`AlgoStarkSoundFanoutMemory.MapReconcileFamily` (`:119`), `.memoryLegs_of_mapShape` (`:218`),
`.algoStarkSound_of_mapShape` (`:266`), `.…_noOodShape` (`:581`), and the per-effect apexes
`algoStarkSound_noteSpend` / `_noteCreate` / `_createCell` / `_createCellFromFactory` / `_spawn` /
`_spawnWrite` (`:388`, `:405`, `:422`, `:439`, `:456`, `:474`) — each fires an `.aafiInsert` row.
⚠ `algoStarkSound_refusal` (`:491`) and `_heapWrite` (`:509`) are CLEAN: their map ops are `.write`
at keys the row's own gate holds present.
`MapReconcileImtRepoint.ReconcileGatesImtAt` (`:256`) and `.mapOpsArmImt_of_modeler` (`:349`) inherit
it too — that repoint fixed `.absent` ONLY, and routes every other kind to the broken arm (`:265`).

**(C) EXHIBITS that instantiate a write-shaped row and were read as insert evidence.**
`MapOpsColumnLayout.toy_insert_op_value_update_gates` / `_fires` / `toy_frozen_insert_bites` (renamed
and restated this session) — key `20`, which `toyHeap` HOLDS.
⚑ AND THE WIDE TWIN HAS THE SAME BLIND SPOT, unflagged until now:
`MapOpWideKeyWeld.demoInsertGateW_accepts` (`:454`) ran `MapOpKind.insert` over
`demoHeapW = [(keyLo,1),(keyHi,2)] → demoHeapW2 = [(keyLo,5),(keyHi,2)]` — `keyLo` is ALREADY in the
heap and the two heaps have the SAME length. It is a value update at the wide key, and it is what
feeds `demoRow_insert_then_absent_unsat` (a floor-ratchet baseline entry, not a keystone — see the
correction above). ⚑ FIXED 2026-07-26: RENAMED `demoValueUpdateGateW_accepts`, with
`demoValueUpdateGateW_key_is_already_committed` promoted to a theorem beside it, and
`MapAafiLiveRepoint.wide_insert_never_grows_the_map` proves FLOOR-FREE that a fresh-key twin cannot
be written at any `LaneEnc` or depth. The `.insert` teeth have never been exercised on an insert, at
either key width, and at the wide width they never can be.

⚠ NOT in the blast radius, and this is the point of the repoint: `insertImtRow_post_opens_of_good`,
`MapOpImtInsertHoldsAt`, §4's fresh-key exhibits and §6's composition are stated over the deployed
shape and hold on exactly the rows the prover emits. -/
