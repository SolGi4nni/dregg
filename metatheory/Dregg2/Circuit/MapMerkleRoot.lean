# Dregg2.Circuit.MapMerkleRoot — the DEPLOYED depth-16 binary-Merkle map root (the faithful map-op commitment).

## What this closes (deliverable 2 — the last real denotation gap)

`DescriptorIR2.opensTo`/`writesTo` (the `MapOp.holdsAt` legs for nullifiers / cells / commitments)
denoted a FLAT SPONGE `Dregg2.Substrate.Heap.root hash h = hash (h.map leafOf)` — a single sponge over
the sorted leaf list. The DEPLOYED map-op (`circuit/src/heap_root.rs`, `circuit/src/descriptor_ir2.rs`
`Ir2Air::MapOps`) commits a **depth-`d` BINARY MERKLE** root instead:

    leaf = hash[addr, value]                       -- ⚠ the PRE-IMT leaf (see below)
    node = hash[left, right]                       -- arity-2 `hash_fact(l, [r])` (the `mix` fold)
    root = the perfect binary fold of the (padded) sorted leaf-digest list, depth `HEAP_TREE_DEPTH = 16`

⚠ ARITY NOTE (gap-#5 IMT, 2026-07): the DEPLOYED `HeapLeaf::digest`/`digest8` is now the LINKED
arity-3 `hash[addr, value, next_addr]` (`IndexedMerkleTree.imtLeafHash`). The FAITHFUL 8-felt §5b
section below models exactly that (`linkHeap` + the arity-3 `heapLeafDigest8`). The SCALAR §2-§5
model in THIS section still folds the historical arity-2 `leafOf` — it is the lane-0/1-felt
DENOTATION layer (`DescriptorIR2.opensTo`/`writesTo`), a NAMED residue of the IMT cutover: its
`writesTo` describes the pre-IMT leaf function, pending the denotation rewire onto `ImtLeaf`.

This module models EXACTLY that binary fold (`mapNode`/`foldLevel`/`perfectRoot`) and proves it
INJECTIVE on the padded leaf-digest vector under the single named Poseidon2-CR floor
(`mapNode_injective` — the `hash[l,r]` 2-to-1 node CR — composed up the depth-`d` perfect tree by
`perfectRoot_injective`). `DescriptorIR2` re-defines `opensTo`/`writesTo` over THIS root (dropping the
flat-sponge `Heap.root`), so `MapOp.holdsAt` — a leg of the deployed `Satisfied2` — denotes the genuine
depth-16 binary-Merkle opening, and the anti-ghost `opensTo_functional`/`writesTo_functional` re-prove
against `perfectRoot_injective` (the binary-tree analog of `Heap.root_injective`), NOT the sponge.

## The model (faithful to `heap_root.rs`)

The deployed `CanonicalHeapTree` pads the sorted leaf list to `2^d` positions with the MIN/MAX
sentinels, then folds bottom-up by `hash_fact(l, [r])`. We model the COMMITMENT of a sorted heap as
`mapRoot hash h := perfectRoot hash d (padDigests d (h.map (leafOf hash)))`: the leaf digests of the
sorted entries, padded to `2^d` with a fixed sentinel digest, folded up the perfect tree. The sorted
discipline (`SortedKeys`) keeps the entry list canonical, so the heap MEANING (`Heap.get`) is unchanged
— only the COMMITMENT FUNCTION moves from the flat sponge to the binary fold. The named CR floor is the
SAME `Poseidon2SpongeCR`, now used at the 2-to-1 node (`mapNode`) and the leaf (`leafOf`).

## ⚑ The exported §5b binding is a REDUCTION on the keyed-ROM floor (07-24)

The §5b `…_binds_or_collides` forms are DEMOTED to exact-Prop skeletons: a bare
`binds ∨ Coll8 (extracted pair)` quantifies over SOLUTIONS, and at deployed BabyBear parameters a
chip collision EXISTS by pigeonhole (`VacuitySweepTeeth.compress8CR_false_babyBear`), so each
disjunction is satisfiable through the collides branch with `binds` never holding.  Cryptographic
hardness quantifies over EFFICIENT ADVERSARIES.  The exported binding of the depth-`d` heap tree
is §RomSuccessor's `heapTreeRoot_binds_rom`: the whole-tree equivocation is a first-class
`RomForgery` at a SAMPLED role-keyed oracle, the extractor RE-WALKS both trees as an oracle
program (`heapFindComp`, `2^(d+2) − 2` queries, additive accounting), and the floor is
`KeyedRomFloor.keyedRom_hard` — the birthday bound, a THEOREM.  The skeletons are RETAINED (not
deleted) because `Deos.DocSubstrateSound` still consumes them one layer up (its two composition
theorems are the next repoint site of this class); the reduction consumes NONE of them.

## Axiom hygiene

`#assert_axioms` ⊆ {propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}. Crypto
enters ONLY as the named `Poseidon2SpongeCR` floor (at the node + leaf), the SAME floor the whole
commitment tower carries — and, in §RomSuccessor, as the PROVED keyed-ROM floor.

`perfectRoot_injective` used to peel the `d` levels with `Poseidon2SpongeCR`, which
`HashFloorHonesty.poseidon2SpongeCR_false_babyBear` PROVES FALSE for every BabyBear-bounded sponge.
So at deployed parameters it said nothing. This section restates the SAME induction with the floor
REMOVED: where the old proof fed an equal-digest pair to the (false) injectivity, this one RETURNS
that pair. The 8-felt half of this file already worked this way (`foldLevel8Find`/`perfectRoot8Find`,
§5b); the ℤ half did not, and every widened map-root consumer routes through it.

`mapRoot_binds_or_collides`, and the three `opensToMerkle`/`writesToMerkle` anti-ghost teeth from

`Poseidon2SpongeCR hash` and peel the `d` levels with it; that premise is FALSE at deployed BabyBear
(`HashFloorHonesty.poseidon2SpongeCR_false_babyBear`), so the theorem was VACUOUS exactly where the

It now assumes the DECIDABLE per-instance residual at the ONE pair `perfectRootFind` hands back for
these two vectors. Strictly weaker than the floor (`perfectRootColl_refutes_poseidon2CR`),
dischargeable by anyone who can evaluate the sponge on two ≤2-felt lists
(`perfectRootColl_dischargeable`), and — unlike the floor — SATISFIABLE at deployed parameters.

/-! ## §4 — `mapRoot`: the ARITY-2 map COMMITMENT (the binary fold of the sorted heap's leaf digests).

⚠ This section was titled "the deployed map COMMITMENT". It is not: since 2026-07-12 the deployed tree
folds ARITY-3 IMT leaves over a sparse padded vector — see `mapRoot`'s doc-comment below for the full
correction and the pointer to `MapPaddedDenotation.padImtRoot`.

The sorted heap (`Heap.FeltHeap`, the abstract map MEANING) is committed by folding its leaf-digest list
through the depth-`d` perfect binary tree. The heap MEANING
(`Heap.get`/`Heap.SortedKeys`) is UNCHANGED; only the COMMITMENT FUNCTION moves from the flat sponge
(`Heap.root hash h = hash (h.map leafOf)`) to this binary fold. The deployment pins every heap as the
fixed-depth `2^d`-leaf padded vector; the `RootedAt` relation below carries that `length = 2^d`
discipline so the root BINDS the heap (`mapRoot_injective`). -/

/-- **`mapRoot hash d h`** — the depth-`d` binary-Merkle root of the sorted heap `h`: the perfect-tree
fold of its leaf-digest list `h.map (Heap.leafOf hash)`.

⚠ **THIS DOC-COMMENT CLAIMED "BYTE-IDENTICAL to `heap_root.rs`'s `CanonicalHeapTree::root` (arity-2
`leafOf` leaves…)" AND THAT IS FALSE AT HEAD.** It was true when written and stopped being true on
2026-07-12 (`919b2b0b8d`): `CanonicalHeapTree` became an INDEXED Merkle tree whose leaf is
`hash[addr, value, next_addr]` (`HeapLeaf::preimage`, `HEAP_LEAF_ARITY = 3`, arity 2 → 3 with the
successor pointer inside the digest) over a SPARSE zero-padded `2^d` vector with ONE stored sentinel
(`HEAP_SENTINEL_LEAVES = 1`). Under the CR floor an arity-3 IMT root is NEVER an arity-2 `mapRoot`
(`MapReconcileImtRepoint.imtRoot_ne_mapRoot`), so this is not a drifted constant — it is a DIFFERENT
COMMITMENT over the same logical map. A byte-identity claim to a Rust object is exactly the kind of
claim that must be re-read when that object moves.

`mapRoot` itself is unchanged and still correct as the arity-2 model fold; the DEPLOYED commitment is
`MapPaddedDenotation.padImtRoot sent` (schema `padImtSchema sent`, teeth `padImtTeeth sent`), and the
NODE fold `mapNode` is still shared. Everything below is about `mapRoot`; nothing below should be quoted
as being about `heap_root`. -/

/-! ### §4a — THE MAP-ROOT EXTRACTOR and the floor-free binding.

⚑ These two lived in `MapPaddedDenotation` §4c (added there to feed `narrowTeeth`) while
`mapRoot_injective` — one level UP, in this file — still peeled the tree with the refuted floor. That
is the shape the ⚑07-28 sweep was looking for: the cure existed, downstream of the wound, and the
wound was never rewired onto it. They are MOVED here, at the definition of `mapRoot`, and
`MapPaddedDenotation` now `open`s them. Same statements, same proofs, one home. -/

/-- **THE MAP-ROOT EXTRACTOR** — the SINGLE named pair the whole arity-2 heap-root peel hands back.
Run the perfect-tree descent over the two leaf-digest vectors; if it found a genuine collision that
is the answer, otherwise the descent has already forced the two DIGEST VECTORS equal, so the
collision (if any) is at the LEAF absorb and `Heap.mapLeafFind` supplies the pair. Total, decidable,
and independent of anything assumed about `hash`. -/

/-- **⚑ `mapRoot_injective`, PORTED OFF THE REFUTED FLOOR (2026-07-28) — the anti-ghost the DEPLOYED
map-op denotation terminates in.** It assumed `Poseidon2SpongeCR hash`, PROVED FALSE at deployed
BabyBear (`HashFloorHonesty.poseidon2SpongeCR_false_babyBear`), so `DescriptorIR2.opensTo_functional`
/ `writesTo_functional` — the deployed map-op anti-ghost — bottomed out, at their final step, in a
VACUOUS theorem. Its CONCLUSION was empty there too: `2 ^ 16` entries of `ℤ × ℤ` into one BabyBear
felt collide by the same pigeonhole that refutes the premise.

It now assumes the DECIDABLE per-instance residual at the ONE pair `mapRootFind` hands back for these
two heaps. Strictly weaker than the floor (`mapRootSpongeColl_refutes_poseidon2CR`), dischargeable
(`mapRootSpongeColl_dischargeable`), refutable (`mapRootSpongeColl_refutable`), and SATISFIABLE at deployed
parameters where the floor is not.

⚑ HONEST PRICE, stated at the resolution the deployment actually has: this is a ONE-FELT commitment
(`mapNode hash [l, r] : ℤ`, `Heap.leafOf hash [a, v] : ℤ`), so the residual costs a collision search
on a single BabyBear felt — **≈2^15.5 queries, which is a BREAK**, not a security level. The 8-felt
twin (`§5b`'s `mapRoot8` / `MapRootSpongeColl` at `Digest8`) is the ~2^123.5 object. Porting the floor off
does not make the arity-2 model safe; it makes the price VISIBLE instead of assumed away.

longer any CR floor at all. -/

/-! ### §5a — THE OPENING-LEVEL RESIDUAL, at the heaps the two openings ACTUALLY SUPPLY.

⚑ The three teeth below quantify over OPENINGS, not over heaps: `opensToMerkle` hides its witness
behind an `∃`. That is why they could not simply inherit `§4a`'s per-instance residual, and it is
also why no `∀ h₁ h₂, ¬ MapRootSpongeColl …` side condition would do — at a fixed root the set of heaps
with that root is INFINITE, so a `∀`-shaped residual is refuted by exactly the pigeonhole that
refutes the floor. (`MapPaddedDenotation`'s schema-level teeth took the other road: they expose the
witness heaps as arguments. `opensToMerkleS_functional_of_good` then needs `Good hash`, which at
`narrowTeeth` is `Function.Injective hash` — **definitionally `Poseidon2SpongeCR hash`**, i.e. the
same refuted floor under another name. So that road does not reach the deployed statement either.)

What does reach it: NAME the two heaps. `Exists.choose` is canonical here — proof irrelevance makes
`h.choose` a function of the PROPOSITION `opensToMerkle hash d r k o`, not of the proof term — so
`OpenColl` is the collision at the ONE pair `mapRootFind` returns for the two heaps these two
openings supply, and nothing wider. -/

/-! ## §5b — THE FAITHFUL 8-felt map denotation (Phase H-HEAP-8): the perfect-tree fold + opening over
`node8` (`Digest8`), the exact twin of §2–§5 but at the deployed ~124-bit width. The historical §2–§5
folded a SINGLE felt per node (`mapNode hash : ℤ → ℤ → ℤ`, ~2^31, below the FRI/STARK ~124-bit floor); the
GENTIAN tooth exhibits a colliding-lane-0 heap pair. This section commits the FULL 8-felt root: nodes ride
`Heap8Scheme.heapNodeOf8` (arity-16 `node8` chip) and leaves `heapLeafDigest8` (`DeployedHeapTree`), NOT
the 1-felt sponge. `MapOp.holdsAt`'s deployed denotation moves onto `opensToMerkle8` / `writesToMerkle8`.

⚑ **BINDING IS EXTRACTED AS DATA, NOT ASSUMED (2026-07-20).** This cascade used to be discharged from
`heapNodeOf8_injective` / `heapLeafDigest8_injective`, which rode the `Heap8Scheme.chip8CR` FIELD —
`Compress8CR chipAbsorb8`, which the deployed chip REFUTES (`VacuitySweepTeeth.compress8CR_false_babyBear`)
and which therefore made `Heap8Scheme` uninhabitable and this whole section VACUOUS. The field is deleted;
every equality below is now a DISJUNCTION `binding ∨ Coll8 chipAbsorb8 (the pair a TOTAL extractor
returned)`. The extractors mirror the proofs exactly: `foldLevel8Find` scans one Merkle level pairwise,
`perfectRoot8Find` descends the levels, `mapLeaf8Find` scans the leaf vector, and `mapRoot8Find` resolves
the two possible collision sites (node vs leaf) into ONE named pair. §5b.S recovers every deleted
statement as the injective special case, so no strength was lost. -/

produces a full ~124-bit collision at a NAMED pair of chip input blocks. The old form asserted the

extractor returns is a function of the WITNESSES, not of the statement's visible parameters. Restating
the conclusion as `… ∨ ∃ collision` would be exactly the free pass this repair exists to avoid
(pigeonhole makes it unconditionally true). So the honest form takes the two witness heaps EXPLICITLY
and names `MapRootColl S8 d m₁ m₂` — the specific pair, extracted from the specific witnesses. The
existential-level statements survive as the injective special cases in §5b.S. -/

The `…_of_injective` bridges assume exactly the injectivity the deleted `Heap8Scheme.chip8CR` field
asserted, and EVERY deleted statement — including the existential-level `opensToMerkle8_functional`,
`opensToMerkle8_some_excludes_none` and `writesToMerkle8_functional` — falls straight out. They are
precisely the injective special case of the new disjunctions. And `mapRootColl_refutable_of_injective`
shows the collision disjunct is REFUTABLE, so it is not a free pass: at an injective chip the binding
half has to do the work.

These are STANDALONE bridges, deliberately NOT hypotheses on any deployed keystone: `Compress8CR` is
FALSE at deployed BabyBear parameters, so a keystone carrying it would be right back where this repair
started. -/

/-! ## ⚑ §RomSuccessor — the depth-`d` tree binding, DISCHARGED on the PROVED keyed-ROM floor.

⚑ **THE MODELLING STEP, STATED (not smuggled)**, the `RomCarrierSites` discipline:

  * the sampled `H : Role × Msg → Fin (2 ^ l)` idealises the deployed arity-16 `node8` chip at an
    ASYMPTOTIC digest width — there is NO `l` at which `Fin (2 ^ l)` is the deployed 8-felt
    (~124-bit) digest;
  * the message domain is the TRUNCATED deployed absorb schedule: the linked arity-3 IMT leaf
    block `(addr, value, next)` at BabyBear range (`HeapLeaf::digest8`), and the two-child node
    block (a pair of digests — `heap_root.rs`'s `hash_fact(l, [r])` fold node), domain-separated
    by the ROLE key where the deployed chip separates by absorb arity (3 vs 16 felts);
  * the tree SHAPE is the deployed one: the bottom-up adjacent-pair fold of `perfectRoot8` IS the
    top-down contiguous-halves recursion `romFold` (level-`k` node `j` covers leaves
    `j·2^k … (j+1)·2^k − 1` in both presentations).

The forger equivocates the WHOLE `2^d`-leaf tree; the extractor RE-WALKS both trees as an oracle
program (`heapFindComp` — the ROM successor of the total extractor `mapRoot8Find`), paying
`2^(d+2) − 2` queries with ADDITIVE accounting, and names the shallowest layer at which the two
trees' absorbed blocks differ.  Every case is a win of ONE carrier at the sampled oracle;
`romCarrier_binds` (hence `keyedRom_hard`, the birthday bound) kills it.  What this section does
NOT carry: the ℤ-heap range bridge (`linkHeap` payloads are in-range felts on every deployed
heap) stays at the fixed-hash layer above — the ROM payload is the truncated linked-leaf
schedule itself. -/
