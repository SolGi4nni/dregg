# Dregg2.Circuit.MapOpWideKey — the WIDE-KEY map-op IR node (`MapOpW`), and the weld that makes
  the felt-width **kind-D** class widenable producer-side.

## The root cause this file addresses

`Dregg2/Circuit/DescriptorIR2.lean:301-313` types a `MapOp` with 8-felt `root` / `newRoot` groups
but a **scalar `key : EmittedExpr`**. That one line is why every kind-D felt-width site (wound
`docs/WOUND-felt-width-boundaries-2026-07-19.md` #5 / #9 / #11 / #20) is un-widenable *producer
side*: the producer physically cannot hand 8 felts to a 1-felt column. This file authors the
widened IR node **beside** the deployed one — `MapOpW` with `key : Fin 8 → EmittedExpr` — and
proves the soundness of its `.absent` / `.insert` legs by COMPOSING the already-landed Wide8
machinery, plus the one weld nothing had yet: the emitted lex-8 compare gadget bolted to the
widened pointer-bracket keystone.

## What was already proven (COMPOSED here, never re-derived)

  * `Crypto/Digest8KeySpike.lean` — `Digest8Key := Lex (Fin 8 → ℤ)` with its `LinearOrder`;
    `sorted_gap_excludes_digest8`, `imtAbsent_excludes_digest8`, `imtInsert_preserves_digest8`.
  * `Circuit/SortedTreeNonMembershipWide8.lean` — the `[LinearOrder K]`-generic non-membership
    wrapper (`SpineCommitsW`/`keysOfW`/`GapOpenW`/`nonMembership_soundW`) at `K := Digest8Key`,
    plus the `proj0` security delta.
  * `Circuit/SortedTreeInsertWide8.lean` — the insert side (`sortedInsertW`/`update_soundW`/
    `insert_then_no_nonmembershipW`) and the insert/exclude duality.
  * `Circuit/Emit/LexCompare8Emit.lean` — `lexLt8Descriptor` + `lexLt8_refines`: the EMITTED AIR
    block deciding `toLex a < toLex b` over canonical 8-felt keys, as a proven iff.

## What is genuinely NEW here

  1. **`MapOpW`** — the widened IR node, and `MapOpW.narrow` : the DEPLOYED `MapOp` is EXACTLY its
     lane-0 projection (`narrow_key_is_lane0`, `rfl`). So the widening is a conservative extension,
     not a parallel universe, and the wire cost is a theorem (`rowAt` 19 → 26 felts, leaf arity
     3 → 17).
  2. **The weld** `absentBracket_of_lexBlocks` — two satisfied `lexLt8` blocks (`low.addr < k` and
     `k < low.next`, both at the FULL 8-felt lex order) plus a committed low leaf FORCE
     `k ∉ imtAddrs c`. This is the first place the emitted compare gadget and the widened
     bracketing keystone touch; it is what a widened `MapKind::Absent` AIR row means. Its
     completeness twin `absentBracket_realizable` says an honest bracket ADMITS those blocks (the
     gate is not a DoS).
  3. **The wide IMT leaf** `imtLeafHash8` (arity 17 = 8 addr ‖ value ‖ 8 next) with
     `imtLeafHash8_injective` under the SAME named `Poseidon2SpongeCR` floor, and the
     anti-launder tooth `narrowLeaf_conflates` / `wideLeaf_separates`: pre-folding the 8-felt
     address to lane 0 and THEN hashing still conflates two distinct keys (the
     `finalSqueezeOnly_still_conflates` shape, at the map leaf).
  4. **Wound #20's prose argument, machine-checked in BOTH directions.**
     `narrow_only_over_revokes`: a same-projection-keyed `.absent` op can only OVER-include, so a
     lane-0 collision is NOT a soundness break — the wound's claim, now a theorem, not a paragraph.
     `narrowAbsent_unprovable`: and yet the SAME collision makes the honest, genuinely-fresh key
     PERMANENTLY unprovable at the narrow key — the availability break, also a theorem.
     `wideAbsent_provable`: at the wide key the same query goes through. `dosDelta_site20`
     packages the three.

## Honest scope (residuals, NOT closed here)

  * The `Opens` predicate is left ABSTRACT (same discipline as the Wide8 wrappers): the realizing
    widened chip row — an arity-17 leaf absorb + two `lexLt8` blocks per bracket — is the Rust
    re-emit, and it is a **VK epoch**. Nothing deployed is touched by this file.
  * The map-op VALUE stays one felt. Value widening is a separate named residual (#4/#10).
  * `MapOpW` is not registered in any descriptor, not emitted, and has no JSON face: adding one
    is the cutover commit, deliberately not here.
  * The `.write` leg (an in-place value update at an EXISTING key, keyed by `heap_addr(coll,key)`)
    is not part of the kind-D class and is intentionally `True` in the widened denotation.

## Axiom hygiene
`#assert_axioms` ⊆ {propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}. Crypto enters ONLY as the named
`Poseidon2SpongeCR` floor. NEW file; every import read-only; no `sorry`/`admit`/`native_decide`.
Heap safety: all concrete objects are literal 8-element lists / 1-3-element chains.

`EmittedExpr` to `Fin 8 → EmittedExpr`. The map-op VALUE stays one felt (named residual). -/

/-- **The deployed key IS lane 0 of the widened key.** So `MapOpW` is a conservative extension of
the deployed IR node — the whole kind-D class is "read the other seven lanes", not a new object.
This is the one `rfl` that licenses calling the widening a repair rather than a rewrite. -/

/-! ### §1b — THE EMBEDDING: every deployed narrow map-op lifts, ORDER-PRESERVINGLY.

This is the epoch-shape fact. The kind-D sites (digest keys) are only SOME of the 32 committed
map-op-bearing descriptors; the rest key on a derived heap ADDRESS (`heap_root.rs::heap_addr` =
`hash[coll, key]`) and do not need widening. But the map-ops table is ONE shared LogUp bus, so
either everything widens or a second table forks. The embedding below says everything CAN widen
for free: pin lanes 1..7 to `0`, and because lane 0 is the MOST-significant limb, the lex order on
embedded keys IS the ℤ order — so every sorted-tree invariant a narrow op relies on survives the
lift verbatim. No dual AIR, no key-space migration: a re-emit at a wider tuple. -/

/-- The lane vector of the canonical narrow embedding: the felt in lane 0, zeros elsewhere. -/
def e1 (k : ℤ) : Fin 8 → ℤ := fun i => if i = 0 then k else 0

/-- **`embed1 k`** — a deployed 1-felt map key as an 8-felt key. Lane 0 carries the felt (it is the
MOST-significant limb), lanes 1..7 are zero. -/
def embed1 (k : ℤ) : Digest8Key := toLex (e1 k)

/-- **★ THE EMBEDDING IS ORDER-PRESERVING (both directions).** `embed1 a < embed1 b` at the 8-limb
lex order IFF `a < b` at ℤ. So a narrow sorted tree, lifted lane-0-wise into the widened key space,
is sorted by the SAME order it already was — every `Sorted`/`ImtSorted`/gap-bracket fact about a
deployed narrow tree transports across the lift with no re-proof. This is why the widening is a
flag day and not a migration. -/

The deployed leaf is `hash[addr, value, next_addr]` at 3 felts (`aafiLeafHash`,
`IndexedMerkleTree.imtLeafHash`). Widening the key widens BOTH the address and the pointer — the
pointer IS the absence bracket, so a wide addr with a narrow pointer would re-open the 31-bit
waist on the high side of every gap. -/

/-! ## §3 — THE WELD: the emitted lex-8 compare gadget bolted to the widened pointer bracket.

This is the piece nothing had. `LexCompare8Emit.lexLt8_refines` decides `toLex a < toLex b` in the
AIR; `Digest8KeySpike.imtAbsent_excludes_digest8` turns a pointer bracket at the 8-felt key into
absence. A widened `MapKind::Absent` row is EXACTLY: open the low leaf (arity-17), then run the
two blocks. Soundness of that row is the composition below. -/

is the Rust re-emit; leaving it abstract is the same discipline `SortedTreeNonMembershipWide8`
uses). Every leg below is `nonMembership_soundW` / `update_soundW` INSTANTIATED — zero re-proved

/-- **★ WOUND #20's SOUNDNESS ARGUMENT, MACHINE-CHECKED.** A projection is a function, so a key
genuinely present in the wide set is present in the narrow one too: a lane-0 collision can only
ADD to the narrow set's preimage. A same-projection-keyed `.absent` op therefore OVER-includes,
never UNDER-includes — the narrow width buys an attacker NOTHING on the soundness side. (The
soundness shape is the OPPOSITE polarity: a `.present`/membership-AUTHORIZES op.) -/

/-! ## §5 — WOUND #20, both directions, on a concrete committed set.

The committed tree is the spike's `[keyLo, keyHi]`. `keyE` is a genuinely FRESH key that COLLIDES
with the present `keyLo` on lane 0 (`keyE` differs at felt 7 — the limb the deployed projection
discards). This is the ~2^31-offline-grind shape of #20 in miniature: one attacker-ground key
lands in the grow-only set's lane-0 image and poisons a DISTINCT, honest key forever. -/

/-- The lane-0 image of the committed set CONTAINS `proj0 keyE` — via the colliding PRESENT
neighbour `keyLo`, even though `keyE` itself was never inserted. The poisoning, as a fact. -/
theorem narrowKeys_poisoned : proj0 keyE ∈ keysOfW (projOpens demoOpens) () :=
  (mem_keysOfW_projOpens demoOpens () (proj0 keyE)).mpr
    ⟨keyLo, keyLo_present, lowfelt_collision.1.symm⟩

/-- **★ THE AVAILABILITY BREAK (#20), MACHINE-CHECKED.** At the DEPLOYED narrow key there is NO
covering-gap witness for the honest, genuinely-fresh `keyE` — refuted for EVERY spine and EVERY
gap shape, not one. The `.absent` op keyed at lane 0 can never be satisfied for it again: the
spend is permanently unprovable. That is the wound's "~2^31 offline hashes ⇒ permanent DoS on
every undelegated `NoteSpend`", stated as a theorem instead of a paragraph. -/

    (hc : SpineCommitsW (projOpens demoOpens) () spine)

    (hv : g.coversSpine spine) : False :=
  nonMembership_soundW (projOpens demoOpens) () (proj0 keyE) spine hc g hv narrowKeys_poisoned

/-- **★ THE WIDENED KEY SURVIVES.** Against the SAME committed set, the full 8-felt key EXCLUDES
`keyE` — the `keyLo < keyE` bracket is decided at felt 7, the limb the projection discards. The
honest spend is provable again. -/
theorem wideAbsent_provable : keyE ∉ keysOfW demoOpens () := demo_excludes

/-- **★ `dosDelta_site20` — the three-part verdict on wound #20, in one statement.**

  (1) SOUNDNESS is untouched by the width: a genuinely-present key stays present under the
      projection, so the narrow `.absent` op can only OVER-revoke (`narrow_only_over_revokes`).
  (2) AVAILABILITY is broken by the width: the honest fresh `keyE` admits NO narrow gap witness,
      for any spine and any gap shape (`narrowAbsent_unprovable`).
  (3) The WIDENED key repairs exactly (2), leaving (1) intact (`wideAbsent_provable`), and the
      collision is a REAL distinct-key hit, not equality.

This is the priced shape of every kind-D `.absent` site: HIGH availability, NONE soundness. -/
