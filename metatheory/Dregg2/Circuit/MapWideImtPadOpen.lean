# `Dregg2.Circuit.MapWideImtPadOpen` — THE WIDE ANALOGUE OF `padOpen_binds_or_resid`:
  the arity-3 PADDED IMT opening at **8-felt lanes**, floor-free, with NAMED residuals.

`MapAafiLiveRepoint` §10 closed with the one thing it could not close:

> ⚠ NAMED RESIDUAL, not closed here: the WIDE-key (`Digest8Key`) versions of these do not exist.
> The wide analogue of `padOpen_binds_or_resid` — an arity-3 padded opening extractor at 8-felt
> lanes with named residuals instead of `Poseidon2SpongeCR` — is the missing piece, and it is the
> same piece the whole wide file needs to leave the baseline.

This is that piece. `Poseidon2SpongeCR` and `Compress8CR` are PROVED FALSE at deployed BabyBear
parameters, so every wide theorem carrying one is VACUOUSLY TRUE at deployment. The narrow side
escaped in `MapPaddedDenotation` / `MapKindImtGates`: an **unconditional** binding half plus
**named, refutable residuals over SPECIFIC witnesses**, with a clearly-labelled strength bridge at
an injective idealisation. Ported here to the 8-felt lanes.

## THE WIDE FILE'S FLOOR SURFACE, MEASURED (`FloorRatchetBaseline`, HEAD)

Ninety-five grandfathered declarations across the wide-key family carry the refuted
`Poseidon2SpongeCR` — `MapOpWideKeyWeld` 33, `MapOpWideKeyRowBoundary` 28, `MapOpWideKeyGate` 21,
`MapAbsentImtGateWide` 11, `MapOpWideKey` 2 — and `Poseidon2SpongeCR` is the ONLY floor any of them
names. Every one of the 95 routes its crypto through exactly three objects: the arity-9 map-tree
leaf (`leafOfW`), the arity-17 IMT leaf (`imtLeafHash8Of`), and `perfectRoot`. All three are cured
below, so the port is a change of citation, not of proof.

## WHAT IS COMPOSED, NOT RE-DERIVED

The **node layer does not widen** — `perfectRoot` folds a vector of ℤ digests whatever the key
width is. So the entire `_or_collides` spine arrives for free at 8 felts:
`MapPaddedDenotation.mapNode_binds_or_collides` / `foldLevel_binds_or_collides` /
`perfectRoot_binds_or_collides`, the padding algebra (`padTo`, `PadHit`,
`append_replicate_eq_or_hit`, `padTo_eq_or_hit`, `padTo_getElem?`, `padTo_set`, `padTo_snoc_pad`),
the floor-free path law `MapOpsColumnLayout.pathRecompute_binds_updates_or_collides` with its
`pathCollFind` extractor, and the symbolic sparse paths `leftPadPath` / `slot1Path`. Nothing in
that list is restated.

What is genuinely NEW is the **lane-encoded IMT leaf and its relink**: `imtLeafHashE E`, the
arity-`2·E.width + 1` absorb `E.enc addr ‖ value ‖ E.enc next`, and `imtChainOfE`, the relink at an
arbitrary key type. Both are pinned to the landed objects by `rfl`:

  * `imtLeafHashE hash narrowEnc = imtLeafHash hash` — the DEPLOYED arity-3 leaf;
  * `imtLeafHashE hash wideEnc = imtLeafHash8Of hash` — the landed arity-**17** wide leaf, whose
    17 = `2 · 8 + 1` is a `rfl` theorem here (`imtLeafPreE_wide_arity`).

So this is one law at two encodings, and the kernel certifies both ends.

## THE RESIDUALS ARE OVER SPECIFIC NAMED WITNESSES

`OpenResidE` has the same three disjuncts the narrow `OpenResid` has, at the wide leaf:

  1. `IsSpongeColl hash (pathCollFind hash steps (padVecE …) (imtLeafHashE hash E l))` — a genuine
     collision at the pair the TOTAL path extractor returns for THIS path and THIS committed vector;
  2. `IsSpongeColl hash (imtLeafPreE E (chainAtE sent h (pathPos steps)), imtLeafPreE E l)` — a
     genuine collision at the arity-17 leaf pair the TOTAL `chainAtE` extractor names;
  3. `imtLeafHashE hash E l = padDigest` — the opened digest IS `heap_root.rs`'s padding constant.

⚠ None of these is `∃ a b, a ≠ b ∧ hash a = hash b`, which is simply TRUE at deployed parameters
and is a free pass. Each names the PARTICULAR pair a total function of committed data returns.
`ImtLaneTeeth` (§5) is `MapPaddedDenotation.MapLeafTeeth` at a lane encoding, carrying the same two
anti-laundering fields — `resid_refuted` (the residual vanishes at a hash-level `Good`) and
`good_inhabited` (`Good` is non-empty) — so `Resid := True` and `Resid := (h₁ ≠ h₂)` are
unbuildable.

## ⚑⚑ THE TWELFTH IMPOSSIBILITY — WIDENING THE KEY DOES NOT KILL THE PADDING GHOST

Eleven obvious approaches on this epoch have been proved impossible. Here is the twelfth, and it is
the one a reader of the wide epoch would most naturally assume away. `MapPaddedDenotation`'s header
prices the padding ghost at "~2^31 at this 1-felt commitment, ~2^124 at the deployed 8-felt tree",
which invites the reading that the kind-D widening buys the ghost away. It does not, and §8 proves
it: the widening moves the **key** from 1 felt to 8; the padding constant lives in the **digest**,
which is one felt at every key width. `padded_imt8_injectivity_is_refuted` refutes padded
injectivity at `wideEnc` at the DEPLOYED depth, at a hash that IS injective, on heaps that satisfy
`wideEnc.HeapOk` — i.e. sorted AND canonically keyed, the L3 closure included.
`wide_hardenings_do_not_kill_the_ghost` packages the verdict: all three of the epoch's hardenings
(8-felt keys, canonical committed heaps, an injective sponge) hold simultaneously and the ghost
survives. Only a domain-separated padding constant reaches it, exactly as the narrow finding said.

## NON-VACUITY AT `MAP_TREE_DEPTH = 16`, OVER A SPARSE TREE (§7)

A `2^16`-leaf wide commitment holding ONE live leaf, every other cell `EMPTY_SUBTREE_ROOTS` — the
occupancy `CanonicalHeapTree::new` actually produces, and the one the DENSE wide laws
(`c.length = 2 ^ dep`, `MapAbsentImtGateWide`'s named residual #1) have no witness for at all. Both
polarities on both deployed-shaped wide arms: the `.absent` row (24 emitted rows across the seven
committed registries) and the AAFI row (24 emitted rows, the arm that SHIPS). Every root is NAMED
as the padded commitment and never evaluated; every path is the symbolic `leftPadPath` / `slot1Path`
recursion; nothing is enumerated and no `decide` touches a depth-16 object.

## Floors
**NONE, and none assumed.** `Poseidon2SpongeCR` appears in no type and no `Prop`-def body in this
file. The binding halves take no hypothesis on `hash` at all. The `_of_good` bridges ride
`MapGoodE E hash := Function.Injective hash ∧ PadFreeE E hash`, which is `padImtLaneTeeth`'s own
`Good` FIELD (`mapGoodE_is_teeth_good`, `Iff.rfl`) — the same discipline, and the same labelling,
`MapKindImtGates.MapGood` carries: ⚠ the bridge is at an injective idealisation, so only the
`_or_resid` halves are statements about the deployed sponge.

## Axiom hygiene
`#assert_axioms` ⊆ {propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}; sorry-free; no `native_decide`; no
`decide` on any object containing the depth-16 spine. NEW file; every import read-only; no deployed
descriptor / emit / JSON / Rust byte touched.

/-! ## §1 — THE LANE-ENCODED IMT LEAF: one absorb, two deployed instances.

`IndexedMerkleTree.imtLeafHash` absorbs `[addr, value, nextAddr]` — arity 3 because the key
contributes ONE felt. `MapOpWideKeyGate.imtLeafHash8Of` absorbs `addr8 ‖ value ‖ next8` — arity 17
because it contributes EIGHT. Both are `imtLeafHashE` at a `LaneEnc`, and both come back by `rfl`.
The pointer widens with the address, never separately: `halfWideLeaf_forges_absence_of_present`
already proves a wide address with a projected pointer forges a non-membership. -/

`MapPaddedDenotation.MapLeafTeeth` is `Heap.FeltHeap`-pinned. This is the same bundle at key type
`K`, carrying the SAME two anti-laundering fields, and the three anti-ghost theorems are proved ONCE
over it. Every instance inherits them; a `Resid := True` or `Resid := (h₁ ≠ h₂)` bundle cannot be
built, because `resid_refuted` would force a good hash to identify all heaps and `good_inhabited`
says good hashes exist. -/

days refuting. Both wide arms get BOTH polarities on the shape `heap_root.rs` actually builds — a

evaluates a root or a `2^16` object: every root is NAMED as the padded commitment, and every path is

/-! ## §8 — ⚑⚑ THE TWELFTH IMPOSSIBILITY: WIDENING THE KEY DOES NOT KILL THE PADDING GHOST.

The natural reading of stage 2b's pricing — "~2^31 at this 1-felt commitment, ~2^124 at the deployed
8-felt tree" — is that the kind-D widening buys the padding ghost away. It does not. The widening
moves the KEY from 1 felt to 8; the padding constant is a DIGEST, and the digest is one felt at
every key width. Nor do the epoch's other two hardenings reach it: `wideEnc.HeapOk`'s canonicity
(the L3 closure) is a property of KEYS, and the ghost heaps below are canonically keyed; and
injectivity of the sponge is a property the ghost hash SATISFIES.

So the residual stays exactly what the narrow finding said it was — a FIXED-TARGET PREIMAGE of a
literal constant, repaired only by a DOMAIN-SEPARATED padding digest, which is a deployed-side
change and not a Lean one. -/
