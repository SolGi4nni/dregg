# Dregg2.Circuit.MembershipBindingFromFold — the DEPLOYED membership binding, proven from the FOLD.

## Why this file exists (the flip)

`MembershipBackingAttack` proved the deployed `SenderAuthorized` leg VACUOUS as a pure light
client sees it: the deployed AIR gates only the transfer transition, never the sender-membership
Merkle path (`deployed_admits_unbacked_membership`, `deployed_admits_injected_root`,
`deployed_intent_does_not_force_membership`). The repair it NAMED — the backing must come from the
per-turn FOLD over a re-proved MEMBERSHIP leaf connected to the published
`(sender_leaf, authorized_root)` teeth — is now DEPLOYED:

  * THE BIG-BANG REGEN pinned the exposure: the committed wide registry row is
    `CarrierComposed.transferV3MembershipWide` — the two teeth columns (past the wide carriers,
    1771..1772) row-0-pinned at claim PIs 50..51 (`MEMBERSHIP_CLAIM_PI_LO` —
    `transferV3MembershipWide_publishes_teeth`, `#assert_axioms`-clean). The apex rides the narrow
    member at `Rfix 0` (`Rfix_transfer`).
  * The FOLD arm is live (`ivc_turn_chain::prove_chain_core_rotated`, Membership arm): the
    per-turn aggregate folds the re-proven membership leaf
    (`membership_leaf_adapter::prove_membership_leaf_with_claim` — the REAL `dsl::membership`
    Merkle STARK, sender-compress executor-ALIGNED since `687601953`), RE-VERIFIES it via the
    recursion, and CONNECTS the leaf's exposed tuple to the leg's published claim PIs
    (`prove_membership_binding_node_segmented`). The deployed-path tooth
    (`membership_binding_deployed_tooth.rs`) exercises BOTH poles on the NATIVE committed row.

## ⚑ HONEST SCOPE (the fail-open law — what this flip does and does NOT claim)

The deployed-AIR leg is the PI EXPOSURE only (`CarrierComposed` §5): the in-AIR sender-compress /
fields-root read welds stay the named `MembershipAuthRootEdge` seams, so
`MembershipBackingAttack` §A/§A′ STAND as deployed-AIR facts. What THIS module proves is the FOLD
edge — for the AGGREGATE a light client verifies, a published tuple claim must be backed by a
verifying membership sub-proof (the exact predicate the attack file staged), with both
non-vacuity poles. The mirror of `FactoryBindingFromFold` over the universal sub-proof-folding
primitive.

  * **`membership_binding_from_fold`** — a verifying AGGREGATE FORCES, for the leg's published
    tuple claim `f.tup`: (binding) ∃ a verifying membership sub-proof `q` with
    `E.piCommit q = f.tup`, and (anti-ghost) the attested path is DETERMINED by `f.tup`.
    Premises = the `custom_binding_from_fold` set; no staged-AIR carrier.

  * **`authorized_from_fold`** — the GROUNDING onto `MembershipBackingAttack.Authorized`: when
    the folded leaf's semantics is the re-proved `verify_membership_dsl` (a verifying membership
    sub-proof exposing the leg's published tuple IS a verifying Merkle path attesting it — the
    `membership_leaf_adapter` obligation, carried as `hbacks`), a satisfying fold DISCHARGES the
    exact membership predicate the attack file showed the deployed AIR omits.

## Non-vacuity (BOTH polarities, mirroring the Rust tooth)

`honest_companion_fires` — on an honest sender-authorized transfer the grounded binding FIRES.
`forged_unsat` / `forged_tuple_unsat_demo` — a fold whose published tuple claim is the
`MembershipBackingAttack` §A forgery (`sender_leaf = 0`, backed by NO verifying path) CANNOT
satisfy: the aggregate is UNSAT — the circuit twin of
`deployed_membership_turn_forged_tuple_rejected`.

## Axiom hygiene
`#assert_axioms` on every load-bearing arm ⊆ {propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}. The floor
carriers appear ONLY as Prop hypotheses. NO new axiom, NO `sorry`. NEW file; imports read-only.
