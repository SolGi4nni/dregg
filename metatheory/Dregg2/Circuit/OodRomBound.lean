# `Dregg2.Circuit.OodRomBound` — the ROM half of survey finding #4: bounding the
exceptional-probability of the TRANSCRIPT-BOUND OOD point.

Part (a) (`FriTranscriptBind`) made ζ a FUNCTION of the transcript: `verifyAlgoTB` acceptance
forces `proof.oodPoint = deriveOod perm RATE extDeg initState proof pub`
(`verifyAlgoTB_forces_ood_transcript_bound`) — the EXACT deployed p3 squeeze (observe trace,
observe publics, sample α, observe quotient chunks, squeeze ζ). Part (b), here, is the
PROBABILISTIC half: how often does that transcript-derived ζ land in the exceptional set of a
residual `R`?

## The honest floor — `RomUniform` (THE named residual of this file)

For a FIXED permutation `perm`, `deriveOod` is a deterministic function and NO uniformity of the
squeezed ζ is provable — a fixed sponge output is whatever it is. The standard cryptographic move
is the RANDOM-ORACLE idealization: over a freshly sampled trace commitment, the squeeze output is
distributed as a uniform draw from `F`. We state this HONESTLY as the named Prop `RomUniform`:
the distribution the map `ω ↦ ζ(ω)` induces on `F` (over the finite sampled-transcript space `Ω`)
EQUALS the uniform sampling distribution — expressed event-by-event as an equality of `winProb`s,
`winProb (acc ∘ ζmap) = winProb acc` for every event `acc : F → Bool`. This is exactly "the
induced distribution of `deriveOod` equals the uniform `oodNonExcAcc` sampling distribution", and
it is where the argument bottoms out. It is a GENUINE assumption, not a tautology:

  * SATISFIABLE — and satisfiable at the REAL `deriveOod` algorithm: for the identity permutation
    over `ZMod 7` (RATE 1) the derived ζ is a bijection of the observed commitment, so
    `RomUniform` HOLDS (`romUniformDerive_id_perm_holds`, via `romUniform_of_bijective`).
  * REFUTABLE — a degenerate constant permutation makes `deriveOod` constant, and `RomUniform`
    FAILS (`romUniformDerive_const_perm_fails`, via `not_romUniform_const`). So the Prop
    genuinely discriminates good squeezes from bad ones; assuming it for Poseidon2 is the ROM
    idealization, named and visible, never an axiom.

## What is PROVED under that named floor

  * `transcriptBound_ood_escape_le` — THE TRANSPORT: under `RomUniform ζmap`, the probability the
    transcript-bound ζ lands in `exceptionalSet R` is `≤ natDegree R / |F|`. One rewrite across
    the distribution equality lands on the already-proved Schwartz–Zippel game bound
    (`OodSoundnessGame.oodNonExc_winProb_le`); nothing further is assumed.
  * `deriveOod_escape_le` / `…_babybear` — the same bound with `ζmap` the ACTUAL
    `FriTranscriptBind.deriveOod` squeeze over an adaptive prover strategy
    `proofOf : Ω → BatchProofData F` (`RomUniformDerive`), specialized to the deployed field:
    `≤ natDegree R / 2013265921`.
  * `ood_nonexceptionality_is_bounded` — THE PAYOFF: the joint event "`verifyAlgoTB` ACCEPTS and
    the proof's OOD point is exceptional for `R`" has probability `≤ natDegree R / |F|`. The
    composition is real: acceptance FORCES ζ transcript-bound (part (a), now over the full
    `proof`/`pub` squeeze), and the bound rides the forced value through `RomUniform`. The carried
    `FriLdtExtractV3` "ζ non-exceptional" clause is thereby a BOUNDED-ADVANTAGE event under
    transcript-binding + `RomUniform` — no longer a free prover choice.
    `hnonexc_clause_bounded_babybear` states it at the deployed residual
    `constraintPoly d t c − vanishingPoly t · qp c` over BabyBear.

## FIRE (non-vacuity, both poles)

`transcriptBound_escape_fires`: on the concrete `ZMod 7` instance with the REAL `deriveOod`, the
escape probability is EXACTLY `1/7 = natDegree X / |F|` — a genuine positive real in `[0,1]`,
tight against the bound. Plus the satisfiable/refutable poles of `RomUniform` above, and the
concrete-degree unit-interval check `ood_escape_deg4_babybear`.

## Residual after this file

`RomUniform` (equivalently its `deriveOod` instance `RomUniformDerive` at the deployed
Poseidon2-w16 permutation) — the ROM idealization of the duplex-sponge squeeze. Everything else
(the transport, the composition with transcript-binding, the Schwartz–Zippel numerator) is proved.

`deriveOod`) induces on `F` EXACTLY the uniform sampling distribution: for EVERY event
`acc : F → Bool`, the probability of the event under the induced distribution equals its
probability under a uniform draw — `winProb (acc ∘ ζmap) = winProb acc`. This is the distribution
equality "`deriveOod` over the idealized random permutation ≡ the uniform `oodNonExcAcc` sampling
distribution". It is NOT provable for a fixed permutation (a fixed sponge output is deterministic)
— it is the floor this file's bounds stand on, a named hypothesis, never an axiom. It genuinely
discriminates: satisfiable (`romUniform_of_bijective`, `romUniformDerive_id_perm_holds`), refutable

/-! ## §4 — THE PAYOFF: acceptance + exceptionality is a bounded-advantage event.

Part (a) forces the accepted proof's ζ to BE the transcript squeeze; §2 bounds the squeeze's
escape probability. Composing: the joint event "`verifyAlgoTB` accepts AND the proof's OOD point
is exceptional" is bounded — the carried `FriLdtExtractV3` non-exceptionality clause is no longer
a free prover choice. -/

/-- **`ood_nonexceptionality_is_bounded` — the composed payoff.** For any adaptive prover strategy
`proofOf : Ω → BatchProofData F` (the ROM variable: each sampled transcript randomness ω yields
the submitted proof data), under `RomUniformDerive` at the verifier's own α width `params.extDeg`:
the probability that `verifyAlgoTB` ACCEPTS and the proof's OOD point lies in `exceptionalSet R`
is `≤ natDegree R / |F|`. The composition is genuine —
`verifyAlgoTB_forces_ood_transcript_bound` (part (a)) pins the accepted ζ to
`deriveOod … (proofOf ω) pub` (the EXACT deployed squeeze), and the `RomUniform` transport (§2)
bounds the escape. The "ζ non-exceptional" clause carried by `FriLdtExtractV3` is now a
bounded-advantage event, not an assumption about the prover's will. -/

Everything here runs the ACTUAL sponge algorithm (`Challenger.observe`/`duplexing`/`sampleExt`)
over `ZMod 7`, RATE 1, α width `extDeg = 1`, with the prover strategy submitting the sampled
element as its trace commitment (`toyProof ω`, empty publics/quotient — the FULL new squeeze
sequence runs: observe trace, observe publics, sample α, observe quotient, squeeze ζ). With the
identity permutation the squeeze returns exactly the observed element (a bijection ⇒ `RomUniform`
HOLDS); with a constant permutation it is constant (⇒ `RomUniform` FAILS). So the named floor is
neither vacuously true nor vacuously false at the real algorithm, and the composed escape
probability is EXACTLY `deg/|F|` on a concrete instance. -/
