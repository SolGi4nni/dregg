# Dregg2.Circuit.PeepholeEmitMembership — THE LOWERING EMITS ITS OWN MEMBERSHIP FACTS.

STATE THE SUBSTRATE OUT LOUD: this is Lean-authored AIR. Nothing here hand-writes a constraint. Every
theorem below is a statement ABOUT the constraint list that `TypedLinearPredicateDescriptorIR2.descriptor`
emits from a `Formula`, proved by induction ON THE FORMULA — no constraint list is ever re-evaluated,
no `decide`, no `native_decide`.

## The wall this removes

`PeepholeFrontierScanSound.frontier_preservation_S` is a ∀-d theorem: the frontier collapse is a
genuine `SatisfiabilityPreservation` on every `FrontierCertifiedS` descriptor. Instantiating it on a
CONCRETE descriptor needed `out ∈ acceptReachableS (kept)` as a KERNEL Prop — and kernel-reducing the
pilot's 374-constraint fixpoint scan is exactly the OOM class. Four lanes left that concrete
certification open. Bespoke per-descriptor membership arguments do not scale either.

## The fix — three structural moves, none of which evaluates a scan

1. **The repair theorem** (§5, `forcedS_kept_of_forced`). `acceptReachable_sound` already hands us a
   `Forced` certificate over the FULL constraint list for free (a collapse site is recognised only if
   its output is accept-reachable). The ONLY thing that can break when re-running such a derivation
   over the SURVIVING list is a dropped BIT gate: accept gates and and-gates are never dropped
   (`frontierKeep_acceptGate`, `frontierKeep_andGate`, both `rfl`). So `Forced cs c` upgrades to
   `ForcedS kept c` under ONE side condition:

       (H)  every and-gate `out − l·r` in the list has a child whose bit gate SURVIVES.

   `ForcedS`'s own-bit constructors (`andLself`/`andRself`) and its sibling constructors together
   cover both ways the surviving gate can sit.

2. **(H) is discharged BY THE LOWERING** (§4, §6). An and-gate in the emitted list can only have come
   from an emitted `.and` node (§4 inverts the emission: public pins are `.base`; an atom link's body
   is `x − affine` and an affine window is NEVER `l·r`, `AffineTerm.toWindowAt_ne_mul_loc`; the accept
   gate's second factor is a constant; `.or`/`.not`/zeroTest bodies have different heads). That node's
   children are the OUTPUT WIRES of the two subformulas, and every subformula emits its own booleanity
   gate (`bitGate_of_outputAt`). So the right child's bit gate is in the list; it survives unless the
   right child's column is a COLLAPSED output — and a collapsed output is always a zeroTest output
   (§4, via the inverse-gate inversion), while an `.and`/`.or`/`.not` subformula's output column is an
   OP output. §3 proves those two column classes DISJOINT by the allocation ranges
   (`opOut_not_ztOut`), by induction on the formula. Hence: if every `.and` node's RIGHT child is an
   op-node (`AndRightOp`, a purely syntactic property of the SOURCE FORMULA), (H) holds.

3. **The concrete certifications** (§7). `AndRightOp` is proved for the field-delta pilot's source
   (`andAll [atom0, atom1, boolAtom 0, …, boolAtom 29]`, by induction on the conjunct list — the
   `andAll` recursion, not by unfolding 31 nodes) and for `secondDescriptor`. That yields, as PROVEN
   Props on the REAL descriptors:

       pilot_frontierCertifiedS   : FrontierCertifiedS (descriptor prog)
       pilot_frontier_preservation : SatisfiabilityPreservation (frontierPass (descriptor prog))
       second_frontier_preservation : SatisfiabilityPreservation (frontierPass secondDescriptor)

   No `#guard` carries any of these; a `#guard` proves no Prop.

## `AndRightOp` is a REAL precondition, not a proof artifact

The frontier collapse is UNSOUND on `.and (.atom i) (.atom j)`: both zero-tests are accept-reachable,
so both collapse, and the target then retains NO constraint pinning either output to a bit — take
`out_i = 2`, `out_j = 2⁻¹`, `x_i = x_j = 0`: every surviving gate holds while the source's booleanity
gate fails. A certificate for that shape cannot exist, and the hypothesis that at least one child of
each conjunction is an op-node is exactly what rules it out. Both real descriptors satisfy it.

## Named residual (no `sorry`, no stand-in)

* The certification is for descriptors emitted by `TypedLinearPredicateDescriptorIR2.descriptor`
  (equivalently the `DirectLogicBoolGraph` lowering it wraps). A descriptor from a DIFFERENT emitter
  gets nothing here; it needs its own emission-inversion lemmas (§4 is where they would go).
* `AndRightOp` is sufficient, not necessary: an `.and` whose LEFT child is an op-node is equally
  certifiable (swap `andLsib`/`andRself` for `andLself`/`andRsib` in §5). The stated form is the one
  both real descriptors satisfy; the general "some child is an op-node" variant is the obvious
  strengthening and is not proved here.
* Everything inherits the undischarged FRI/STARK floor: this is a refinement between two constraint
  systems, not a proof that the deployed prover is sound.

Standalone and additive: imports `PeepholeFrontierScanSound`; changes none of it.

`AndRightOp` is refutable on exactly the shape where the collapse is unsound (`atom ∧ atom`): both
zero-tests are accept-reachable, so both collapse, and the target then pins NEITHER output to a bit —
`out_i = 2`, `out_j = 2⁻¹`, `x_i = x_j = 0` satisfies every surviving gate while the source's
booleanity gate fails. So this is a real precondition, not a proof convenience. -/
