# Dregg2.Circuit.PeepholeGeneralPass — a GENERAL syntactic peephole recognizer over the
constraint list, plus the certified single-site rule it drives, on ARBITRARY descriptors.

STATE THE SUBSTRATE OUT LOUD: this is Lean-authored AIR. Nothing here hand-writes a constraint;
the recognizer READS the constraint list that `TypedLinearPredicateDescriptorIR2.descriptor` emits,
and the certified rule is the already-proven `PeepholePassCertified.rwPass` /
`PeepholeR2Certified.rwR2Pass` on the EMITTED descriptor.

## What this closes — the program-specificity of the batch

`PeepholeBatchCertified` collapses the whole pilot spine in one certified pass, but it FIRES via
`pilot_holds_iff` — a lemma that unfolds `prog.source` and indexes the pilot's own atom registry
(`atomTerms_bool`). It is therefore keyed to that ONE program. E1
(`EffectVmDescriptor2PassiveOptimization`) is the opposite: a general `EffectVmDescriptor2 →
EffectVmDescriptor2` pass whose recognizer (`deadColsE1`) reads the descriptor. This module supplies
the missing general RECOGNIZER for the peephole family, matching E1's architecture:

`recognizePeephole : EffectVmDescriptor2 → List PeepholeSite` scans `d.constraints` and pattern-
matches, purely syntactically and independent of any source program:

* the R1 SHAPE — a zero-test's distinctive gate `x · out = 0` (`.mul (.loc x) (.loc out)`), which no
  other emitted node produces at top level (an ∧-node's product is wrapped in `subW`, `bitBody`'s
  product has an `.add` right factor); it records `.zeroTest x out`;
* the R2 SHAPE — an ∨-node's distinctive gate `out − ((l+r) − l·r) = 0`, whose fully-unfolded
  `WindowExpr` is a fixed tree; it records `.orNode out`.

The elided-site data (the tested column `x`, the disjunction bit `out`) is READ OFF THE CONSTRAINT
SHAPE, exactly as the batch's per-site rebuild values are determined by the shape and not the source
program.

## What is PROVEN here

* `recognize_sees_r1_site` / `recognize_sees_r2_site` — for ARBITRARY `terms/a/rest` (resp.
  `terms/c0/c1/rest`), the recognizer applied to the EMITTED descriptor
  `descriptor (rootProgram …)` returns a list CONTAINING the R1 (resp. R2) site the certified rule
  rewrites. This is the general "the recognizer sees the site" bridge, over every program of the
  family, not one pilot.
* `generalR1Preservation` / `generalR2Preservation` — the certified single-site rule, re-exposed as
  a `SatisfiabilityPreservation` on the descriptor the recognizer's site names; and the E1
  composition (`generalR1WithE1`).
* GENERALITY (the lane's demonstration): the recognizer FIRES with the correct counts on the
  field-delta pilot descriptor (62 zero-test sites + 30 ∨-sites) AND on a second, independently
  built `Program 1 1 3` (one asserted equality + one asserted booleanity → 3 zero-test sites + 1
  ∨-site), and the certified R1 rule certifies on that second descriptor (`second_r1_roundtrip`).

## Named residuals (no `sorry`, no stand-in)

* CANDIDATE, not frontier-qualified. `recognizePeephole` returns EVERY zero-test / ∨ shape,
  including the load-bearing zero-tests UNDER a disjunction (which R1 must not elide). The
  asserted-FRONTIER qualification (only the zero-test whose bit feeds the accept path) is what the
  certified rule's site selects; enforcing it syntactically — a reachability scan from the accept
  gate — is the named next leg. Over-recognition cannot make any rewrite unsound: the certified rule
  carries the real gate and is proved against the emitted descriptor regardless.
* ONE-PASS ALL-SITES. The certified rule here fires at ONE recognized site (`rwPass` / `rwR2Pass`).
  Folding all recognized sites into a single pass with a full `SecurityRefinement` — the
  program-INDEPENDENT generalization of `PeepholeBatchCertified.batch_security` — is the remaining
  leg; the batch already does the all-at-once collapse, but via the program-specific
  `pilot_holds_iff`. The recognizer + per-site certified rule here is the general half.

Standalone and additive: imports the R1/R2 certified modules and the pilot; changes none of them.

/-! ## 4. GENERALITY leg #1 — the recognizer FIRES on the field-delta pilot descriptor.

The pilot's source `atom0 ∧ atom1 ∧ ⋀_{j<30}(b_j=0 ∨ b_j=1)` materializes 62 zero-test nodes (2 on
the asserted frontier + 2 per disjunction × 30) and 30 ∨-nodes; the recognizer counts exactly those

zero-test sites (the frontier + the two under the ∨) and 1 ∨-site — demonstrating the recognizer is
