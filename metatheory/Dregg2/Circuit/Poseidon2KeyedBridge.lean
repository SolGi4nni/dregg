# `Dregg2.Circuit.Poseidon2KeyedBridge` — bridging the DEPLOYED UNKEYED Poseidon2 sponge to the
KEYED collision game (the honest keyed-from-unkeyed-via-domain-separation model).

## The obligation this closes

`HashFloorHonesty.lean` replaced the VACUOUS injective hash floor (`Poseidon2Binding.Poseidon2SpongeCR`,
false at real BabyBear params by pigeonhole) with what it called a PROPER computational floor —
`CollisionResistant F` over a **KEYED** hash family `F` — and `FloorRegroundedConsumers.lean` re-seated
every STARK/FRI/binding
consumer (`OodCommitmentBinding`, `FriSoundness.oracle_binding`, `AirSoundness.committed_trace_pinned`,
`FinBindsKernel`) onto that keyed floor as advantage bounds.

Keying is LOAD-BEARING: an UNKEYED fixed hash lets an adversary hardcode a known collision (advantage
`1`), collapsing the floor. BUT the DEPLOYED Poseidon2 (`p3-poseidon2-circuit-air` BabyBear width-16,
`Poseidon2Binding.babyBearD4W16`) is a FIXED, UNKEYED sponge `List ℤ → ℤ`. So there is a genuine
"bridge to the real object" gap: the consumers rested on a collision floor for an ABSTRACT keyed
family `F`, while the prover computes a fixed unkeyed function. This file connects the two.

⚑ **AND THE FLOOR IT BRIDGED TO IS ITSELF DELETED (2026-07-28).** `HashFloorHonesty.CollisionResistant`
was `FloorGames.HashCRHardQuant F (fun _ => True)` under a name that hid the adversary class, and that
class is exactly what makes it FALSE for a compressing hash. The BRIDGE below is untouched and still
correct — the keyed family, the domain-separation model and the faithfulness lemmas were never the
problem. What changed is that `DomainSeparatedCR`'s body now spells out the `⊤`, so the ⚠⚠ warning at
§3 no longer needs a lemma to be visible. The honest successor with a real class is
`Circuit.DomainSeparatedCREffRegrounded.DomainSeparatedCREff D Eff`.

## The standard bridge: domain separation IS the key

The deployed sponge's effective "key" is its **domain-separation tag** — the per-use prefix
(`PaddingFreeSponge` over the round-constant/rate-capacity regime, absorbed ahead of the message) that
the deployment uses to separate the Merkle-node hash from the leaf hash from the log hash from the OOD
commitment. Modelling that tag as the key of a keyed family is the standard way a real FIXED hash
receives a keyed collision-resistance treatment (the keyed-from-unkeyed / domain-separation model). The
keyed CR game then FAITHFULLY MODELS the deployed hash: its win event at the deployed tag is
DEFINITIONALLY a collision of the deployed unkeyed function `xs ↦ sponge (tag ++ xs)`.

  * **§1** — `DomainSeparatedSponge`: the deployed unkeyed sponge + its finite domain-separation tag
    space + the tag-absorption encoding + the specific deployed tag the prover uses.
  * **§2** — `poseidon2KeyedFamily`: that bundle lifted to a `HashFloorHonesty.KeyedHashFamily`, keyed
    by the domain-separation tag. FAITHFULNESS (`deployed_hash_is_family_instance`,
    `wins_iff_deployed_collision`): the deployed fixed hash IS the family instance at the deployed tag,
    and a keyed-game win at any tag is exactly a deployed-hash collision — the game models the real
    object, no idealization.
  * **§3** — the NAMED domain-separation floor `DomainSeparatedCR D := HashCRHardQuant
    (poseidon2KeyedFamily D) ⊤`. Read the ⚠⚠ at §3 BEFORE reading the rest of this bullet, which is
    the 07-22 claim and is WRONG at the `⊤` this floor is fixed at: SATISFIABLE (a
    domain-separated family over an injective sponge is CR — `domainSeparatedCR_of_injective_sponge`,
    witnessed concretely by `Reference.refSponge` at the REAL `babyBearD4W16` params) and REFUTABLE (a
    broken domain separation — the tag-ignoring constant sponge — has advantage `1`,
    `brokenDomainSep_not_CR`). NOT an injectivity/existence-refutation: the win event is *finding* a
    collision over a random tag, not the mere *existence* of one.
  * **§4** — the connection: under `DomainSeparatedCR D`, the `FloorRegroundedConsumers` advantage
    bounds fire at `F := poseidon2KeyedFamily D`, so the deployed circuit's keyed-CR floor is BRIDGED to
    the real deployed hash — `FinBindsKernel`'s root binder, the OOD/Merkle/trace binders, and the apex
    two-hash forgery advantage all rest on the deployed sponge's domain-separation CR.

## Axiom hygiene

`#assert_axioms` ⊆ {propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}; NO `sorryAx`/`sorry`, NO fresh `axiom`. The
named floor `DomainSeparatedCR` is a HYPOTHESIS (never an `axiom`) and is refutable — but it is NOT
satisfiable at the deployed sponge (§3's ⚠⚠), so the bridge theorems below are genuine implications
with a FALSE antecedent, which is what `DomainSeparatedCREffRegrounded` exists to repair. The keyed
family reuses `HashFloorHonesty.KeyedHashFamily` and the deployed sponge is the `Poseidon2Binding`
`List ℤ → ℤ` object.

/-! ## §1 — the deployed unkeyed sponge with its domain-separation structure.

The deployed Poseidon2 (`Poseidon2Binding.babyBearD4W16`) is a fixed sponge `sponge : List ℤ → ℤ`. Its
effective KEY is the domain-separation tag: a finite set of per-use prefixes the deployment absorbs
ahead of the message. `deployedTag` is the specific tag the prover computes at a given use-site (so the
deployed FIXED function is `xs ↦ sponge (tagCode deployedTag ++ xs)`). -/

/-- The deployed unkeyed Poseidon2 sponge together with its domain-separation structure. `sponge` is the
`Poseidon2Binding` `List ℤ → ℤ` object (the real `babyBearD4W16` PaddingFreeSponge); `Tag` is the
finite, inhabited domain-separation tag space; `tagCode` is how a tag is absorbed as a prefix;
`deployedTag` is the specific tag the deployment uses. -/

/-! ## §3 — the NAMED domain-separation floor: SATISFIABLE + REFUTABLE (a genuine floor). -/

/-- **`DomainSeparatedCR D`** — the deployed Poseidon2's domain-separation collision-resistance: the
keyed family (keyed by the domain-separation tag) has the collision floor AT THE UNRESTRICTED
ADVERSARY CLASS. This was presented as the honest deployed-hash assumption — the
keyed-from-unkeyed-via-domain-separation model. It is a HYPOTHESIS (never an `axiom`), and it is
refutable (§ `brokenDomainSep_not_CR`) and satisfiable only by a non-compressing sponge
(§ `domainSeparatedCR_of_injective_sponge`), which is the whole trouble — read the ⚠⚠ next.

⚠⚠ **BROKEN AS NAMED — THIS FLOOR IS FALSE AT THE DEPLOYED SPONGE, so every §4 consumer below
(including the APEX `deployed_lightclientUnfoolable_advantage_bound`) is VACUOUSLY TRUE at deployed
parameters.** `Circuit.DomainSeparatedCREffRegrounded.domainSeparatedCR_false_babyBear` proves it;
`docs/deos/VACUITY-SWEEP.md` FINDING 2. The paragraph above claiming this is "a GENUINE floor …
SATISFIABLE and REFUTABLE … NOT an injectivity/existence-refutation" is WRONG, and `FloorGames` (07-16)
is why: this floor IS `HashCRHardQuant F ⊤` (as of 2026-07-28 its body says so literally) and
`Hard G ⊤ ↔ Negl (solvableFrac G)`, so it IS the existence floor, hence FALSE
wherever collisions merely EXIST — which at a BabyBear-bounded sponge is every tag. Same pigeonhole
that killed `Poseidon2SpongeCR`, one `Classical.choice` later. Domain separation does not help: the
prefix is injective, but the prefixed map still lands in one bounded field.

⚠ **AND `refDomainSep_CR` BELOW IS THE TELL, NOT THE REASSURANCE.**
`domainSeparatedCR_forces_unbounded_sponge` proves anything discharging this floor has an
INFINITE-RANGE sponge — i.e. is not a field hash at all. That is exactly why `Reference.refSponge` (an
injective `Encodable`-style map into ALL of `ℤ`) satisfies it and the deployed BabyBear sponge cannot.
Toy witness satisfiable, real hash false — `HashFloorHonesty`'s own diagnosis of its own predecessor,
recurring here, in the file written to cure it.

⚑ **HONEST SCOPE — nothing here is WRONG and nothing deployed is unsafe today.** The consumers are
true; they are true VACUOUSLY, so they transport no security. This file's REAL contributions STAND and
are untouched: the keyed family, the domain-separation model, and the faithfulness lemmas
(`deployed_hash_is_family_instance`, `wins_iff_deployed_collision`) — the game genuinely IS about the
deployed function. The game was never the problem. The adversary CLASS was.

**The honest replacement is `Circuit.DomainSeparatedCREffRegrounded`** —
`DomainSeparatedCREff D Eff := HashCRHardQuant (poseidon2KeyedFamily D) Eff`: the SAME game over the
SAME family (so every faithfulness lemma applies verbatim) at an EXPLICIT class, with every §4 consumer
re-grounded and `domainSeparatedCREff_top_iff_old` proving this def IS that one at `⊤`. This def is
KEPT so the record and the teeth keep compiling.

⚑ **2026-07-28 — THE BODY NOW SAYS `⊤` OUT LOUD.** It used to read
`CollisionResistant (poseidon2KeyedFamily D)`, and that `def` is DELETED: it WAS
`HashCRHardQuant F (fun _ => True)` wearing a name that hid the adversary class. So this floor's body
is now written the way it always meant, which changes nothing about what it says and everything about
what a reader sees — the field that makes it refuted is on the page instead of one lemma away. It
cannot be defined as `DomainSeparatedCREff D ⊤` because THAT module imports THIS one; the agreement
is `domainSeparatedCREff_top_iff_old`, now true by `Iff.rfl`. -/

assumed to. (`Function.Injective sponge` is the idealized-hash shape; it is unsatisfiable at real

/-! ## §4 — the connection, REBUILT (2026-07-22): the deployed consumers as SECURITY REDUCTIONS.

⚑ **WHAT WAS HERE BEFORE, AND WHY IT WENT.** This section used to export six `deployed_*_advantage_bound`
theorems of the shape

    theorem deployed_oodCommitmentOpening_advantage_bound (D) (hD : DomainSeparatedCR D)
        (opener : CollisionFinder (poseidon2KeyedFamily D))
        : Negl (collisionAdv (poseidon2KeyedFamily D) opener) :=
      FloorRegroundedConsumers.oodCommitmentOpening_advantage_bound hD opener

carrying a DOUBLE defect, both halves fatal on their own:

  1. the consumed `FloorRegroundedConsumers` bound was `P → P` — the hypothesis handed back, with the
     OOD opening named in the theorem's NAME and absent from its STATEMENT (see that file's §0); and
  2. the floor `DomainSeparatedCR D` is PROVED FALSE at deployed BabyBear parameters
     (`DomainSeparatedCREffRegrounded.domainSeparatedCR_false_babyBear`; the ⚠⚠ warning on
     `DomainSeparatedCR` above says so at length). So the whole section was vacuously true at the
     deployed hash — it transported no security to the thing it was written to be about.

The four rebuilt bounds below (2026-07-24, second rebuild) are the KEYED-ROM successors: the same
forgery — one committed root, one shared path, two distinct opened leaves — transposed to the SAMPLED
oracle keyed by the DEPLOYED sponge's own tag space (`FloorRegroundedConsumers` §2's
`merkleOpenRomBreakGame` at `toSpongeKeyed D`). The `IsPolyTime`-discharged forms that briefly stood
here carried `DeployedOpenFloor D` = `HashCRHardQuant (poseidon2KeyedFamily D) (IsPolyTime …)`, which
`Exec.SystemRootsBindingReduction.sysRoots_floor_polyTime_false_babyBear` REFUTES at the deployed
sponge — they are DELETED with their floor abbrev. The successors carry NO floor hypothesis at all:
the floor is `KeyedRomFloor.keyedRom_hard`, the birthday bound, PROVED. The ROM idealisation is the
labelled modelling step of `RomCarrierSites`' header (ideal `Fin (2 ^ l)` digest vs the deployed
~31-bit felt — the felt-width wound, said out loud, not smuggled).

⚑ **TWO OF THE SIX ARE GONE, NOT MOVED.** `deployed_recStateCommit_advantage_bound` and
`deployed_committedTrace_pinned_advantage_bound` are DELETED, because the `FloorRegroundedConsumers`
bounds they consumed are themselves BLOCKED (that file's §7 (a) and (b): the AIR trace binder is stated
over an abstract `CommitReveal` with no `ℤ`-valued deployed function, and the faithful state root's
extractor chain ends at `FaithfulBreak`, a disjunction of EXISTENTIALS with no total-function extractor).
Exporting a deployed bound for either would be asserting a reduction that does not exist.

⚑ **A MIRROR IS NAMED HERE, NOT SILENTLY FORKED.** `DomainSeparatedSponge` (§1) and
`SpongeCarrierReduction.SpongeKeyed` are FIELD-FOR-FIELD THE SAME STRUCTURE, and `poseidon2KeyedFamily`
is `spongeFamily`. `toSpongeKeyed` below converts, and `spongeFamily_toSpongeKeyed` proves the two
families are one `KeyedHashFamily` by `rfl` — so no drift is possible. But the right repair is to DELETE
one of the two structures, not to bridge them; that is a single-owner edit across the eight files now
using `poseidon2KeyedFamily`/`hashAt`, and is on the work-list rather than done here while those files
are being actively written by other lanes. `Dregg2.Crypto.SpongeCarrierBridge` proves the same
identification from above. -/

honest price of every `hEff` discharge above, at the deployed family. This is why the rebuilt bounds are
stated at `IsPolyTime` and not at `⊤`: at `⊤` the floor is the EXISTENCE floor, and collisions exist. -/
