# `Dregg2.Circuit.PremiseInhabitabilityConclusionAxis` — the TEN remaining carrier-gated kernels,
settled on the CONCLUSION axis.

`PremiseInhabitabilitySweepSettled` §9 found a THIRD vacuity mode that `CarrierLive` cannot see: if a
gated theorem's conclusion is TOTAL — true on every index — the theorem holds with the carrier AND
the acceptance hypothesis deleted, while the axiom audit stays clean and no `sorry` exists. It fired
that check at THREE of R11's thirteen carrier-gated kernels (`NonMembership` MODE 3 permanently,
`Merkle` MODE 3 at the reference node hash, `Temporal` NOT MODE 3) and named the remaining ten as
ENGINEERING: "one exhibited counterexample or one totality proof each".

This module is that engineering pass. All TEN are settled here as theorems:
`PortalFloor`, `Pedersen`, `Custom`, `Deco`, `Dfa`, `DfaAcceptanceAir`, `Cfg`, `Bridge`,
`BlindedSet`, `RangeProof`.

## §A the headline

**THREE MORE ARE MODE 3, all at their own IN-TREE reference instance** — and each one is the
`∃-image` shape: the conclusion asks for a preimage under an operation the reference instance makes
SURJECTIVE, so the existential is discharged by algebra with no proof in sight.

  * `Custom` — `custom_verify_sound`'s `∃ wit, R.Relation stmt wit` at the in-tree `eqRegistration`
    (`Relation stmt wit := stmt = wit`) is `∃ wit, stmt = wit`. TOTAL, witness `stmt`. The module's
    own non-vacuity example (`Custom.lean:353`) is that tautology. §3.
  * `Bridge` — `∃ v vDigest salt, c = compress vDigest salt ∧ threshold ≤ v` at
    `refCompress := (· + ·)`: take `vDigest := c`, `salt := 0`, `v := threshold`. TOTAL. §8.
  * `BlindedSet` — `∃ member, MerkleMembers compress root member` at `refCompress := (· + ·)`:
    the member is existential TOO, so this is weaker than the Merkle conclusion §9.3 already
    refuted. TOTAL. §9.

So MODE 3 now stands at FIVE of thirteen, and in every case the polarity INVERTS exactly as §9.3
found at Merkle: the REFERENCE instance is the vacuous one and the FORGE sibling — the broken oracle
the carrier repair uses as its refutation witness — is the one whose conclusion BITES.

**SEVEN are NOT MODE 3**, and SIX of those are refuted at EVERY instantiation — the counterexample
is a disclosed STATEMENT, so no oracle, no carrier and no deployment can repair it:

  * `Pedersen` (§2) — a disclosed statement whose commitment sums differ, at any `commit`.
  * `Deco` (§4) — a statement with `amountCents = 0`, at any signature/MAC/hash/schema.
  * `Dfa` (§5) — an automaton whose accept predicate is empty.
  * `DfaAcceptanceAir` (§6) — a public `finalState` outside the image of the table's `step`.
  * `Cfg` (§7) — the rule-free grammar, whose language is empty.
  * `RangeProof` (§10) — an empty window `hi < lo`, at any `commit`.

The seventh is per-instance because its conclusion is KERNEL data rather than statement data:

  * `PortalFloor` (§1) — `Holds` is a field of the class, so the verdict is per-instance. BOTH
    in-tree instances bite; a lawful MODE-3 instantiation is exhibited so this is not read as a
    class-level clearance.

## §B what the ten checks forced into the instrument (§0)

Two refinements, both needed by a kernel below and neither expressible with `ConclusionTotal` alone:

  * **`ConclusionTotalOn S C`** — RELATIVE totality: the conclusion is free on the sub-domain a
    statement-side predicate `S` carves out. `Deco` and `RangeProof` are not MODE 3, and yet at
    their in-tree reference kernels their conclusion is derivable, carrier deleted, from a
    predicate of the DISCLOSED STATEMENT ALONE (`1 ≤ amountCents`; `lo ≤ commitment ≤ hi`). A
    verifier can evaluate that predicate itself. The gated theorem is then worth exactly `S` — which
    is not nothing, and is not what "an accepted STARK proof proves X" advertises.
  * **`CarrierIdle acc C`** — the conclusion follows from ACCEPTANCE with the carrier deleted.
    MODE 3 is the special case where acceptance goes too. This is what `RangeProof`'s reference
    kernel exhibits at full strength: its conclusion is DEFINITIONALLY its acceptance test, so
    `range_verify_sound` there is `accept → accept` and the two crypto carriers buy nothing.

And one structural observation that costs one line and re-reads the whole sibling carrier repair
(§11): **a PROVED carrier is an IDLE carrier.** Wherever `extractable` is discharged by an in-tree
theorem — which is exactly what the 2026-07-25 repair did at all eight reference kernels — the gated
theorem carries no assumption at all, so no reference instance can ever witness that the carrier is
load-bearing. That work is done entirely by the FORGE sibling refutation, and this theorem is why
`CarrierAudit`'s `refuted` field is the whole content of the repair rather than half of it.

## §C ⚑ WHAT THIS DOES NOT SETTLE

The DEPLOYMENT verdict for all thirteen is UNCHANGED and UNKNOWN, for the reason
`PremiseInhabitabilitySweepSettled` §9.6 gives: settling it needs a kernel whose `compress` is real
Poseidon2 and whose `verify` is the deployed `stark::verify`, and that symbol is `opaque`/`@[extern]`
with NO Lean semantics. Nothing here touches that. Every MODE-3 verdict below that says "at the
reference instance" is a statement about a TOY oracle; every "at every instantiation" verdict is
stronger and says so in the theorem name.

Nor does a NOT-MODE-3 verdict mean a kernel is sound: it means the conclusion excludes SOMETHING, so
the theorem is not free on the conclusion axis. The carrier axis (`CarrierAudit`) and the acceptance
axis (`CarrierLive`) are separate, and `CarrierBites` is the conjunction of all three.

/-! ## §0 — THE INSTRUMENT, EXTENDED BY WHAT THE TEN CHECKS ACTUALLY NEEDED.

`ConclusionTotal` is a yes/no question and two of the ten answer "no" while still being free in a way
that matters. The two definitions here are the shapes those kernels forced. -/

/-- **`ConclusionTotalOn S C`** — the conclusion holds everywhere a STATEMENT-SIDE predicate `S`
holds. `ConclusionTotal` is `ConclusionTotalOn (fun _ => True)`. -/
def ConclusionTotalOn {ι : Type u} (S C : ι → Prop) : Prop := ∀ i, S i → C i

/-- **RELATIVE MODE 3.** On the sub-domain `S`, the gated theorem is free: carrier deleted,
acceptance deleted. If `S` is decidable from the disclosed statement, the theorem delivers exactly
`S` — whatever its name advertises. -/
theorem totalOn_makes_the_gated_theorem_free_on_S {ι : Type u} (carrier : Prop) (acc : Acc ι)
    {S C : ι → Prop} (h : ConclusionTotalOn S C) : carrier → ∀ i, S i → acc i → C i :=
  fun _ i hs _ => h i hs

theorem conclusionTotal_of_totalOn_true {ι : Type u} {C : ι → Prop}
    (h : ConclusionTotalOn (fun _ => True) C) : ConclusionTotal C := fun i => h i trivial

/-- **`CarrierIdle acc C`** — the conclusion follows from ACCEPTANCE ALONE, with the carrier
deleted. Strictly weaker than MODE 3 (which deletes acceptance too) and strictly stronger than
nothing: it says the `extractable` `Prop` — the whole cryptographic trust boundary the class exists
to name — is doing no work at this instantiation. -/
def CarrierIdle {ι : Type u} (acc : Acc ι) (C : ι → Prop) : Prop := ∀ i, acc i → C i

/-- MODE 3 implies the carrier is idle: deleting acceptance as well is more, not less. -/
theorem carrierIdle_of_conclusionTotal {ι : Type u} {acc : Acc ι} {C : ι → Prop}

    {acc : Acc ι} {C : ι → Prop} (h : CarrierIdle acc C) : carrier → ∀ i, acc i → C i :=
  fun _ i hi => h i hi

/-- …and `CarrierIdle` is STRICTLY weaker than `ConclusionTotal`: the accept-`0`-only predicate on
`ℕ` with `C := (· = 0)` has an idle carrier and a conclusion that BITES. So a NOT-MODE-3 verdict does
NOT rescue a carrier from idleness, which is why §4 and §10 report both. -/

  exact of_decide_eq_true hi

/-! ## §1 — `PortalFloor.VerifierKernel`: NOT MODE 3 at either in-tree instance.

`verifier_floor_sound`'s conclusion is `K.Holds stmt` for a `Holds : Stmt → Prop` the INSTANCE
supplies, so no class-level verdict exists — and unlike `Custom` and `Cfg` (whose parametricity §3
and §7 also face) this class has TWO concrete in-tree instances, so the per-instance question is
answerable at both. Both BITE. The parametric escape is exhibited too, so the reading is
"this class's verdict is per-instance and both its instances pass", not "this class is safe". -/

section PortalFloorRow

open Dregg2.Crypto.PortalFloor

/-- **THE REFERENCE INSTANCE BITES.** `Holds stmt := stmt = 0` fails at `stmt = 1`, so the STARK
floor's conclusion excludes something at the instance the tree ships. -/

  exact absurd h' (by decide)

/-- **AND SO DOES THE FORGE INSTANCE** — `Holds _ := False` bites everywhere. Note the polarity here
is NOT the Merkle/Bridge/BlindedSet inversion: at this class both siblings are informative on the
conclusion axis, and the carrier axis is what separates them
(`instVerifierKernel_extractable` vs `instVerifierForge_not_extractable`). -/

    ConclusionBites (fun s : Nat => (Reference.instVerifierForge).Holds s) :=

  Holds _ := True

  extractable := True
  verify_sound := fun _ _ _ _ => trivial

/-- **THE PARAMETRIC ESCAPE, EXHIBITED.** At `totalHoldsKernel` the floor's conclusion is TOTAL and
`verifier_floor_sound` holds with the carrier and acceptance deleted — while `CarrierLive` reports
green (the carrier is `True` and the verifier accepts every proof). So §1's verdict is a statement
about the two in-tree instances and not about the class. -/

end PortalFloorRow

/-! ## §2 — `PedersenVerifierKernel`: NOT MODE 3 at EVERY instantiation.

`pedersen_verify_sound` concludes `∃ circuit, statementOf commit circuit = stmt ∧ Conserves circuit`.
The `statementOf` equation pins the trace's per-note commitments to the DISCLOSED lists, and
`Conserves`'s first conjunct equates their group sums — so the conclusion FORCES a relation between
two public fields of the statement. That is what a non-total conclusion looks like, and it holds at
every `commit`, every `Digest`, and every kernel: no toy oracle and no deployment can make this one
free. -/

/-! ## §3 — `CustomVerifierKernel`: **MODE 3 AT THE IN-TREE REFERENCE REGISTRATION.**

`custom_verify_sound` concludes `∃ wit, R.Relation stmt wit`, parametric in the registration — so
`PremiseInhabitabilitySweepSettled` §9.6 recorded it as "whatever the registration says". That is
right about the class and it is not the end of the question, because the tree SHIPS a registration:
`Reference.eqRegistration`, whose relation is `stmt = wit` over `ℤ`. `∃ wit, stmt = wit` is a
tautology of equality — witness `stmt` — so the conclusion is TOTAL and `custom_verify_sound` is
free at the only registration anyone has written down.

And the polarity inverts exactly as it does at Merkle: at the FORGE registration (`Relation` = the
empty relation, the sibling whose carrier the repair REFUTES) the conclusion bites everywhere. -/

/-! ## §4 — `DecoVerifierKernel`: NOT MODE 3 at every instantiation, and RELATIVELY total at the
reference kernel.

`deco_verify_sound` concludes `∃ w, DecoRelation … stmt w`. Conjunct (5) of `DecoRelation` is
`1 ≤ stmt.facts.amountCents` — a predicate of the DISCLOSED STATEMENT with no witness in it — so the
existential cannot escape it and the conclusion BITES at every zero-amount statement, at every
oracle choice. That settles MODE 3 negatively, universally.

It does not settle what the theorem is WORTH, and the answer at the in-tree reference kernel is:
exactly conjunct (5). `refKernel_extractable`'s own proof builds its satisfying trace from the
amount hypothesis alone (the session key is echoed, the MAC oracle accepts everything, the opening is
canonical) — so the conclusion is derivable, carrier deleted, from `1 ≤ amountCents`, which the
verifier can evaluate itself. `ConclusionTotalOn` is the shape of that reading. -/

/-! ## §5 — `DfaVerifierKernel`: NOT MODE 3 at every instantiation.

`dfa_verify_sound` concludes `∃ trace, DfaAccepts stmt.δ stmt.q₀ stmt.accept trace`. The existential
is over the whole run, which is what makes MODE 3 plausible here — but `DfaAccepts` demands a
NON-EMPTY trace whose last `next` is ACCEPTING, so the conclusion forces the disclosed automaton to
have a reachable accepting state. At an automaton that accepts nothing there is no such trace. -/

/-! ## §6 — `DfaAirVerifierKernel`: NOT MODE 3 at every instantiation.

`dfaAir_verify_sound` concludes `∃ rows, Satisfies … rows ∧ finalState = classify d (symbols rows)`.
`Satisfies` demands a NON-EMPTY row list whose last row's `next` is the public `finalState` (B2) and
whose every row's `next` is a table cell `d.step state sym` (TABLE). So the conclusion forces the
public `finalState` into the IMAGE of the disclosed table — refutable at any DFA that never reaches
the claimed classification. -/

`bridge_verify_sound` concludes

ONLY in `threshold ≤ v`, which `v := threshold` discharges — so the whole conclusion collapses to
"the disclosed commitment `c` is in the IMAGE of `compress`". That is the `∃-image` shape, and at the
reference node hash `refCompress := (· + ·)` the image is everything.

sibling whose carrier the repair REFUTES is the one whose conclusion says something. -/

`range_verify_sound` concludes `∃ v r, commit v r = commitment ∧ InRange lo hi v`. `InRange` is
`lo ≤ v ∧ v ≤ hi`, so an EMPTY window refutes it whatever the commitment scheme: NOT MODE 3, at
every instantiation, exactly as `Temporal` (§9.4's control) fails at `lo = 1, hi = 0`.

What that yes/no answer hides is visible with `ConclusionTotalOn` and `CarrierIdle`. The in-tree
reference kernel sets `refCommit v r := v` — the commitment IS the value — so the conclusion is
LOGICALLY EQUIVALENT to `lo ≤ commitment ≤ hi`, which is verbatim the reference verifier's own
decidable acceptance test. `range_verify_sound` there is `accept → accept`, and BOTH crypto carriers
(`extractable`, `binding`) are idle. -/

The 2026-07-25 carrier repair replaced `extractable := True` with an extractability-SHAPED `Prop` at
eight reference kernels and PROVED it at each (`*_extractable`). That is a real improvement on the
carrier axis — but it cannot, even in principle, demonstrate at those instances that the carrier is
LOAD-BEARING, because a carrier that is proved in Lean is a carrier the gated theorem does not need.
One line says so. The evidence that the carrier has content therefore lives ENTIRELY in the FORGE
sibling refutation (`*forge*_not_extractable`), which is exactly `CarrierAudit`'s `refuted` field —
so that field is the whole content of the repair, not half of it. -/

**R11 after this module.** Of the thirteen carrier-gated kernels: **FIVE are MODE 3** at an in-tree
instance (`NonMembership` permanently, `Merkle`, `Custom`, `Bridge`, `BlindedSet` at their reference
oracles) and **EIGHT are not** (`Temporal`, `PortalFloor`, `Pedersen`, `Deco`, `Dfa`,
`DfaAcceptanceAir`, `Cfg`, `RangeProof`). The conclusion-axis question §9.6 left open for eleven is
CLOSED for all ten remaining; nothing on this axis is UNKNOWN any more.

**What is still UNKNOWN — and it is not effort.** The DEPLOYMENT verdict for all thirteen. Settling
it needs a kernel whose `compress` is real Poseidon2 and whose `verify` is the deployed
`stark::verify`; that symbol is `opaque`/`@[extern]` with no Lean semantics, so the object does not
exist in the tree and cannot be built by engineering. Every MODE-3 verdict here that names a
reference oracle is a statement about a TOY, and the four "at every instantiation" refutations are
the only ones that survive to a deployed instantiation — they say the conclusion is not free THERE
either, which is a lower bound on content and not a soundness claim.

**And the pattern, stated once.** Four of the five MODE-3 members are the `∃-image` shape `∃ w,
x = f w` at an instantiation where `f` is surjective — `Custom`'s `∃ wit, stmt = wit` (identity),
`Bridge`'s `∃ vD salt, c = compress vD salt`, `BlindedSet`'s and `Merkle`'s
`recompose … path = root`. The fifth, `NonMembership`, is the degenerate limit of the same shape:
its conclusion does not mention the pinned object AT ALL, so no instantiation can matter. The non-MODE-3 members are exactly those whose
conclusion retains a conjunct over PUBLIC data that no witness can supply (`Pedersen`'s sum
equation, `Deco`'s amount, `Dfa`'s accept set, `DfaAcceptanceAir`'s table image, `Cfg`'s language,
`RangeProof`'s and `Temporal`'s window). That is a usable design rule: a gated conclusion is free
exactly when its every conjunct is existentially reachable. -/

this rather than letting the sweep's table drift out of sync with the tree. Order matches §12. -/
