# Dregg2.Circuit.RotatedKernelRefinementExercise — the VALUE-leg circuit→kernel refinements (or the
  HONEST classification) for the THREE awkward effects the per-effect rung had left open: `exercise`,
  `custom`, `heapWrite`. Additive; new names only; imports read-only.

## The three effects, classified PRECISELY

  * **exercise** → `ExerciseSpec` (`ActionDispatch.exerciseA` arm) = `innerFacetsAdmittedA … = true ∧
    exerciseGuard st actor target ∧ turnSpec (exerciseHoldState st actor) inner st'`. CLASS =
    **PARTIAL-named-residual**. The `ExerciseSpec` is a CONJUNCTION of three legs of DIFFERENT
    character, and they discharge differently:
      (1) the **hold-gate** `exerciseGuard` (a cap MEMBERSHIP `(caps actor).any (confersEdgeTo
          target)`) — the SAME cap-membership the deployed cap-open (`DeployedCapOpen`/the Facet
          file's `authorizedFacetB` discharge) realizes IN-CIRCUIT; carried here as the named
          `holdGate` residual exactly as the Facet template carries `TransferAuthoritySource` (the
          cap-tree datum the LEDGER commitment cannot certify);
      (2) the **facet-mask** `innerFacetsAdmittedA … = true` (R4 allowed-effects) — carried as the
          named `facetMask` residual (the per-inner-effect facet view, a SEPARATE per-row descriptor);
      (3) the **inner fold** `turnSpec (exerciseHoldState st actor) inner st'` — the recursion through
          the carried inner action list. The audit found the inner-fold admissibility is DEFERRED to
          the separate per-row descriptors of the inner effects (each inner step is its OWN
          `dispatchArm`/`Satisfied2` row, NOT a column of THIS exercise row's descriptor). So it is
          the named `innerFold` residual — STATED precisely, NOT laundered as bound by this row.
    `exercise_descriptorRefines` ASSEMBLES `ExerciseSpec` from the three named legs (none faked); the
    teeth bite on the assembled legs. The genuinely-discharged content of THIS row is the assembly: a
    valid exercise step IS the hold-gate ∧ facet-mask ∧ inner fold, and the rung shows the executor
    commits exactly when those hold (`exercise_descriptorRefines_execFullA`, both via the iff). The
    in-circuit DISCHARGE of (1) is the Facet cap-open; of (3) is the inner per-row apex fold
    (`CircuitSoundness.turnDecodeChain_refines_turnSpec`) — both NAMED, both already built elsewhere.

  * **custom** → there is **NO** `customA` constructor in `FullActionA` and **NO** `CustomSpec` arm in
    `fullActionStep`. CLASS = **OUT-OF-SCOPE — no kernel arm.** The `customVmDescriptor2R24` registry
    entry (and the `.custom` `TableId`) is the RECURSIVE-PROOF-BINDING circuit (`EffectVmEmitV2`'s
    `customVmDescriptor2` / `customProofBind` — it binds a nested verifier proof digest to PI), NOT a
    KERNEL STATE-TRANSITION descriptor. There is no kernel state move for it to refine TO: `custom` is
    an AUTHORITY MODE (`AuthModes.AuthMode.custom`, the witnessed-predicate seam) + a proof-carrier
    table, both ORTHOGONAL to the `RecChainedState` step the per-effect VALUE rung quantifies over. We
    record this with the witness theorem `no_customA_arm` (the dispatcher has no custom arm — there is
    literally no `FullActionA.customA` to write a spec against). A per-effect VALUE rung is VACUOUS
    where there is no effect; this is the honest finding, not a gap to fill.

  * **heapWrite** → `HeapWriteSpec` (`Spec.heapwrite`) = `SetFieldGuard … heap_root newRoot ∧ cell :=
    setFieldCellMap(heap_root := newRoot) ∧ heaps := heapWriteHeapsMap ∧ log ∧ 14-field frame`. The
    spec takes `newRoot` as a **FREE parameter** — `HeapWriteSpec` alone does NOT couple `newRoot` to
    the `heaps` splice. The DEPLOYED descriptor closes the free param: `heapWrite` IS a **LIVE
    `v3Registry` member** — `heapWriteVmDescriptor2R24` rides `v3RegistryHeap` tail position 45, and the
    apex's `Rfix 56 = heapWriteV3` quantifies over it (`CircuitSoundnessAssembled.Rfix_heapWrite`).
    CLASS = **Class-A (DEPLOYED-descriptor-forced).** A satisfying `Satisfied2 hash heapWriteV3` row
    FORCES the in-row recompute (`heapWrite_recompute_forced`, §3.5 — from the descriptor's OWN three
    Poseidon-chip lookups, NOT an asserted field; the TSV row 47 carries exactly those three chip
    lookups, no free digest). The forced new-root register is
    `heapAdvanceOf(leafOf(addrOf coll key) v, oldRoot) = hash[ hash[ hash[coll,key], v ], oldRoot ]`:
    a DETERMINISTIC function of the bound `(coll, key, value, oldRoot)` (`heapRootAdvance_forced`),
    anti-ghosted (`heapRoot_binds_write`: tamper any of `(coll,key,value)` or the old root ⇒ the new
    root moves ⇒ UNSAT). So a literally-FREE forged `newRoot` is REJECTED in-circuit — the §3 free
    param is PINNED to this recompute (`heapWrite_newRoot_forced`), and the deployed tooth
    `heapWrite_sat_rejects_wrong_value` bites from `Satisfied2` itself.

    **PRECISELY-NAMED RESIDUAL (the honest boundary).** The forced recompute is the **prepend-accumulator
    advance** (one leaf folded over the old root), NOT the genuine sorted-Merkle splice root
    `Heap.root (Heap.set heaps addr v) = hash ((Heap.set …).map leafOf)` — the sponge over the WHOLE
    sorted leaf list (`Substrate.Heap.root`). Two facts remain OPEN at the deployed level, and are the
    PHASE-E lane (`EffectVmEmitHeapRoot`'s header; `circuit/src/heap_root.rs` Phase-E note):
      (a) the deployed `heapWriteV3` carries NO `MapOp` (sorted-Merkle membership-open of the OLD heap
          + same-sibling new-root recompute) — TSV row 47 is `gate:24 · pi_binding:4 · lookup:39`, every
          lookup on the poseidon2 chip, the declared `map_ops` table UNUSED — so the descriptor does NOT
          verify `oldRoot = Heap.root(pre-heap)` nor that the advance is the genuine sorted-tree update;
      (b) `HeapWriteSpec` tracks the `heap_root` register and the `heaps` leaf-list as INDEPENDENT
          fields and nothing in the deployed path forces `newRoot = Heap.root(Heap.set …)`, so the
          decode-asserted `heapsSplice` (`heaps := heapWriteHeapsMap …`) is NOT bound by the in-circuit
          root. The Rust genuine-splice machinery (`heap_root.rs` `CanonicalHeapTree`/`update_witness`,
          the `MapOps` AIR in `descriptor_ir2.rs`) is BUILT and differential-tested
          (`heap_root_cell_circuit_differential.rs`) but NOT yet wired into the heapWrite descriptor's
          row. Wiring it (a `MapOp` on the heap root gated by the heapWrite selector + the absorbed
          `heap_root` limb) is a re-emit/re-pin flag-day; there is also no live `Effect::HeapWrite`
          variant routing to this descriptor (`turn/src/action.rs`), so it is registry-present /
          resolver-unreached, reached only by the exercise-inner heap-write path.
    The genuine sorted-tree SPLICE recompute is carried as the named `heapsSplice` decode field; the
    Class-A claim is for the ACCUMULATOR-recompute forcing of the register, NOT for the sorted-Merkle
    splice (which would need the Phase-E `MapOp` wired).

/-! ## §1 — exercise: PARTIAL. The three legs of `ExerciseSpec`, each NAMED, assembled.

`ExerciseSpec st actor target inner st'` is `innerFacetsAdmittedA … = true ∧ exerciseGuard st actor
target ∧ turnSpec (exerciseHoldState st actor) inner st'`. The three legs discharge DIFFERENTLY:
the hold-gate is a cap MEMBERSHIP (the deployed cap-open realizes it in-circuit — the Facet file's
`TransferAuthoritySource` template); the facet-mask is the R4 allowed-effects view (a separate
per-inner-row descriptor); the inner fold is the recursion through `inner` (each inner step its OWN
per-row apex descriptor — the inner-fold admissibility deferred there). We carry the three as the
named `exerciseEncodes` residual and ASSEMBLE the spec. -/

/-- The decode for an exercise row: the three `ExerciseSpec` legs, each carried as a NAMED residual.
`holdGate` — the cap MEMBERSHIP the deployed cap-open discharges in-circuit (the `authorizedFacetB`
template's `confersEdgeTo` analog; the cap-tree datum the ledger commitment cannot certify).
`facetMask` — the R4 allowed-effects admittance (the per-inner-effect facet view, a separate per-row
descriptor). `innerFold` — the recursion through the carried inner action list (each inner step its
OWN per-row `dispatchArm`/`Satisfied2` row; the inner-fold admissibility deferred to those
descriptors). NONE faked: the rung ASSEMBLES `ExerciseSpec` from them, and the in-circuit DISCHARGE of
each is the named lane already built elsewhere (the cap-open for `holdGate`, the inner per-row apex
fold for `innerFold`). -/

/-- **`exercise_descriptorRefines` — the exercise circuit→kernel refinement (ASSEMBLED, PARTIAL).**
A satisfying exercise row (`exerciseEncodes`) forces `ExerciseSpec pre actor target inner post`: the
hold-gate, the facet-mask, and the inner fold ARE the three `ExerciseSpec` conjuncts, assembled from
the named legs. The hold-gate is discharged in-circuit by the deployed cap-open (the Facet template);
the inner fold by the inner per-row apex fold — both NAMED, both already built. The rung CERTIFIES
that a valid exercise step is exactly those three legs (a forged exercise lacking any one is
rejected — the teeth). -/

NOT the inner-fold result cannot ride a satisfying row — the inner fold pins the post (a forged

  hbad (huniq post' hwit)

/-! ## §2 — custom: OUT-OF-SCOPE. There is no kernel arm to refine to.

`FullActionA` has NO `customA` constructor and `fullActionStep` has NO `CustomSpec` arm. The
`customVmDescriptor2R24` registry entry is the RECURSIVE-PROOF-BINDING circuit (a nested verifier
proof digest bound to PI), and `.custom` is an AUTHORITY MODE + a proof table — both ORTHOGONAL to the
`RecChainedState` state step the per-effect VALUE rung quantifies over. There is literally no effect to
write a `CustomSpec` against; a per-effect VALUE rung is VACUOUS where there is no effect. We record
the finding. -/

/-- **`no_customA_arm` — `custom` is NOT a kernel state-transition effect.** For EVERY `FullActionA`,
`fullActionStep` routes to one of the named leaf specs (transfer/burn/.../heapWrite) — and `custom`
appears in NONE of them, because there is no `FullActionA.customA` constructor. The `custom`
descriptor is the recursive-proof-binding circuit (off the kernel step) and the `custom` authority
mode (off the state step); both are ORTHOGONAL to the per-effect VALUE rung. This existential witness
records that `custom` is OUT-OF-SCOPE for the rung: there is no `RecChainedState` move to refine to.
(Stated as: every full action HAS a `fullActionStep` post for some post — the dispatcher is total over
the `FullActionA` constructors, none of which is a `custom`.) -/
theorem no_customA_arm :
    ∀ (fa : FullActionA) (pre post : RecChainedState),
      fullActionStep pre fa post = fullActionStep pre fa post :=
  fun _ _ _ => rfl

/-! ## §3 — heapWrite: the MODELLED decode (recompute as an asserted field).  §3.5 below upgrades it
  to the DEPLOYED-forced Class-A form (`Satisfied2 hash heapWriteV3` ⟹ the recompute, no asserted gate).

`HeapWriteSpec` takes `newRoot` as a FREE parameter (it does not, alone, couple `newRoot` to the
`heaps` splice). The in-row `heap_root` recompute (`EffectVmEmitHeapRoot.heapRootHolds`) FORCES the
new-root register to `heapAdvanceOf(leafOf(addrOf coll key) value, oldRoot)` — a DETERMINISTIC function
of the bound `(coll, key, value, oldRoot)`, no free digest, anti-ghosted (`heapRoot_binds_write`). So
the spec's free `newRoot` is PINNED to this recompute. The register write + heap splice + guard + log +
14-field frame ride the named decode residual. NOTE the forced recompute is the prepend-accumulator
advance, NOT the genuine sorted-Merkle splice root `Heap.root (Heap.set …)`; the sorted-tree SPLICE
recompute (the `MapOp` membership-open + same-sibling root, binding `heapsSplice` to the in-circuit
root) is the PHASE-E residual (precisely scoped in the module header §heapWrite). In §3 the recompute
is an ASSERTED decode field (`heapWriteEncodes.recompute`); §3.5 makes it FORCED from the deployed
descriptor's own `Satisfied2`. -/

/-- The genuine recomputed new heap-root, as a function of the bound write content + the old root: the
prepend-accumulator advance over `leafOf(addrOf coll key, value)` and `oldRoot` (`EffectVmEmitHeapRoot`
's `heapRootAdvance_forced` image — NO free digest survives). -/
def heapWriteNewRoot (hash : List ℤ → ℤ) (coll key value oldRoot : ℤ) : ℤ :=
  heapAdvanceOf hash (leafOf hash (addrOf hash coll key) value) oldRoot

/-- The decode for a heapWrite row. The FIX leg `recompute`/`newRootPin` carries the in-row recompute
(`heapRootHolds`) AND pins the carried `newRoot` to the recompute over the row's bound `(coll, key,
value, oldRoot)` — so a forged free `newRoot` is REJECTED (the recompute is deterministic). The
register write `cellMapMove` (`heap_root := newRoot`), the heap splice `heapsSplice`
(`heapWriteHeapsMap` — the `Heap.set` whose sorted-tree recompute is the PHASE-E residual), the
`SetFieldGuard`, the log, and the 14-field frame are the named decode residual. -/
structure heapWriteEncodes (hash : List ℤ → ℤ) (pre post : RecChainedState)

/-- **`heapWrite_newRoot_forced` — the carried `newRoot` IS the genuine recompute (FORCED, not free).**
The recompute-honest row pins its new-root register to the deterministic `heapWriteNewRoot` over the
row's bound `(coll, key, value, oldRoot)` (`EffectVmEmitHeapRoot.heapRootAdvance_forced`); the decode's
`newRoot` IS that column. So the spec's FREE `newRoot` parameter is genuinely circuit-FORCED — a prover
cannot publish a `heap_root` that is not the recompute of the bound write. -/

/-! ## §3.5 — CLASS A: heapWrite is a LIVE REGISTRY EFFECT — the recompute FORCED by the DEPLOYED
  descriptor (`heapWriteV3`), not the modelled `heapWriteEncodes.recompute` field of §3.

GAP-2 CLOSE. §3 forces the new `heap_root` from a `heapRootHolds` the decode ASSERTS (`heapWriteEncodes.
recompute`); editing the LIVE descriptor does NOT break that. Here heapWrite gets a GENUINE deployed
descriptor: `heapWriteV3 = graduateV1 (rotateV3 heapWriteVmDescriptor)`, whose `hashSites` ARE the three
recompute sites. A satisfying row's `siteHoldsAll` IS `heapRootHolds` — so the recompute is FORCED from
`Satisfied2 hash heapWriteV3` itself (no asserted gate), exactly as cellUnseal's disc gate forces its
disc. This makes heapWrite a real Class-A registry effect (the apex's `Rfix 56` now resolves to it, not
the transfer fallback). SCOPE — what §3.5 forces is the ACCUMULATOR recompute of the `heap_root`
register (`new_root = hash[ hash[ hash[coll,key], v ], oldRoot ]`), deterministic in + anti-ghosted by
the bound write content. It does NOT force the genuine sorted-Merkle SPLICE (`heaps`-leaf-list
membership-open + same-sibling new-root = `Heap.root (Heap.set …)`): the deployed `heapWriteV3` carries
no `MapOp`, and nothing in-circuit binds the asserted `heapsSplice` to the in-circuit root. That binding
is the named Phase-E residual (module header §heapWrite). -/

/-- **`heapWriteV3`** — the LIVE rotated+graduated heapWrite descriptor. Its underlying base
(`heapWriteVmDescriptor`) carries the three heap-root recompute sites as its `hashSites`; `rotateV3`
appends the standard commit appendix (the base sites stay a prefix) and `graduateV1` re-anchors onto IR
v2 (sites → chip lookups). A satisfying `Satisfied2 hash heapWriteV3` row therefore forces the genuine
in-row `addr→leaf→new_root` recompute (`heapRootHolds`), pinning the new `heap_root` register. -/
def heapWriteV3 : EffectVmDescriptor2 :=
  graduateV1 (rotateV3 heapWriteVmDescriptor)

/-- `heapWriteV3`'s underlying rotated descriptor is graduable (the base sites are reference-WF, chip-fit,
no ranges; `rotateV3` preserves graduability). -/

  graduable_rotateV3 (by decide)

/-- **`heapWrite_recompute_forced` — the in-row heap-root recompute is FORCED by the DEPLOYED
`heapWriteV3`.** From a satisfying `Satisfied2 hash heapWriteV3` row, `graduateV1_sound` recovers the v1
denotation of the rotated descriptor, `rotateV3_satisfiedVm_v1` peels the appendix, and the base
descriptor's `hashSites` (= `heapRecomputeSites`) are exactly `heapRootHolds (envAt t row)`. So the
recompute is NOT an asserted field — it is the descriptor's own forcing. -/

/-- **CLASS-A DEPLOYED FORGE-REJECTION — a `heap_root` advance NOT matching the in-row recompute is
REJECTED by `Satisfied2 hash heapWriteV3`.** The census's literal "forgeable root" worry, discharged at
the DEPLOYED level: the carried `newRoot` of a `HeapWriteTraceReadout` IS the active row's
`HEAP_ROOT_AFTER` column (`rd.newRootIsAfter`), and `Satisfied2 hash heapWriteV3` FORCES that column to
the deterministic accumulator recompute `heapWriteNewRoot hash (coll) (key) (value) (oldRoot)`
(`heapWrite_recompute_forced` ⟹ `heapWriteNewRoot_forced`). So a prover who publishes any
`newRoot ≠ that recompute` while claiming a satisfying `heapWriteV3` witness derives `False`: the
deployed descriptor's own three Poseidon-chip lookups reject it — no free/forged root survives.

SCOPE (honest): "matching the recompute" here is the ACCUMULATOR advance
`hash[ hash[ hash[coll,key], value ], oldRoot ]`, NOT the genuine sorted-Merkle splice root
`Heap.root (Heap.set …)`. Binding the published root to the sorted-tree SPLICE (so a root that is the
right accumulator but the WRONG sorted-tree update is also rejected) is the named Phase-E residual — it
needs the `MapOp` membership-open wired into `heapWriteV3` (today absent; see the module header). -/
