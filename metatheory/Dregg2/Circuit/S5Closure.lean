# `Dregg2.Circuit.S5Closure` — discharging the COMPUTATIONAL half of the LightClientFusion §5 residual.

This module is ADDITIVE: it edits nothing in `Poseidon2KeyedBridge`/`LightClientFusion`/
`CommitmentReduction`. It closes the part of the §5 residual that is a genuine Lean construction and
names — precisely, as typed obligations — the part that is not.

## What §5 carried, and what is discharged here

`LightClientFusion.deployed_fooling_advantage_negl` (§5) bounds the advantage of a **supplied**
`foolingRootEquivocator D xs xs'` — the finder is an INPUT. That leaves the computational half assuming
what it should construct: the map from an actual deployed fooling to a concrete
`CollisionFinder (poseidon2KeyedFamily D)`.

Here the finder is CONSTRUCTED from a concrete colliding pair and its refutation of the keyed floor is a
STANDALONE reduction:

  * `deployed_collision_refutes_domainSepCR` — a genuine collision of `D.hashAt` at ANY tag builds the
    fixed-pair finder, whose advantage is a POSITIVE CONSTANT (`collisionAdv_pos`), contradicting
    `DomainSeparatedCR D` (`not_negl_const_pos`). The finder is a real term of the fooling data, not a
    re-assumed input.
  * `deployed_unfoolable_of_domainSepCR` — the §5 headline at the deployed surface:
    `HashCRHardQuant (poseidon2KeyedFamily D) Eff ⟹ ¬ Foolable (dVerify R) (dProduced S kstep)`,
    resting on the keyed-CR floor AT AN EXPLICIT ADVERSARY CLASS. ⚑ It used to rest on
    `DomainSeparatedCR D`, i.e. that floor at `⊤`, which is FALSE at the deployed BabyBear sponge —
    so the headline was true and vacuous. Ported 2026-07-28 with the class carried in the open and
    ONE new obligation stated rather than hidden: `hEff`, that the class contains the CONSTRUCTED
    fixed-pair equivocator `foolingRootEquivocator D xs xs'`. That is the honest price of a
    categorical `¬ Foolable` from a hash floor, and it is undischarged.
    The ONLY carried hypothesis is `hextract` — the fooling→collision EXTRACTION — which is the §5
    residual reduced to its crispest typed form (a fooling yields a colliding pair). The finder,
    advantage, and floor-refutation are all built inside, not assumed.

Non-vacuity is EVALUATED (`foolingFinder_brokenDomainSep_wins`, `foolingFinder_brokenDomainSep_adv_pos`):
a concrete fooling (the constant-`0` broken sponge, distinct pair `([0],[1])`) yields a concretely
WINNING constructed finder of positive advantage, computed — not a laundered `True`.

## The precise remaining residuals (NAMED, not forced — see §6)

The composition does NOT reach a full-strength real-params discharge, for two independent reasons this
file proves or pins:

  * **R2 — the floor object is vacuous at real params.** `poseidon2KeyedFamily D` keys by
    `Key n := fun _ => D.Tag` — a FIXED finite tag space INDEPENDENT of the security parameter `n`. So a
    hardcoded-collision finder has an `n`-independent (constant) advantage; a real Poseidon2 into BabyBear
    has collisions by pigeonhole. Hence `DomainSeparatedCR D` — the `⊤` instance, which §5's teeth are
    still stated at, because they are teeth ABOUT that pole — FORCES `D.hashAt t` injective for every
    `t` (`domainSepCR_forces_injective`) and is outright FALSE at the BabyBear field bound
    (`domainSepCR_false_babyBear`). Its only satisfying witnesses are injective sponges — the same "false
    comfort" `HashFloorHonesty` flags for the old injective floor. A real-params floor needs a key space
    that GROWS with `n`; the domain-separation tag is a label, not a growing key.
  * **R1 — the fooling→collision extraction is unmodeled (carried as `hextract`).** A deployed `Foolable`
    yields an accepting-but-unpinned run that decodes-and-pins `pi` but FAILS `kstep`; it does NOT hand
    two distinct kernels colliding on one committed root. Moreover the deployed state commitment
    `S.commit = recStateCommit` is a NESTED TREE `cmb[ compress[ compressN(leaves), compress(CH s, CH d) ],
    RH k ]` over FOUR differently-typed primitives, not a single `D.hashAt t`. A `StateBreak` is therefore
    a four-way disjunction (`SpongeCollision compressN ∨ CompressCollision cmb ∨ CompressCollision compress
    ∨ CellCollision CH`) whose carriers (`ℤ×ℤ`, `CellId×Value`, `List ℤ`) are TYPE-INCOMPATIBLE with a
    `poseidon2KeyedFamily D` collision (a `List ℤ` pair) — only the `compressN`/`SpongeCollision` leg
    matches, and only after a presentation factoring each primitive through `D.sponge` at distinct
    injective-encoded tags that the tree does not carry.

`#assert_axioms`-clean (⊆ {propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}); no `sorry`/`admit`/`native_decide`/
fresh `axiom`.

/-! ## §1 — the constructed finder and its POSITIVE advantage.

The finder is `foolingRootEquivocator` — the fixed-pair `CollisionFinder (poseidon2KeyedFamily D)` reused
from `LightClientFusion` (do not reinvent). Its win event at a tag is a genuine deployed collision
(`foolingRootEquivocator_wins_iff`), and — because the family key space `Key n = D.Tag` ignores `n` — its
advantage is CONSTANT in `n`. -/

/-- A `winProb` with at least one winning outcome over a nonempty finite space is POSITIVE. -/

  · exact_mod_cast (Fintype.card_pos (α := Ω))

/-- The finder's advantage against `poseidon2KeyedFamily D` is INDEPENDENT of the security parameter `n`
— because the family key space `Key n = D.Tag` and hash `H n` both ignore `n`. This is the fact that
makes a single hardcoded collision NON-negligible (a constant, not a `1/superpoly(n)`), and hence R2. -/

/-! ## §2 — THE STANDALONE REDUCTION: a constructed finder refutes the keyed floor. -/

/-- **THE CONSTRUCTED REFUTATION.** A genuine collision of `D.hashAt` at ANY tag gives the CONSTRUCTED
fixed-pair finder a non-negligible (positive-constant) advantage — refuting the floor AT ANY CLASS
`Eff` THAT CONTAINS THAT FINDER. The finder is `foolingRootEquivocator D xs xs'`, a real term of
`(xs, xs')`; nothing is re-assumed. ⚑ `hEff` is the whole residual: at `Eff := ⊤` it is `trivial` and
the refutation is unconditional (that is how §5's teeth use it), and at an honest restricted class it
is the real, undischarged question of whether outputting a KNOWN collision pair is efficient — which
it plainly is, but this tree has no cost model in which to say so. -/

  exact not_negl_const_pos (collisionAdv_pos D xs xs' t hne hcol) hnegl

/-! ## §3 — THE §5 HEADLINE at the deployed surface (the map DISCHARGED modulo the named extraction).

`deployed_unfoolable_of_domainSepCR : HashCRHardQuant (poseidon2KeyedFamily D) Eff ⟹
¬ Foolable (dVerify R) (dProduced S kstep)`. The deployed unfoolability RESTS on the keyed-CR floor at
an EXPLICIT class. Two carried hypotheses, both named: `hextract` — the fooling→colliding-pair
extraction (R1, §6) — and `hEff`, that `Eff` contains the constructed equivocator. Compare
`LightClientFusion.deployed_fooling_advantage_negl`, which carried a whole `CollisionFinder`: here the
finder, its advantage, and the floor-refutation are all CONSTRUCTED inside; only the raw collision
witness is carried. -/

/-- **THE §5 CLOSURE.** Under the deployed keyed collision-resistance floor at an explicit adversary
class, the named fooling→collision extraction `hextract`, and `hEff` (the class contains the
constructed equivocator), the deployed light client is UNFOOLABLE — no environment fools `dVerify R`
into accepting a non-`dProduced` state. The discharge routes any fooling through `hextract` to a
concrete colliding pair, CONSTRUCTS `foolingRootEquivocator` from it, and refutes the floor via
`deployed_collision_refutes_domainSepCR`.

⚑ **WHAT THIS COSTS AND WHY IT IS STILL THE RIGHT SHAPE (2026-07-28).** A CATEGORICAL `¬ Foolable`
from a hash floor is only available from a floor strong enough to forbid collisions outright — §5
proves exactly that (`domainSepCR_forces_injective`), and injectivity is FALSE at BabyBear. So at
`Eff := ⊤` this theorem is true with a false antecedent, which is what it was before this port. At a
restricted `Eff` the antecedent can hold, and the price moves into `hEff`, where a reader can see it.
The theorem did not get weaker; the hypothesis got HONEST. The concrete-security sibling that needs
no `hEff` at all is `DomainSeparatedCREffRegrounded.deployed_lightclientUnfoolable_advantage_bound_eff`
— it bounds the forgery ADVANTAGE rather than claiming unfoolability outright, and that is the form a
real hash can actually support. -/

/-! ## §4 — NON-VACUITY, EVALUATED: a concrete fooling → a concrete winning constructed finder.

At the broken (constant-`0`) sponge, the distinct pair `([0], [1])` is a genuine collision, and the
CONSTRUCTED finder `foolingRootEquivocator brokenDomainSep [0] [1]` wins — COMPUTED, not assumed — with
positive advantage. So the construction is real: it produces an actually-winning finder on a concrete
input. (Consistent with `Poseidon2KeyedBridge.brokenDomainSep_not_CR`, independently.) -/

/-- **EVALUATED WIN.** The constructed finder wins on the broken sponge at the deployed tag — computed. -/

    (foolingRootEquivocator brokenDomainSep ([0] : List ℤ) [1]).wins 0 () = true := by
  simp [CollisionFinder.wins, foolingRootEquivocator, poseidon2KeyedFamily, brokenDomainSep]

/-- **EVALUATED POSITIVE ADVANTAGE.** The constructed finder's advantage on the broken sponge is a
positive constant — a concrete, non-vacuous witness that the reduction produces a real winner. -/

/-! ## §5 — R2 EXPOSED: `DomainSeparatedCR D` forces injectivity and is FALSE at real params. -/

/-- **R2, part 1.** `DomainSeparatedCR D` forbids EVERY collision of `D.hashAt` at every tag — i.e. it
forces `D.hashAt t` INJECTIVE for all `t`. The keyed floor collapses to injectivity because the key does
not grow with `n`. -/

  intro xs xs' hcol
  by_contra hne
  exact deployed_collision_refutes_domainSepCR D hD xs xs' t hne hcol trivial

/-- **R2, part 2.** If the deployed sponge lands in a finite set of field elements (every real Poseidon2
into BabyBear), `D.hashAt t` is non-injective (pigeonhole), so `DomainSeparatedCR D` is FALSE — the same
disease `HashFloorHonesty.poseidon2SpongeCR_false_babyBear` proves for the injective floor. -/

    (domainSepCR_forces_injective D hD t)

/-- **R2, deployed form.** At the real BabyBear field bound (`0 ≤ · < p`), every deployed sponge refutes
`DomainSeparatedCR` — the floor object is unsatisfiable at real params; a real-params floor needs a key
space growing with the security parameter. -/
