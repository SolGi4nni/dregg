# Dregg2.Circuit.Spec.cellstatevk — INDEPENDENT full-state spec + executor⟺spec for the
  "cell-state-vk" effect family (variant: `setVKA`).

This is a LEAF spec module in the shape of `Dregg2.Circuit.Transfer` (`TransferSpec` +
`recKExec_iff_spec` + `recTransfer_correct`), but for the protocol-managed `verification_key` slot
write the live executor runs in its `.setVKA` arm
(`TurnExecutorFull.execFullA`, `:3496`):

    execFullA s (.setVKA actor cell vk)  =  stateStep s vkField actor cell (.int vk)

This is dregg1's `SetVerificationKey { cell, new_vk }` / `apply_set_verification_key`
(`apply.rs` ~:803): the upgrade-relevant VK-field write. Unlike the developer-facing `setFieldA` (which
routes through the per-slot caveat gate `stateStepGuarded`), `setVKA` writes a PROTOCOL-managed slot,
so it stays on the bare authority-gated `stateStep`.

`stateStep` (EffectsState.lean:207) commits iff its three-leg admissibility gate holds —

    stateAuthB s.kernel.caps actor cell = true   -- (1) AUTHORITY: the actor holds authority over `cell`
  ∧ cell ∈ s.kernel.accounts                      -- (2) MEMBERSHIP: `cell` is a live account
  ∧ cellLive s.kernel cell = true                 -- (3) LIVENESS: `cell`'s lifecycle admits effects (R6)

— and on commit writes the `verification_key` field of `cell` to `vk` (`writeField`, touching ONLY
that cell's `verification_key` slot) and extends the receipt chain by one self-targeted row. NO
balance move, NO cap edit: the whole regime invariant. THIS module proves the executor meets an
INDEPENDENT declarative full-state spec EXACTLY (both directions), enumerating ALL 17 kernel fields +
the `log` so no ghost field can be silently mutated.

## What is proved (the §6b corner of the spec⟺executor triangle, copied from `Transfer.lean`)

  1. `SetVKSpec s actor cell vk s'` : Prop — the INDEPENDENT declarative post-state: the three-leg
     guard ∧ the EXACT `cell`-map post-image (the `verification_key` of `cell` set to `vk`, every other
     cell's whole record untouched) ∧ EVERY OTHER kernel field (16 of them) LITERALLY unchanged ∧ the
     `log` extended by exactly the one self-targeted receipt row. No frame clause mentions `execFullA`
     / `stateStep`.

  2. `execFullA_setVK_iff_spec` : `execFullA s (.setVKA actor cell vk) = some s' ↔
     SetVKSpec s actor cell vk s'` — BOTH directions. The `→` half VALIDATES the executor: all 17
     kernel components + the `log` are checked, so a silently-mutated field would make the proof FAIL.

  3. `setVK_cellWrite_correct` — the post-state-helper validation lemma (mirrors `recTransfer_correct`):
     the `verification_key`-write helper sets `cell`'s `verification_key` to exactly `vk`, leaves
     `cell`'s conserved `balance` (a DISTINCT slot) intact, and leaves every OTHER cell's whole record
     untouched.

  4. `#assert_axioms` on every theorem — whitelist `{propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}` only.

The family has the single executable variant `setVKA`. The generic `vkStateStep_iff_spec` engine
below is re-derived LOCALLY (so this leaf is self-contained — no dependence on a sibling spec module)
and specialized to `vkField`.

/-! ## §1 — the admissibility guard `stateStep`/`setVKA` checks, as a `Prop`.

The exact conjunction in `stateStep`'s `if` (EffectsState.lean:209) — extracting it makes the
spec⟺executor proof a clean re-assembly, mirroring `Transfer.admitGuard`. -/

/-- **`setVKGuard` — the three-leg admissibility gate** the executor checks before it commits a
`setVKA`: AUTHORITY over `cell`, `cell` is a live account (MEMBERSHIP), and `cell`'s lifecycle admits
effects (LIVENESS — the R6 gate). Stated independently of the executor term. -/
def setVKGuard (s : RecChainedState) (actor cell : CellId) : Prop :=
  stateAuthB s.kernel.caps actor cell = true
  ∧ cell ∈ s.kernel.accounts
  ∧ cellLive s.kernel cell = true

/-! ## §2 — the post-state cell-map helper, validated DECLARATIVELY (not trusted).

`setVKCellMap k cell vk` is the `cell`-indexed record map a committed VK write produces: cell `cell`'s
`verification_key` slot set to `vk` (its other fields kept), every other cell whole-preserved. Written
WITHOUT the executor's `writeField` so the spec's `cell`-clause is the genuine semantics, and proved
equal to `writeField … vkField …` so the executor's actual post-cell-map meets it. -/

/-- The declarative post-cell-map of a VK write: only `cell`'s `verification_key` field moves. -/
def setVKCellMap (k : RecordKernelState) (cell : CellId) (vk : Int) : CellId → Value :=
  fun c => if c = cell then setField vkField (k.cell c) (.int vk) else k.cell c

/-- **`setVKCellMap_eq_writeField` — the helper matches the executor's `writeField`** (so the
declarative cell-clause and the executor's actual post-cell-map are the SAME function). -/
theorem setVKCellMap_eq_writeField (k : RecordKernelState) (cell : CellId) (vk : Int) :
    setVKCellMap k cell vk = (writeField k vkField cell (.int vk)).cell := by
  rfl

/-- **`setVK_cellWrite_correct` — the cell-update helper validated DECLARATIVELY** (the
`recTransfer_correct` analog). A VK write (a) sets `cell`'s `verification_key` slot to exactly `vk`,
(b) leaves `cell`'s conserved `balance` field untouched (the regime's balance-Δ=0 obligation, via the
non-interference of a DISTINCT slot — `verification_key ≠ balance`), and (c) leaves every OTHER cell's
whole record untouched. So the spec's `cell`-clause genuinely encodes write ∧ balance-frame ∧
cell-frame, rather than blindly trusting the helper. -/
theorem setVK_cellWrite_correct (k : RecordKernelState) (cell : CellId) (vk : Int) :
    fieldOf vkField (setVKCellMap k cell vk cell) = vk

/-! ## §3 — the FULL-STATE declarative spec (the INDEPENDENT reference) + executor⟺spec.

`SetVKSpec` is the COMPLETE state transition of a committed VK write, written INDEPENDENTLY of the
executor (no `execFullA`/`stateStep` term in any frame clause): the three-leg guard holds; the
post-state's `cell` map is the VK write (`setVKCellMap`, validated above); the `log` is extended by
exactly the one self-targeted receipt row; and ALL 16 non-`cell` kernel components — `accounts` `caps`
`escrows` `nullifiers` `revoked` `commitments` `bal` `queues` `swiss` `slotCaveats` `factories`
`lifecycle` `deathCert` `delegate` `delegations` `sealedBoxes` — are LITERALLY unchanged. Missing ANY
of these reintroduces a ghost, so all 17 kernel fields + the `log` are enumerated. This is the apex
reference truth the executor is proved equal to. -/

/-- **The full-state declarative spec of a committed `setVKA`** — the INDEPENDENT reference semantics.
The guard holds; the post-state's `cell` map is the VK write (every other cell whole, `cell`'s other
fields kept — see `setVK_cellWrite_correct`); the `log` is the one-row self-targeted extension; and
every one of the 16 non-`cell` kernel components is unchanged. No frame clause mentions the
executor. -/

/-- **`vkStateStep_iff_spec` — the GENERIC `stateStep` characterization (executor⟺spec, full state),
re-derived LOCALLY.** The bare `stateStep` (the engine the `.setVKA` arm runs) commits a write of
field `f`:=`v` into `s'` IFF `s'` is EXACTLY the three-leg-gated full post-state: the `cell` map is the
single-field write, the `log` is the one-row self-targeted extension, and ALL 16 other kernel
components are literally unchanged. The `→` direction VALIDATES `stateStep` — all 17 kernel components
+ the `log` are checked, so a silently mutated `bal`/`nullifiers`/`caps`/… would make the frame clauses
FAIL; the `←` reconstructs the committed state from the spec. The `setVKA` theorem below is a clean
instance of this. -/

/-! ## §4 — corollaries: the projections onto the touched component + the balance/cap frame.

These are the cell-state-vk analogs of `Transfer`'s debit/credit/conservation facts: a committed VK
write leaves the conserved balance untouched (regime balance-Δ=0) and the cap-graph untouched (no
authority amplification), with the `verification_key` slot set to exactly `vk`. Each is a clean read

A spec that the executor meets vacuously (because the arm accepts everything) is worthless. These
