# Dregg2.Circuit.Spec.supplycreation — INDEPENDENT full-state spec + executor⟺spec for the
dregg2 effect family **supply-creation** (variant: `mintA` — W1: the ISSUER-MOVE).

This is a *leaf* module in the `Transfer.lean` lineage: it builds, for the per-asset privileged
MINT effect, the SAME triangle corner the reference `TransferSpec`/`recKExec_iff_spec` establish
for `Transfer`, but written INDEPENDENTLY of the executor.

**W1 (DREGG3 §2.2 Asset)**: `AssetId := CellId` — the asset IS its issuer cell. A committed mint is
an ordinary per-asset transfer FROM the issuer's negative-capable well TO the recipient: the supply
increment lands ON the ledger (in the well), so `Σ_c bal c a` is EXACTLY unchanged. The deliverables,
mirroring the reference pattern (`Dregg2/Circuit/Transfer.lean` §6b):

  1. `MintASpec st t st'` : Prop — the FULL declarative post-state of a committed `mintA`. It is
     the conjunction of
       * the admissibility guard `mintAuthorizedB caps actor a ∧ 0 ≤ amt ∧ a ∈ accounts ∧
         cell ∈ accounts ∧ a ≠ cell` (the EXACT `recKMintAsset` `if`, read off the CODE — the gate
         target is the ISSUER `a`, the production law E2; `a ∈ accounts` is the genesis-order gate);
       * the EXACT touched components — `kernel.bal` is the `recTransferBal … a cell a amt`
         issuer-move write and the receipt `log` prepended with the truthful well→recipient turn
         `{actor, src:=a, dst:=cell, amt}`;
       * EVERY OTHER state component LITERALLY unchanged — the FRAME. No frame clause mentions any
         executor helper.
  2. `execMintA_iff_spec : execFullA st (.mintA actor cell a amt) = some st' ↔ MintASpec …` — BOTH
     directions. The `→` VALIDATES the executor against the independent spec: a silently-mutated
     field would make the frame clause unprovable.
  3. `recTransferBal_mint_correct` — the post-`bal` helper validated DECLARATIVELY (the issuer's
     well debited by `amt`, the recipient credited by `amt`, every other (cell,asset) entry
     literally preserved), so the spec's `bal = recTransferBal …` clause encodes
     debit ∧ credit ∧ ledger-frame, not blind trust.

The supply-creation family on `execFullA` is `mintA` (and its §8-portal twin `bridgeMintA`, which
dispatches to the SAME `recCMintAsset` — a corollary, `execBridgeMintA_iff_spec`, is included; W1:
the bridge cell IS the issuer of the bridged asset). The companion conservation corollary
`mintA_supply_delta` pins the W1 semantic content: a committed mint leaves EVERY asset's supply
EXACTLY unchanged — exactness, not disclosure.

/-! ## §1 — the admissibility guard, lifted from the CODE.

`recKMintAsset` commits IFF this exact conjunction holds. The gate target is the **ISSUER** cell
`a` (W1/E2: `mintAuthorizedB caps actor a` — the privileged `node`/`control` cap over the asset's
issuer; authority to mint IS the issuer capability, never a recipient-shaped grant). `a ∈ accounts`
is the genesis-order gate (the issuer well must be live before its asset circulates); `a ≠ cell`
rejects the self-mint no-move; there is deliberately NO availability gate at the well (E1 — the
well is negative-capable, its balance IS −supply). -/

/-- **`mintAdmit`** — the full admissibility guard `recKMintAsset`/`recCMintAsset` checks, as a
`Prop` (the conjunction in the executor's `if`). ISSUER authority ∧ non-negativity ∧ issuer-well
membership ∧ recipient membership ∧ distinctness ∧ **issuer-well LIFECYCLE-LIVENESS**. The last leg
is the "Destroyed is terminal" gate: membership (`a ∈ accounts`) is the genesis-order tooth, but a
cell can be a member AND Destroyed; minting from a Destroyed issuer well is REFUSED
(`cellLifecycleLive k a` = dregg1's `CellLifecycle::accepts_effects`). -/
def mintAdmit (k : RecordKernelState) (actor cell : CellId) (a : AssetId) (amt : ℤ) : Prop :=
  mintAuthorizedB k.caps actor a = true ∧ 0 ≤ amt
    ∧ a ∈ k.accounts ∧ cell ∈ k.accounts ∧ a ≠ cell ∧ cellLifecycleLive k a = true

/-- The truthful receipt a committed `mintA` prepends to the log: the issuer-move row
`well a → recipient cell` of size `amt` — exactly `recCMintAsset`'s `log` head. -/
def mintReceipt (actor cell : CellId) (a : AssetId) (amt : ℤ) : Turn :=
  { actor := actor, src := a, dst := cell, amt := amt }

/-! ## §2 — the post-`bal` helper, validated DECLARATIVELY.

`recTransferBal bal a cell a amt` (the issuer-move write) is the ONLY thing a committed mint does
to the ledger. We validate it relationally (the well debited, the recipient credited, every other
entry preserved) so the spec's `bal = recTransferBal …` clause carries real meaning rather than
trusting the helper's name. -/

/-- **`recTransferBal_mint_correct`** — the issuer-move ledger write validated DECLARATIVELY (for
`a ≠ cell`, the committed case): the issuer's well `(a, a)` is debited by exactly `amt`, the
recipient `(cell, a)` is credited by exactly `amt`, and every OTHER (cell,asset) entry is literally
untouched. Debit ∧ credit ∧ ledger-frame. -/

/-! ## §4 — FULL-STATE SEMANTIC SPEC (the INDEPENDENT reference) + executor⟺spec.

`MintASpec` is the COMPLETE declarative post-state of a committed `mintA`, written INDEPENDENTLY of
the executor: the guard holds; the post `kernel.bal` is the issuer-move write; the post `log` is
the truthful receipt prepended; and ALL non-`bal` kernel components are LITERALLY unchanged. No
frame clause mentions `execFullA`/`recCMintAsset`/`recKMintAsset`. -/

/-- **`recCMintAsset_iff_spec` — CHAINED EXECUTOR ⟺ SPEC (FULL state, both directions).** The
chained record kernel commits a `mintA` into `st'` IFF `st'` is EXACTLY the spec'd full post-state.
The `→` VALIDATES `recCMintAsset` against the independent spec — all 18 components
(`bal` + `log` + 16 frame fields) are checked, so a silently-mutated component would make the proof
FAIL; the `←` reconstructs the committed state from the spec. -/

directions).** The one gated executor commits a `mintA` turn into `st'` IFF `st'` is EXACTLY the
independent full-state spec. Forward VALIDATES the executor (every one of the 18 components is
pinned); backward reconstructs. This is the supply-creation corner of the

/-! ## §4b — the §8-portal twin `bridgeMintA` is the SAME effect (a corollary).

`execFullA`'s `bridgeMintA` arm dispatches to the SAME `recCMintAsset` verbatim (the §8 CryptoPortal
hypothesis is carried on the conservation keystone, not re-checked here). W1: the bridge cell IS the
issuer of the bridged asset — its well carries −(outstanding bridged supply). So the supply-creation
spec characterizes `bridgeMintA` IDENTICALLY. -/

/-! ## §6 — NON-VACUITY: the spec is a genuine GATE (rejects bad inputs).

A spec that accepts everything is worthless. `execFullA` REJECTS an unauthorized mint, a
negative-amount mint, a mint whose issuer well is dead (the genesis-order tooth), a mint to a dead
recipient, and the self-mint — each makes the guard FALSE, hence the executor returns `none` and
