# `Dregg2.Circuit.SpongeForgeReduction` — the DEPLOYED sponge-digest bindings, as SECURITY REDUCTIONS.

## The sin this module retires, at its root

Across the circuit tower ~20 exported bindings had the shape

    theorem foo_binds (hCR : Poseidon2SpongeCR sponge) {a b} (h : digest a = digest b) : a = b

`Poseidon2SpongeCR sponge := ∀ xs ys, sponge xs = sponge ys → xs = ys` is INJECTIVITY of a map from
the infinite `List ℤ` into a bounded BabyBear field element. It is PROVED FALSE at deployed parameters
(`HashFloorHonesty.poseidon2SpongeCR_false_babyBear`), so every such theorem is **VACUOUSLY TRUE at
the deployed hash** — clean `#assert_axioms`, zero transported security. `StateCommit.compressNInjective`
is literally the same predicate, refuted by the same tooth (`compressNInjective_false_of_finite_range`).

The cure is NOT a `binds ∨ collides` disjunction. That is true at deployed parameters, but a collision
EXISTS there by pigeonhole, so the disjunction is satisfiable through the `collides` branch WITHOUT
`binds` ever holding: it quantifies over SOLUTIONS, where cryptographic hardness quantifies over
EFFICIENT ADVERSARIES. The cure is the standard one:

  * the forgery is a first-class `FloorGames.Game` (the deployed digest equivocation IS the win
    relation, at a uniformly sampled domain-separation tag),
  * the extractor is a MAP OF ADVERSARIES into the deployed sponge's collision game,
  * the advantage inequality is UNCONDITIONAL — it quantifies over ALL adversaries, the class `Eff`
    does NOT appear in it,
  * the security conclusion is `Negl` under the NAMED floor
    `DomainSeparatedCREffRegrounded.DomainSeparatedCREff D Eff`
    = `FloorGames.HashCRHardQuant (poseidon2KeyedFamily D) Eff`,
  * and `Eff` is instantiated at `CostAdversary.IsPolyTime`, where the efficiency obligation is
    DISCHARGED by `CostTactics.poly_time` rather than carried as a floating parameter.

## What this module is

The GENERIC layer, so the ~20 sites do not each re-derive it. Every deployed site absorbs a `List ℤ`
CODE of its own object and publishes the sponge of it; the only per-site data is that code. So:

  * **§1** `codeForgeGame D A code` — the forgery game at an arbitrary domain `A` with an absorption
    code `code : A → List ℤ`. The adversary wins iff it outputs two objects whose CODES DIFFER yet
    whose domain-separated sponge digests AGREE at the sampled tag. `codeForgeGame_wins_iff` pins that
    the problem is in the statement; `deployed_forgery_is_break` ties a deployed-tag equivocation of
    the real function to a game win.
  * **§2** `codeForgeToFinder` — the extractor as a map of adversaries (a pure output reshaping: read
    off the two codes). `code_wins_imp` / `code_adv_le` — win-preservation and the UNCONDITIONAL
    advantage inequality.
  * **§3** `codeForge_advantage_bound` — the reduction under the named floor at an arbitrary class.
  * **§4** the answer-size cost model (`codeAnsSize`/`hashAnsSize`, `codeForge_out_le`) — the honest
    record of what that model can price. ⚑ The `IsPolyTime` discharge that stood here
    (`codeForge_binds_from_polyTime`) is DELETED (07-24): its floor
    `DomainSeparatedCREff D (IsPolyTime …)` is REFUTED at deployed parameters
    (`Exec.SystemRootsBindingReduction.sysRoots_floor_polyTime_false_babyBear` — `IsPolyTime` prices
    answer SIZE, so a `.pure` answerer with a hardcoded short collision is in the class and wins with
    probability `1`). The DISCHARGED successor is **§8**: `codeForge_binds_rom` on the PROVED
    keyed-ROM floor (`KeyedRomFloor.keyedRom_hard`, the birthday bound), with the forger an ORACLE
    PROGRAM and the site's bounded in-range code embedded LOSSLESSLY into the finite message shape
    (`intListBVec_inj`).
  * **§5** the poles, PRICED: `⊤` FALSE at the deployed BabyBear sponge, `⊥` vacuous, the class at
    `IsPolyTime` INHABITED, and the canary that the bound does not follow from the floor at another
    finder.
  * **§6** `injective_code_forgery_is_break` — the bridge every site with an INJECTIVE code uses: an
    equivocation of the site's OBJECTS is a game win, because distinct objects have distinct codes.

## ⚑ ONE CARRIER, ONE FLOOR — no mirror

An earlier revision of this module declared its OWN `DeployedSponge` / `spongeFamily` /
`DeployedSpongeCRHard` — field-for-field the same objects as `Poseidon2KeyedBridge`'s
`DomainSeparatedSponge` / `poseidon2KeyedFamily` and `DomainSeparatedCREffRegrounded`'s
`DomainSeparatedCREff`. That mirror is DELETED, not bridged: this module is typed directly over
`Poseidon2KeyedBridge.DomainSeparatedSponge`, its floor IS `DomainSeparatedCREff`, and the §5 poles
are the Regrounded file's `effFloor_top_false_babyBear` / `effFloor_bot_vacuous`, re-exported under
this module's names. So every faithfulness lemma the bridge proves
(`deployed_hash_is_family_instance`, `wins_iff_deployed_collision`) applies verbatim to the games
below, and there is exactly ONE deployed-sponge carrier in the tree for consumers to speak.

## What this does NOT buy (stated at current resolution)

The floor is FALSE at `Eff := ⊤` and vacuous at `Eff := ⊥`; both are proved in the Regrounded file and
re-exported below. What the reduction buys is that the residual is ONE named parameter with both poles
proved and its `IsPolyTime` instantiation's efficiency obligation DISCHARGED — in place of a hypothesis
the deployed hash REFUTES. It does not make the deployed BabyBear sponge collision-resistant; nothing
can.

## Axiom hygiene

`#assert_all_clean` ⊆ {propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}. No `sorry`, no fresh `axiom`, no
`native_decide`, no `decide` on an opaque prop. Cost stays SYNTACTIC (`poly_time` only ever applies
`isPolyTime_postMap`, whose cost is derived from the reduction program's syntax).

/-! ## §0 — THE DEPLOYED SPONGE, AND THE NAMED FLOOR THIS MODULE REDUCES TO.

The deployed Poseidon2 is a FIXED, UNKEYED `List ℤ → ℤ`. Its effective KEY is the domain-separation
tag — the per-use prefix the deployment absorbs ahead of the message — which is the standard
keyed-from-unkeyed model. `Poseidon2KeyedBridge.DomainSeparatedSponge` bundles exactly that, and
`poseidon2KeyedFamily` lifts it to a `HashFloorHonesty.KeyedHashFamily`, so the floor below is
`DomainSeparatedCREff D Eff = FloorGames.HashCRHardQuant (poseidon2KeyedFamily D) Eff` at the family
whose instance AT THE DEPLOYED TAG **is** the function the prover computes
(`Poseidon2KeyedBridge.deployed_hash_is_family_instance` — a definitional equality, no idealization).

⚑ This module deliberately routes through the SINGLE owner of that carrier —
`Poseidon2KeyedBridge` (the bundle + family) and `DomainSeparatedCREffRegrounded` (the `Eff`-carrying
floor with both poles priced) — instead of declaring a mirror. There is nothing to keep in sync. -/

/-! ## §1 — THE FORGERY, AS A GAME.

The deployed shape at every site: an object `a : A` is absorbed as the field-element list `code a` and
published as `sponge (tagCode t ++ code a)`. A BINDING FORGERY is therefore exactly: two objects with
DIFFERENT absorbed codes carrying the SAME published digest. That is the win relation below — not a
docstring about it, and not the existence of a collision somewhere. -/

/-- **THE GENERIC SPONGE-DIGEST FORGERY GAME.** The adversary is handed a uniformly sampled
domain-separation tag and WINS iff it outputs two objects of the site's domain `A` whose absorbed
CODES DIFFER yet whose domain-separated sponge digests AGREE — i.e. it breaks the binding of the
deployed digest `a ↦ D.hashAt t (code a)`.

The break is IN the win relation. `code` is the only per-site datum: it is how the deployed circuit
absorbs the object, so a win here is a forgery of the deployed publication, not of an abstraction. -/
def codeForgeGame (D : DomainSeparatedSponge) (A : Type) (code : A → List ℤ) : Game where

  winsDec := fun _ _ _ => inferInstance

/-- **THE DEPLOYED SPONGE'S COLLISION GAME, in the `codeForgeGame` presentation** (`code := id`). A win
here IS a collision of the deployed domain-separated function, by `Iff.rfl` — it is the same `Prop` as
`hashGame (poseidon2KeyedFamily D)`'s win. This is the COMMON TARGET every multi-absorb site's
chain-walk extractor lands in, so a fold site composes two `postMap` hops (fold forgery → collision
pair → the collision game) exactly as the `Market.WideCommitBoundary` spine does. -/

/-- **⚑ THE FORGERY IS THE DEPLOYED OBJECT.** Two objects whose codes differ but whose digest under
the DEPLOYED fixed function `D.deployedHash` agrees ARE a game win at the deployed tag. This is what
ties the abstract game to the very publication the circuit computes: the game is not free-floating. -/

  ⟨hne, heq⟩

/-! ## §2 — THE EXTRACTOR, AS A MAP OF ADVERSARIES, and the UNCONDITIONAL advantage inequality.

`Eff` does NOT appear in `code_adv_le`. It is a statement about EVERY adversary — which is what makes
the §3 domination step a reduction rather than a re-assertion. -/

/-- **THE EXTRACTOR.** A digest forger becomes a collision finder of the DEPLOYED domain-separated
sponge by reading off the two absorbed codes. A pure output reshaping, tag passed through — which is
what makes §4's efficiency preservation a theorem rather than an assumption. -/

  run := fun l t => (code (adv.run l t).1, code (adv.run l t).2)

/-- **⚑ WIN-PRESERVATION — the reduction, at the game level.** Every tag on which the forger wins, the
extracted finder wins the DEPLOYED sponge's collision game: distinct codes, equal
`sponge (tagCode t ++ ·)`. Definitional, because `poseidon2KeyedFamily`'s instance at `t` IS
`D.hashAt t`. -/

    (hashGame (poseidon2KeyedFamily D)).wins l t ((codeForgeToFinder D A code adv).run l t) :=
  hwin

/-- **THE ADVANTAGE INEQUALITY — UNCONDITIONAL, over ALL adversaries.** The forger's advantage is at
most the extracted collision finder's, at every parameter, over the SAME sampled tag space. No class
appears; this is the load-bearing content of the reduction. -/

/-! ## §3 — THE REDUCED BINDING, at an arbitrary adversary class. -/

/-- **⚑ THE REDUCED DIGEST BINDING — from the DEPLOYED sponge's collision floor, VIA the reduction.**

Under `DomainSeparatedCREff D Eff` (the deployed domain-separated sponge's collision floor at the class
`Eff`), a digest forger whose EXTRACTED finder is in that class has NEGLIGIBLE advantage: the published
digest binds the absorbed code except with negligible probability.

This is what replaces `(hCR : Poseidon2SpongeCR sponge) → a = b` as the exported headline. That form
was VACUOUS at deployed parameters; this one is not, and its residual is the single named `Eff` whose
two poles are proved in §5.

⚑ `hEff` is a PARAMETER here — the honest name for "the reduction is efficient" at an ARBITRARY class.
§4 DISCHARGES it at `Eff := IsPolyTime`. -/
theorem codeForge_advantage_bound (D : DomainSeparatedSponge) (A : Type) (code : A → List ℤ)
    (Eff : Adversary (hashGame (poseidon2KeyedFamily D)) → Prop)
    (adv : Adversary (codeForgeGame D A code))

  negl_of_le (fun l => (gameAdv_mem_unit (codeForgeGame D A code) adv l).1)
    (code_adv_le D A code adv) (hCR _ hEff)

/-! ## §4 — `hEff` DISCHARGED at `Eff := IsPolyTime`, with the overhead DERIVED.

The reduction is `Adversary.postMap` of a pure reshaping, so `CostAdversary.isPolyTime_postMap` proves
it preserves `IsPolyTime`: an EFFICIENT forger yields an EFFICIENT collision finder. The reshaper's
declared work `cw · (input size) + bw` is the honest modelling input (a Lean `fun` has no runtime, and
`CostAdversary` charges work in the PROGRAM'S SYNTAX, never as an assertable field). Everything else —
including the poly-ness of the composed overhead — is derived. -/

/-- **THE FORGERY GAME'S ANSWER ENCODING.** A forged pair costs, to write down, the two absorbed codes.
Concrete on purpose: the size measure belongs to the GAME, and leaving it open would let a degenerate
`sz := 0` make output free again. -/
def codeAnsSize (D : DomainSeparatedSponge) (A : Type) (code : A → List ℤ) :
    AnsSize (codeForgeGame D A code) :=

/-- **THE EXTRACTOR DOES NOT BLOW UP ITS INPUT** — it emits exactly the two codes it was handed, so its
output size under the collision game's encoding EQUALS its input size under the forgery game's. The
`hout` obligation of `isPolyTime_postMap`, discharged by `rfl`-shaped arithmetic rather than assumed. -/

/-! ## §5 — the `Eff` residual, PRICED AT BOTH POLES, plus the canary and the positive pole.

The poles are PROVED ONCE, at the floor's single owner (`DomainSeparatedCREffRegrounded` §4); the two
theorems below are that file's teeth re-exported under this module's names, kept so every consumer of
the reduction sees the price beside the bound. -/

/-- **⚑ THE ⊤ POLE — the floor is FALSE at the REAL BabyBear parameters** (the honest price of `hEff`).
A sponge whose output is a BabyBear field element has finite range while `List ℤ` is infinite, so a
collision exists at every tag and the floor at `Eff := ⊤` is FALSE. What the reduction buys is NOT a
floor the deployed sponge satisfies at ⊤ — no such floor exists — it is that the residual is ONE named
parameter with both poles proved, in place of a hypothesis the deployed hash outright REFUTES.

/-- **(TOOTH — the class the floor is instantiated at is NOT EMPTY.)** `IsPolyTime (hashAnsSize D)` is
not the vacuous `Eff := ⊥`: the constant finder is in it, because the answer it writes has size `0`
under the game's own encoding. Together with `CostAdversary.bruteForce_not_polyTime` (the ⊤-collapse
witness is excluded) this pins the instantiated floor strictly between the two poles. -/

/-- **(CANARY — the bound does NOT follow from the floor applied at ANOTHER finder.)** Strip the
reduction: try to conclude the forger's negligibility from the collision floor applied at some OTHER
finder `B`, not the one EXTRACTED from the forger. It does not go through — only `code_adv_le`
connects the extracted finder to the forgery game. This tooth reds if a future edit disconnects them. -/

/-! ## §6 — the INJECTIVE-CODE bridge: an OBJECT equivocation IS a game win.

Most deployed sites publish `sponge (code a)` for a code that is STRUCTURALLY injective (a canonical
serialization). For those the site's forgery — two DISTINCT OBJECTS with one digest — is a game win
directly. `hcode` is a STRUCTURAL fact about the serializer, never a crypto floor: it is exactly the
`serializeFin_injective` / `List.map_injective_iff` / cons-injectivity content the old proofs already
carried BESIDE the refuted `hCR`, and unlike `hCR` it is TRUE at deployed parameters. -/

/-- **⚑ THE OBJECT-LEVEL FORGERY IS A GAME WIN.** Under a structurally injective absorption code, two
DISTINCT objects publishing the SAME deployed digest are a `codeForgeGame` win at the deployed tag. So
"the digest binds the object" and "the digest binds the code" are the same forgery, and §3/§4's bounds
apply to the site's own equivocation. -/

/-- **THE EXACT-PROP SKELETON (the reduction's INTERNAL witness, NOT the headline).** Two objects with
equal deployed digests are EQUAL — or exhibit a genuine collision of the deployed domain-separated
sponge. This is the honest deterministic residue of the old `(hCR : Poseidon2SpongeCR sponge) → a = b`:
the refuted injectivity hypothesis is GONE, and the collision branch is what §3/§4 price. It is
retained ONLY as the extractor; it is NOT the exported binding, because a collision EXISTS at deployed
parameters, so its right branch is unconditionally available. -/

/-! ## §8 — ⚑⚑ THE DISCHARGED SUCCESSOR: the code-forgery binding on the PROVED keyed-ROM floor.

⚑ **THE MODELLING STEP, STATED (not smuggled).** The deployed domain-separated Poseidon2 is idealised
as ONE SAMPLED keyed oracle `H : Tag × Msg → Fin (2 ^ l)` — the standard ROM idealisation at an
ASYMPTOTIC digest width (`RomCarrierSites`' header names exactly what it buys and does not buy: the
floor becomes the PROVED `keyedRom_hard` birthday bound; nothing is claimed about the fixed public
function). The message domain is the TRUNCATED deployed shape: length-tagged vectors of at most `m`
BabyBear-RANGE limbs (`RomCarrierSites.BVec`). On everything the deployed prover actually absorbs —
in-range felts, bounded length — the truncation is LOSSLESS (`intListBVec_inj`), so a distinct pair of
deployed codes stays a distinct pair of ROM messages. The per-site data is UNCHANGED from §1: the
absorption code and its structural injectivity, plus the two deployed-shape facts (bounded length,
in-range limbs) the fixed layout genuinely satisfies. -/
