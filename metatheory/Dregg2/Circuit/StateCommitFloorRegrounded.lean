# `Dregg2.Circuit.StateCommitFloorRegrounded` — the `StateCommit` leaf/log injective floors proved
FALSE at deployed parameters, and their consumers RE-GROUNDED onto a REAL collision-game reduction
carrying an explicit `Eff`.

## The bug this closes (`VACUITY-SWEEP.md` FINDING 2, cluster 2)

`HashFloorHonesty` (2026-07) proved FOUR injectivity floors FALSE for any range-bounded hash and
doc-marked them BROKEN. **It did not sweep the class.** `VACUITY-SWEEP.md` FINDING 2 found ~20 more
carriers with the identical predicate shape, still doc-marked "REALIZABLE", none pointing at the teeth,
**none re-grounded**. Two of them live in `StateCommit.lean` itself — *the same file as two already-flagged
siblings*:

  * `StateCommit.cellLeafInjective CH := ∀ c v w, CH c v = CH c w → v = w`   (`StateCommit.lean:230`)
  * `StateCommit.logHashInjective LH := ∀ xs ys, LH xs = LH ys → xs = ys`    (`StateCommit.lean:238`)

Both are **FALSE at deployed parameters** and §1 proves it: `Value` is infinite (`Value.int` injects `ℤ`),
`List Turn` is infinite, and a real leaf/log hash lands in a BOUNDED BabyBear field — so pigeonhole forces
collisions and the injective floor is unsatisfiable (`cellLeafInjective_false_babyBear`,
`logHashInjective_false_babyBear`). Their consumers — `MovedDigestBindsCells`, `FrameDigestBindsCells`,
`cellDigest_binds_cells`, `recStateCommit_binds_kernel`, `transfer_circuit_full_sound`, and the
`EffectInstances2` / `EffectRefinement` log-growing effects — are therefore **VACUOUSLY TRUE at real
parameters**. `#assert_axioms` is blind to it: the proofs are clean; the *hypothesis* is the flaw.

## ⚑ The `*Realization` bundles are NON-INHABITABLE, which is worse than a hypothesis

`Poseidon2Binding.LeafRealization CH` / `LogRealization LH` carry `spongeCR : Poseidon2SpongeCR sponge`
as a **structure FIELD**, and `HashFloorHonesty.poseidon2SpongeCR_false_babyBear` had **already proved
that field's type FALSE** at BabyBear. So §1's `leafRealization_uninhabitable_babyBear` /
`logRealization_uninhabitable_babyBear` prove a deployed `LeafRealization`/`LogRealization` **value cannot
exist** — this is the `Compress8CR`-in-`Cap8Scheme` shape the sweep flagged as the priority. Every
discharge routed through them (`cellLeafInjective_of_realization`, `logHashInjective_of_realization`, and
`Verify/KeystoneAuditArgusReceipt.LH₀_inj`) is satisfied only by the TOY injective sponge
(`Reference.refLogRealization`, `Encodable.encode`) — verbatim the **FALSE COMFORT**
`HashFloorHonesty`'s own header named: *"toy witness satisfiable; real instantiation false."*

## ⚑ The re-grounding does NOT go through the `⊤`-class floor — that floor is false too

`FloorGames.hashCRHardQuant_top_false_of_compressing` proves `HashCRHardQuant F (fun _ => True)` is
ITSELF FALSE at deployed parameters (the `Classical.choice` finder wins with probability `1` on a
compressing family). That floor used to be spelled `HashFloorHonesty.CollisionResistant F`, which hid
the `⊤` the reader has to see to price the assumption; the `def` is DELETED (2026-07-28) and the tooth
is carried through under the name above, with the `⊤` written out. At the **unrestricted** adversary
class every floor is false-at-deployed or vacuous — `hard_top_iff_solvableFrac_negl` is an `↔`, so no
restatement of the win relation escapes. **The only honest escape is the `Eff` parameter**
(`FloorGames` §8), and this file takes it, exactly as `HermineHashCRRegrounded` does.

So the re-grounded consumers below condition on `HashCRHardQuant F Eff` — the collision floor at a
NAMED, EXPLICIT adversary class — and carry the `Eff`-membership obligation for the finder the reduction
builds, in the open, at the use site.

## The re-grounding, per consumer (§3–§5)

The deployed consumer is `StateCommit.cellDigest_binds_cells` / `recStateCommit_binds_kernel`: "equal
cell-digests force equal cell maps". Its BREAK is a **state-commitment equivocator** — two kernels with
the SAME accounts, both `AccountsWF`, whose cell maps DIFFER yet whose `cellDigest`s agree. §3 makes that
a first-class `Game` (`scEquivGame`) read directly off the deployed `cellDigest`; nothing here is a
docstring.

§4 is the reduction, as four maps of adversaries into three collision games over the SAME sampled
instance space:

  * **`scToOuterNodeAdv`** — the equivocator's two `(frameDigest, movedDigest)` children: a collision of
    the 2-to-1 node hash at the cell-digest root.
  * **`scToMovedNodeAdv`** — its two `(CH src, CH dst)` children: a node collision inside `movedDigest`.
  * **`scToSpongeAdv`** — its two sorted leaf lists: a collision of the frame sponge.
  * **`scToLeafAdv`** — the two `Value`s at the cell where the maps differ (`diffCell`): a collision of
    the LEAF hash — the horn `cellLeafInjective` was carrying for free.

`sc_wins_imp` is the dichotomy: every instance the equivocator wins, one of the four derived finders wins
a genuine collision game — proved by the exhaustive `{src} ∪ {dst} ∪ (accounts \ {src,dst}) ∪ dead`
partition, with the dead-cell case closed by `AccountsWF` on both states (the SAME partition
`cellDigest_binds_cells` runs, contraposed into an extractor). `sc_adv_le` is the union bound over the
shared instance space; `stateCommit_equivocation_advantage_bound` is the keystone: under the collision
floor at the three families the reduction attacks, an equivocator has NEGLIGIBLE advantage.

**This statement is FALSE if you delete the reduction** — the conclusion is about the equivocation game,
the hypotheses about the collision games, and `sc_adv_le` is the only bridge. §6's canary compiles that
fact; it was unwritable under the free `cellLeafInjective` hypothesis.

## Non-fake

The floors are SATISFIABLE (`hard_bot_vacuous`, recorded honestly and worth nothing on its own — the
value of a satisfiability witness is nothing without the refutation beside it) and the derived collision
floors are priced exactly by §7: `Eff := ⊤` makes them FALSE at compressing parameters,
`Eff := ⊥` vacuous. `valueDecEq` is COMPUTABLE, derived from the proven-injective `Poseidon2Binding.Reference.encV`
— no `Classical.decEq` smuggled into the counting. Old injective-floor consumers KEPT untouched; siblings
ADDED. `#assert_all_clean`; no `sorry`, no fresh `axiom`.

## Coordination

This is the COMMIT-STATE lane of the FINDING-2 sweep (`cellLeafInjective`/`logHashInjective`). The factory
content-hash, the 2-to-1 `Compress1CR` and the macaroon binding hash are
`Crypto.FactoryBindingFloorRegrounded` (sibling file, same cluster); `compress4Injective` /
`Poseidon2WideCR` / `Compress8CR` are other lanes'. The commit-reveal side is
`Crypto.HermineHashCRRegrounded`, whose `winProb_le_add_of_imp` union bound this file REUSES rather than
duplicates.

/-! ## §1 — FALSIFIABILITY TEETH: the two `StateCommit` floors are FALSE at deployed parameters.

The counting core is `HashFloorHonesty.not_injective_of_finite_range` — an injective function from an
INFINITE domain has an INFINITE range, and a real hash's range is a bounded field. Nobody had tried to
prove THESE two false, which is why the sweep found them still doc-marked "REALIZABLE". -/

/-- A function into a bounded integer window has finite range (`⊆ Ico 0 q`). The general form of
`HashFloorHonesty.finite_range_of_field_bound`, which is specialized to `List ℤ → ℤ`; both leaf

/-- `Value` is INFINITE — `Value.int` injects all of `ℤ`. This is what makes the leaf floor false: a
cell's `Value` is unbounded data, and a leaf hash pins it into ONE field element. -/
instance : Infinite Value :=
  Infinite.of_injective Value.int (fun _ _ h => by injection h)

/-- `List Turn` is INFINITE (the length-`n` constant lists are distinct). This is what makes the log
floor false: the receipt chain GROWS without bound, and the log hash pins it into ONE field element. -/

  Infinite.of_injective (fun n : ℕ => List.replicate n (⟨0, 0, 0, 0⟩ : Turn))

/-- **TOOTH 1 — `cellLeafInjective` is FALSE for a range-bounded leaf hash.** At any FIXED cell `c`, the
leaf map `CH c : Value → ℤ` runs the infinite `Value` into a finite set of field elements, so pigeonhole

Poseidon2 leaf hash the deployed `recStateCommit` runs — refutes the floor. The floor is not merely
un-proven for the real hash; it is provably FALSE there, exactly as

/-! ### ⚑ The `*Realization` bundles are NON-INHABITABLE at deployed parameters.

Worse than a false hypothesis on a theorem: `Poseidon2Binding.LeafRealization` / `LogRealization` carry
`spongeCR : Poseidon2SpongeCR sponge` as a structure FIELD, whose type `HashFloorHonesty` had ALREADY
proved false at BabyBear. So a deployed realization VALUE cannot exist, and every discharge routed
through one is satisfied only by the toy injective `Encodable.encode` sponge. This is the
`Compress8CR`-in-`Cap8Scheme` shape the sweep named the priority — here, twice, in the leaf/log tree. -/

/-- **(TOOTH — a deployed `LeafRealization` CANNOT EXIST.)** If the sponge a `LeafRealization` factors
through is BabyBear-range-bounded — which every real Poseidon2 `hash_many` is — the bundle is
uninhabitable: its `spongeCR` field's type is FALSE. So
`Poseidon2Binding.cellLeafInjective_of_realization` discharges `cellLeafInjective` only at a sponge no
deployment runs. -/

/-- **(TOOTH — a deployed `LogRealization` CANNOT EXIST.)** Same for the log side. In particular
`Verify/KeystoneAuditArgusReceipt.LH₀_inj` — which discharges `logHashInjective` via
`logHashInjective_of_realization refLogRealization` — stands on `Reference.refLogRealization`, whose
sponge IS `Encodable.encode` (injective into ALL of `ℤ`, range NOT bounded). The receipt's carrier is
discharged, and at BabyBear it could not be. -/

/-! ## §2 — the honest floor's carriers: decidable equality, and the union bound.

`KeyedHashFamily` needs `DecidableEq` on its input (the game checks `x ≠ x'`). The tree deliberately has
NO `DecidableEq Value` (`FinKernelStep`, `EffectsAsDataProto`, `FlowRefine` each note the absence). We do
NOT reach for `Classical.decEq`: `Poseidon2Binding.Reference.encV_inj` already proves `encV : Value → ℕ` injective,
so decidable equality on `Value` is COMPUTABLE, and the collision game's counting stays a real finite
count. Kept a plain `def` (NOT an instance) so the tree's deliberate absence is not disturbed. -/

/-- **Decidable equality on `Value`, COMPUTED** — via the proven-injective `Poseidon2Binding.Reference.encV`. Not
an instance (the tree deliberately has none); supplied explicitly to the leaf family below. -/

/-- **THE THREE-HORN UNION BOUND.** `HermineHashCRRegrounded.winProb_le_add_of_imp` peeled once: if every
winning outcome of `f` wins one of `g`, `h`, `k`, then `winProb f ≤ winProb g + (winProb h + winProb k)`.

/-! ## §3 — the state-commitment equivocator, as a first-class λ-indexed game.

The deployed consumer is `StateCommit.cellDigest_binds_cells`: equal `cellDigest`s force equal cell maps,
GIVEN `compressInjective compress`, `compressNInjective compressN` and `cellLeafInjective CH` — all three
false at deployed parameters (§1 and `HashFloorHonesty`). Its BREAK is an equivocator: two kernels over
the same accounts, both `AccountsWF`, with DIFFERENT cell maps and EQUAL cell-digests. This section makes
that adversary a `Game` played over a SAMPLED instance, exactly as `HermineHashCRRegrounded`'s
`concurrentForgeryGame` makes a rushing forger one. -/

/-- **THE STATE-COMMITMENT FAMILY.** At each security parameter `l`: a FINITE space of sampled instances,
and per instance the deployed commitment surface — the leaf hash `CH`, the 2-to-1 node hash `compress`,
the frame sponge `compressN`, and the `turn` the commitment is taken at. This carries the deployed data of
`StateCommit.cellDigest` and nothing else. (The instance is the honest home of the domain-separation the
deployed unkeyed Poseidon2 uses as its effective key — `HashFloorHonesty` §2.) -/

  turn : ∀ l, Inst l → Turn

/-- **THE LEAF-HASH KEYED FAMILY.** Inputs are `(cell, value)` pairs, outputs field elements, and the
keyed hash is the deployed `CH`. A `cellLeafInjective` break at cell `c` — two distinct `Value`s with
equal leaves — IS a collision of this family (the pair `((c,v),(c,w))`). Keys are the SAME sampled

`StateCommit.cellDigest_binds_cells` walks the exhaustive partition `{src} ∪ {dst} ∪ (accounts\{src,dst})
∪ dead` and uses the three injectivity floors to force equality at each. CONTRAPOSED, that walk is an
EXTRACTOR: wherever the cell maps differ, the equal digests hand back a collision at one of three real
hash sites. These are the maps. -/

/-- A cell where two cell maps DIFFER. `Classical.epsilon` on the `∃` that `funext` contraposes to — the
adversary must be TOTAL, so on agreeing maps this is junk, which is real and harmless (the reduction only
ever reads it under a winning `p.1.cell ≠ p.2.cell`). -/

/-- **HORN 4 — the LEAF collision, as a map of adversaries — the horn `cellLeafInjective` was carrying
for free.** At the cell where the two maps differ, the two `Value`s. When the node/sponge horns close,
these two DISTINCT values have EQUAL leaves: precisely a `cellLeafInjective` counterexample, now a
collision the floor must pay for. -/

/-! ## §5 — the RE-GROUNDED keystone. -/

/-- **⚑ RE-GROUNDED `StateCommit.cellDigest_binds_cells` / `recStateCommit_binds_kernel` — from
COLLISION HARDNESS at the three families the reduction attacks, VIA the reduction.**

Under the collision floor at the node hash, the frame sponge and the LEAF hash — each at a NAMED adversary
class `Eff` — a state-commitment equivocator whose four extracted finders lie in those classes has
NEGLIGIBLE advantage: the published cell-digest pins the whole cell map EXCEPT with negligible
probability. The Boolean "equal digests ⇒ equal cell maps", which needed the FALSE `cellLeafInjective`
(§1) and its two already-flagged siblings, becomes an honest advantage bound.

⚑ **THE `hEff*` OBLIGATIONS ARE UNDISCHARGED AND THAT IS THE HONEST STATE.** They say the extracted
finders are in the classes the floors quantify over — the standard "the reduction is efficient". They are
PARAMETERS here, in the open, at the use site, because this tree has no cost model (`FloorGames` §8). The
floors are priced exactly by §7: `Eff := ⊤` makes them FALSE at compressing parameters (which is why this
file does NOT route through `HashCRHardQuant _ (fun _ => True)` — refuted by
`FloorGames.hashCRHardQuant_top_false_of_compressing`, and the floor the DELETED
`HashFloorHonesty.CollisionResistant` was a name for), `Eff := ⊥` vacuous. -/

/-! ## §5b — the LOG-HASH consumer, re-grounded (`logHashInjective`).

⚑ **The honest scope of this one is smaller than §3–§5, and saying so is the point.** The leaf floor
needed a four-horn reduction because `cellDigest` is a TREE: an equivocation there could be paid for at any
of four hash sites, and only the walk of the partition says which. The log floor is not a tree.
`logHashInjective LH := ∀ xs ys, LH xs = LH ys → xs = ys` is consumed by `EffectInstances2` /
`EffectRefinement` (`effect2_circuit_full_sound`, `effect_refines_*`) for exactly one thing: recovering the
receipt chain from its digest. Its BREAK — two distinct turn lists with one log hash — **IS definitionally
a collision of the log hash**, so there is no multi-horn dichotomy to build and inventing one would be
theatre.

What the re-grounding buys here is therefore precise and it is not nothing: the consumer moves off a
hypothesis that is FALSE at deployed parameters (`logHashInjective_false_babyBear`, and
`logRealization_uninhabitable_babyBear` for the bundle that discharges it) onto a floor about an
adversary FINDING a collision, at a NAMED `Eff` class. Existence → advantage. That is the entire content.

⚑ **A `scLogFamily_CR_of_logHashInjective` bridge used to stand below, and it is DELETED (2026-07-28).**
It read `logHashInjective` at every instance ⟹ the log family's floor at the UNRESTRICTED class, and the
finding it was half of was stated as "the old carrier was STRICTLY STRONGER than needed AND
unsatisfiable". The first half does not survive contact with its own target: that target is
`HashCRHardQuant (scLogFamily F) (fun _ => True)`, which `sc_log_floor_top_false_of_compressing` — right
below, in this same file — proves FALSE for a compressing log hash, and §1's counting core forces the
collision it asks for at exactly the BabyBear parameters that refute the source. Both ends refuted; the
implication is true and empty. What carries the finding now is
`logHashInjective_false_babyBear` alone (the old carrier is unsatisfiable, so its consumers were
vacuous), with the honest floor stated at a named `Eff` here and PROVED at §10's keyed-ROM successor
`log_equivocation_rom`. -/

/-! ## §6 — the CANARY: break the reduction and the keystone goes RED.

The sweep's lesson is that a floor consumer must be checked by asking whether it survives the WRONG
hypothesis. Under the OLD statement — `cellDigest_binds_cells (hLeaf : cellLeafInjective CH) …` — the
hypothesis was a FREE `Prop` that the conclusion never mentions, so no such canary was writable: the
floor and the conclusion did not share an object to disconnect. Here they cannot avoid it. -/

/-- **(CANARY — the keystone does NOT follow from the floors applied at OTHER adversaries.)** Strip the
reduction — try to conclude the equivocator's negligibility from the collision floors applied at some
OTHER finders `B`, `C`, `D`, `E`, NOT the ones extracted from it — and the proof does not go through: the
floors bound `B`/`C`/`D`/`E`, and only `sc_adv_le` connects the EXTRACTED four to the equivocation game.
The `negl_add` chain proves `Negl` of the WRONG advantage sum, so it cannot close
`Negl (gameAdv (scEquivGame F) A)`. This tooth was impossible to write under the old free
`cellLeafInjective` hypothesis; it compiles now, and REDS if a future edit reconnects the games. -/

/-! ## §8 — ⚑ the OLD floor is WEAKER than its family, and the reduction stays on the DIAGONAL.

The usual re-grounding note is "the old injective floor implies the new one, so it was strictly stronger
and, being false, empty" (`Crypto.HermineHashCRRegrounded.commitRevealFamily_CR_of_hashcr` for the
flagged siblings — and §5b records why that note buys less than it reads: the floor such a bridge lands
on is the `⊤`-class one, refuted at a real hash by §7's teeth).
**Here it is FALSE outright, and saying so is the point.** `cellLeafInjective CH` is injectivity in the
`Value` at a FIXED cell — it says NOTHING about `CH c v = CH c' w` for `c ≠ c'`. So it does NOT discharge
`HashCRHardQuant (scLeafFamily F) (fun _ => True)`, whose game admits cross-cell collisions: the old
carrier is not merely false, it is not even the right shape for its own family.

What saves the reduction is that it never needs the cross-cell case: `scToLeafAdv` outputs a DIAGONAL
pair by construction (`scToLeafAdv_diagonal`), because the cell where two maps differ is ONE cell. So the
leaf floor is consumed exactly on the diagonal — precisely the property `cellLeafInjective` was claiming
for free, now paid for as a collision advantage. The `EffLeaf` class the keystone quantifies over may
therefore be taken to contain only diagonal finders without weakening the bound. -/

/-- **The extracted leaf finder is DIAGONAL** — it always outputs two `(cell, value)` pairs at the SAME
cell. So `stateCommit_equivocation_advantage_bound` consumes the leaf collision floor only on the
diagonal, which is exactly the surface `cellLeafInjective` claimed to cover — no cross-cell strength is
smuggled in, and the floor may be restricted to diagonal finders without weakening the keystone. -/

/-! ## §9 — the answer-size cost model (the honest record), and ⚑ the DELETED `IsPolyTime` discharges.

`stateCommit_equivocation_from_polyTime` and `log_equivocation_from_polyTime` stood here: all four
`hEff*` legs (resp. the log leg) DERIVED at `Eff := IsPolyTime` by `poly_time`. Their floors
`HashCRHardQuant … (IsPolyTime …)` are REFUTED at deployed parameters
(`Exec.SystemRootsBindingReduction.sysRoots_floor_polyTime_false_babyBear`: `IsPolyTime` prices answer
SIZE, so a `.pure` answerer with a hardcoded short collision is in the class and wins with probability
`1`) — the derivations derived nothing real. BOTH ARE DELETED; §10 lands the successors on the PROVED
keyed-ROM floor. The answer-size encodings and `scFrameList_length_le` below are KEPT as the honest
record of what that cost model can price (and the frame horn's linear-output fact is real).

§5's keystone carried FOUR bare `hEff*` parameters, one per extracted finder — the honest name for "the
reduction is efficient", undischarged because `FloorGames` §8 had no cost model.
`Dregg2.Crypto.CostAdversary` supplies one at COST-VECTOR resolution (intrinsic instructions +
per-oracle call counts, DERIVED from a deep-embedded program's syntax), and every one of the four horns
is a pure output reshaping of the equivocator's answer with the sampled instance passed through — i.e.
an `Adversary.postMap` — so `isPolyTime_postMap` turns all four parameters into CONSEQUENCES of ONE
hypothesis: that the equivocator itself is efficient.

The only per-site inputs left are the reshapers' DECLARED work `(cw, bw)` (a Lean `fun` has no runtime;
that number is CHARGED in the program's syntax) and each horn's OUTPUT SIZE, PROVED here:

  * the two NODE horns and the LEAF horn write a FIXED-WIDTH answer (two `ℤ×ℤ` pairs / two
    `(cell, value)` pairs), so their growth constants are `(0, 4)`;
  * the SPONGE horn writes the two frame lists, whose length is the untouched carrier's cardinality —
    bounded by the kernel's own `accounts` (`scFrameList_length_le`, `scCarrier` is a SUBSET), so its
    growth constants are `(1, 0)` against the game's own answer measure. Nothing here is asserted: the
    frame horn is the one horn that could have blown up, and it provably does not. -/

/-- **THE EQUIVOCATION GAME'S ANSWER ENCODING.** A forged pair of kernels costs, to write down, its two
account sets. Concrete on purpose: the size measure belongs to the GAME (`CostAdversary` design
commitment 4), and leaving it open would let a degenerate `sz := 0` make the frame horn's output free. -/

UNTOUCHED cell, and the untouched carrier is `accounts \ {src, dst}` — a SUBSET of the kernel's own

/-! ## §10 — ⚑⚑ THE DISCHARGED SUCCESSORS: the state-commit equivocation and the log binding on the
PROVED keyed-ROM floor.

⚑ **THE MODELLING STEP, STATED (not smuggled).** The three deployed hash surfaces — the leaf hash
`CH`, the 2-to-1 node hash `compress`, the frame sponge `compressN` — are idealised as ONE SAMPLED
oracle `H` over a THREE-shape, constructor-separated message domain (`ScRomMsg`): leaf messages are
truncated `(cell, encV value)` pairs, node messages are pairs of `λ`-bit digests (the chained
re-absorption, carried in the type exactly as `Exec.SystemRootsBindingReduction`'s `SysRomMsg`), and
sponge messages are length-tagged vectors of at most `m` digests. `scRomFamily` is that surface AS a
`StateCommitFamily` INSTANCE — so §3–§5's game, extractors, dichotomy and union bound apply VERBATIM;
nothing about the reduction is re-authored, only WHO evaluates the absorbed messages changes. The
floors §5's keystone consumes are then PROVED (`scNodeRom_hard` / `scSpongeRom_hard` /
`scLeafRom_hard`, each `KeyedRomFloor.keyedRom_hard` through a query-preserving `mapOut` extraction),
where the deleted `IsPolyTime` instantiation consumed floors that are REFUTED.

⚑ **WHAT STAYS OPEN, NAMED.** The keystone `stateCommit_equivocation_rom` carries its four
extracted-finder class memberships (`hOuter`/`hMoved`/`hSponge`/`hLeaf`) as HYPOTHESES — the honest
`hEff` shape of §5, now at classes whose floors are PROVED. Deriving them from the equivocator's own
query budget needs the CHAINED walk (the extracted digests are ORACLE outputs, so the extractor must
re-query — `RomCarrierSites.OracleComp.bindComp` is the tool and the kernel's account count prices the
walk); that derivation is the named residual. It is NOT vacuous conditioning:
`stateCommit_equivocation_rom_fires` exhibits a REAL equivocator (with hand-built query trees for all
four extracted finders) satisfying every hypothesis, end-to-end to a genuine `Negl`. The truncation
windows (`InD`, `babyBearP`) are win-conditional side conditions in the classes — the deployed felt
shapes satisfy them by layout, the felt-width wound carried visibly
(`docs/WOUND-felt-width-boundaries-2026-07-19.md`). -/
