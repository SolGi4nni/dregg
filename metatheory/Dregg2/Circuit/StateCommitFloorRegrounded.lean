# `Dregg2.Circuit.StateCommitFloorRegrounded` — the `StateCommit` leaf/log injective floors proved
FALSE at deployed parameters, and their consumers RE-GROUNDED onto a REAL collision-game reduction
carrying an explicit `Eff`.

## The bug this closes (`VACUITY-SWEEP.md` FINDING 2, cluster 2)

`HashFloorHonesty` (2026-07) proved FOUR injectivity floors FALSE for any range-bounded hash and
doc-marked them BROKEN. **It did not sweep the class.** `VACUITY-SWEEP.md` FINDING 2 found ~20 more
carriers with the identical predicate shape, still doc-marked "REALIZABLE", none pointing at the teeth,
**none re-grounded**. Two of them live in `StateCommit.lean` itself — *the same file as two already-flagged
siblings*:

  * `StateCommit.cellLeafInjective CH := ∀ c v w, CH c v = CH c w → v = w`   (`StateCommit.lean:230`)
  * `StateCommit.logHashInjective LH := ∀ xs ys, LH xs = LH ys → xs = ys`    (`StateCommit.lean:238`)

Both are **FALSE at deployed parameters** and §1 proves it: `Value` is infinite (`Value.int` injects `ℤ`),
`List Turn` is infinite, and a real leaf/log hash lands in a BOUNDED BabyBear field — so pigeonhole forces
collisions and the injective floor is unsatisfiable (`cellLeafInjective_false_babyBear`,
`logHashInjective_false_babyBear`). Their consumers — `MovedDigestBindsCells`, `FrameDigestBindsCells`,
`cellDigest_binds_cells`, `recStateCommit_binds_kernel`, `transfer_circuit_full_sound`, and the
`EffectInstances2` / `EffectRefinement` log-growing effects — are therefore **VACUOUSLY TRUE at real
parameters**. `#assert_axioms` is blind to it: the proofs are clean; the *hypothesis* is the flaw.

## ⚑ The `*Realization` bundles are NON-INHABITABLE, which is worse than a hypothesis

`Poseidon2Binding.LeafRealization CH` / `LogRealization LH` carry `spongeCR : Poseidon2SpongeCR sponge`
as a **structure FIELD**, and `HashFloorHonesty.poseidon2SpongeCR_false_babyBear` had **already proved
that field's type FALSE** at BabyBear. So §1's `leafRealization_uninhabitable_babyBear` /
`logRealization_uninhabitable_babyBear` prove a deployed `LeafRealization`/`LogRealization` **value cannot
exist** — this is the `Compress8CR`-in-`Cap8Scheme` shape the sweep flagged as the priority. Every
discharge routed through them (`cellLeafInjective_of_realization`, `logHashInjective_of_realization`, and
`Verify/KeystoneAuditArgusReceipt.LH₀_inj`) is satisfied only by the TOY injective sponge
(`Reference.refLogRealization`, `Encodable.encode`) — verbatim the **FALSE COMFORT**
`HashFloorHonesty`'s own header named: *"toy witness satisfiable; real instantiation false."*

## ⚑ The re-grounding does NOT go through `CollisionResistant` — that floor is false too

`FloorGames.collisionResistant_false_of_compressing` proves `HashFloorHonesty.CollisionResistant F` is
ITSELF FALSE at deployed parameters (`CollisionResistant F ↔ HashCRHardQuant F ⊤`, and the
`Classical.choice` finder wins with probability `1` on a compressing family). At the **unrestricted**
adversary class every floor is false-at-deployed or vacuous — `hard_top_iff_solvableFrac_negl` is an `↔`,
so no restatement of the win relation escapes. **The only honest escape is the `Eff` parameter**
(`FloorGames` §8), and this file takes it, exactly as `HermineHashCRRegrounded` does.

So the re-grounded consumers below condition on `HashCRHardQuant F Eff` — the collision floor at a
NAMED, EXPLICIT adversary class — and carry the `Eff`-membership obligation for the finder the reduction
builds, in the open, at the use site.

## The re-grounding, per consumer (§3–§5)

The deployed consumer is `StateCommit.cellDigest_binds_cells` / `recStateCommit_binds_kernel`: "equal
cell-digests force equal cell maps". Its BREAK is a **state-commitment equivocator** — two kernels with
the SAME accounts, both `AccountsWF`, whose cell maps DIFFER yet whose `cellDigest`s agree. §3 makes that
a first-class `Game` (`scEquivGame`) read directly off the deployed `cellDigest`; nothing here is a
docstring.

§4 is the reduction, as four maps of adversaries into three collision games over the SAME sampled
instance space:

  * **`scToOuterNodeAdv`** — the equivocator's two `(frameDigest, movedDigest)` children: a collision of
    the 2-to-1 node hash at the cell-digest root.
  * **`scToMovedNodeAdv`** — its two `(CH src, CH dst)` children: a node collision inside `movedDigest`.
  * **`scToSpongeAdv`** — its two sorted leaf lists: a collision of the frame sponge.
  * **`scToLeafAdv`** — the two `Value`s at the cell where the maps differ (`diffCell`): a collision of
    the LEAF hash — the horn `cellLeafInjective` was carrying for free.

`sc_wins_imp` is the dichotomy: every instance the equivocator wins, one of the four derived finders wins
a genuine collision game — proved by the exhaustive `{src} ∪ {dst} ∪ (accounts \ {src,dst}) ∪ dead`
partition, with the dead-cell case closed by `AccountsWF` on both states (the SAME partition
`cellDigest_binds_cells` runs, contraposed into an extractor). `sc_adv_le` is the union bound over the
shared instance space; `stateCommit_equivocation_advantage_bound` is the keystone: under the collision
floor at the three families the reduction attacks, an equivocator has NEGLIGIBLE advantage.

**This statement is FALSE if you delete the reduction** — the conclusion is about the equivocation game,
the hypotheses about the collision games, and `sc_adv_le` is the only bridge. §6's canary compiles that
fact; it was unwritable under the free `cellLeafInjective` hypothesis.

## Non-fake

The floors are SATISFIABLE (`hard_bot_vacuous`, recorded honestly and worth nothing on its own — the
value of a satisfiability witness is nothing without the refutation beside it) and the derived collision
floors are priced exactly by §7: `Eff := ⊤` makes them FALSE at compressing parameters,
`Eff := ⊥` vacuous. `valueDecEq` is COMPUTABLE, derived from the proven-injective `Poseidon2Binding.Reference.encV`
— no `Classical.decEq` smuggled into the counting. Old injective-floor consumers KEPT untouched; siblings
ADDED. `#assert_all_clean`; no `sorry`, no fresh `axiom`.

## Coordination

This is the COMMIT-STATE lane of the FINDING-2 sweep (`cellLeafInjective`/`logHashInjective`). The factory
content-hash, the 2-to-1 `Compress1CR` and the macaroon binding hash are
`Crypto.FactoryBindingFloorRegrounded` (sibling file, same cluster); `compress4Injective` /
`Poseidon2WideCR` / `Compress8CR` are other lanes'. The commit-reveal side is
`Crypto.HermineHashCRRegrounded`, whose `winProb_le_add_of_imp` union bound this file REUSES rather than
duplicates.

The counting core is `HashFloorHonesty.not_injective_of_finite_range` — an injective function from an
INFINITE domain has an INFINITE range, and a real hash's range is a bounded field. Nobody had tried to

  Infinite.of_injective Value.int (fun _ _ h => by injection h)

/-- `List Turn` is INFINITE (the length-`n` constant lists are distinct). This is what makes the log

/-- **TOOTH 1 — `cellLeafInjective` is FALSE for a range-bounded leaf hash.** At any FIXED cell `c`, the

Poseidon2 leaf hash the deployed `recStateCommit` runs — refutes the floor. The floor is not merely
un-proven for the real hash; it is provably FALSE there, exactly as

/-! ### ⚑ The `*Realization` bundles are NON-INHABITABLE at deployed parameters.

Worse than a false hypothesis on a theorem: `Poseidon2Binding.LeafRealization` / `LogRealization` carry
`spongeCR : Poseidon2SpongeCR sponge` as a structure FIELD, whose type `HashFloorHonesty` had ALREADY
proved false at BabyBear. So a deployed realization VALUE cannot exist, and every discharge routed
through one is satisfied only by the toy injective `Encodable.encode` sponge. This is the
`Compress8CR`-in-`Cap8Scheme` shape the sweep named the priority — here, twice, in the leaf/log tree. -/

/-- **(TOOTH — a deployed `LeafRealization` CANNOT EXIST.)** If the sponge a `LeafRealization` factors
through is BabyBear-range-bounded — which every real Poseidon2 `hash_many` is — the bundle is
uninhabitable: its `spongeCR` field's type is FALSE. So
`Poseidon2Binding.cellLeafInjective_of_realization` discharges `cellLeafInjective` only at a sponge no
deployment runs. -/

`Verify/KeystoneAuditArgusReceipt.LH₀_inj` — which discharges `logHashInjective` via
`logHashInjective_of_realization refLogRealization` — stands on `Reference.refLogRealization`, whose
sponge IS `Encodable.encode` (injective into ALL of `ℤ`, range NOT bounded). The receipt's carrier is
discharged, and at BabyBear it could not be. -/

/-! ## §2 — the honest floor's carriers: decidable equality, and the union bound.

`KeyedHashFamily` needs `DecidableEq` on its input (the game checks `x ≠ x'`). The tree deliberately has
NO `DecidableEq Value` (`FinKernelStep`, `EffectsAsDataProto`, `FlowRefine` each note the absence). We do
NOT reach for `Classical.decEq`: `Poseidon2Binding.Reference.encV_inj` already proves `encV : Value → ℕ` injective,
so decidable equality on `Value` is COMPUTABLE, and the collision game's counting stays a real finite
count. Kept a plain `def` (NOT an instance) so the tree's deliberate absence is not disturbed. -/

/-- **Decidable equality on `Value`, COMPUTED** — via the proven-injective `Poseidon2Binding.Reference.encV`. Not
an instance (the tree deliberately has none); supplied explicitly to the leaf family below. -/

/-- **THE THREE-HORN UNION BOUND.** `HermineHashCRRegrounded.winProb_le_add_of_imp` peeled once: if every
winning outcome of `f` wins one of `g`, `h`, `k`, then `winProb f ≤ winProb g + (winProb h + winProb k)`.

/-! ## §3 — the state-commitment equivocator, as a first-class λ-indexed game.

The deployed consumer is `StateCommit.cellDigest_binds_cells`: equal `cellDigest`s force equal cell maps,
GIVEN `compressInjective compress`, `compressNInjective compressN` and `cellLeafInjective CH` — all three
false at deployed parameters (§1 and `HashFloorHonesty`). Its BREAK is an equivocator: two kernels over
the same accounts, both `AccountsWF`, with DIFFERENT cell maps and EQUAL cell-digests. This section makes
that adversary a `Game` played over a SAMPLED instance, exactly as `HermineHashCRRegrounded`'s
`concurrentForgeryGame` makes a rushing forger one. -/

/-- **THE STATE-COMMITMENT FAMILY.** At each security parameter `l`: a FINITE space of sampled instances,
and per instance the deployed commitment surface — the leaf hash `CH`, the 2-to-1 node hash `compress`,
the frame sponge `compressN`, and the `turn` the commitment is taken at. This carries the deployed data of
`StateCommit.cellDigest` and nothing else. (The instance is the honest home of the domain-separation the
deployed unkeyed Poseidon2 uses as its effective key — `HashFloorHonesty` §2.) -/

/-- **THE LEAF-HASH KEYED FAMILY.** Inputs are `(cell, value)` pairs, outputs field elements, and the
keyed hash is the deployed `CH`. A `cellLeafInjective` break at cell `c` — two distinct `Value`s with
equal leaves — IS a collision of this family (the pair `((c,v),(c,w))`). Keys are the SAME sampled

`StateCommit.cellDigest_binds_cells` walks the exhaustive partition `{src} ∪ {dst} ∪ (accounts\{src,dst})
∪ dead` and uses the three injectivity floors to force equality at each. CONTRAPOSED, that walk is an
EXTRACTOR: wherever the cell maps differ, the equal digests hand back a collision at one of three real
hash sites. These are the maps. -/

/-- A cell where two cell maps DIFFER. `Classical.epsilon` on the `∃` that `funext` contraposes to — the

/-- **⚑ RE-GROUNDED `StateCommit.cellDigest_binds_cells` / `recStateCommit_binds_kernel` — from
COLLISION HARDNESS at the three families the reduction attacks, VIA the reduction.**

Under the collision floor at the node hash, the frame sponge and the LEAF hash — each at a NAMED adversary
class `Eff` — a state-commitment equivocator whose four extracted finders lie in those classes has
NEGLIGIBLE advantage: the published cell-digest pins the whole cell map EXCEPT with negligible
probability. The Boolean "equal digests ⇒ equal cell maps", which needed the FALSE `cellLeafInjective`
(§1) and its two already-flagged siblings, becomes an honest advantage bound.

⚑ **THE `hEff*` OBLIGATIONS ARE UNDISCHARGED AND THAT IS THE HONEST STATE.** They say the extracted
finders are in the classes the floors quantify over — the standard "the reduction is efficient". They are
PARAMETERS here, in the open, at the use site, because this tree has no cost model (`FloorGames` §8). The
floors are priced exactly by §7: `Eff := ⊤` makes them FALSE at compressing parameters (which is why this
file does NOT route through `HashFloorHonesty.CollisionResistant`, itself
`HashCRHardQuant _ ⊤` and itself false — `FloorGames.collisionResistant_false_of_compressing`),

/-! ## §5b — the LOG-HASH consumer, re-grounded (`logHashInjective`).

⚑ **The honest scope of this one is smaller than §3–§5, and saying so is the point.** The leaf floor
needed a four-horn reduction because `cellDigest` is a TREE: an equivocation there could be paid for at any
of four hash sites, and only the walk of the partition says which. The log floor is not a tree.
`logHashInjective LH := ∀ xs ys, LH xs = LH ys → xs = ys` is consumed by `EffectInstances2` /
`EffectRefinement` (`effect2_circuit_full_sound`, `effect_refines_*`) for exactly one thing: recovering the
receipt chain from its digest. Its BREAK — two distinct turn lists with one log hash — **IS definitionally
a collision of the log hash**, so there is no multi-horn dichotomy to build and inventing one would be
theatre.

What the re-grounding buys here is therefore precise and it is not nothing: the consumer moves off a
hypothesis that is FALSE at deployed parameters (`logHashInjective_false_babyBear`, and
`logRealization_uninhabitable_babyBear` for the bundle that discharges it) onto a floor about an
adversary FINDING a collision, at a NAMED `Eff` class. Existence → advantage. That is the entire content,
and `scLogFamily_CR_of_logHashInjective` + `logHashInjective_false_babyBear` together are the finding:
the old carrier was STRICTLY STRONGER than needed AND unsatisfiable. -/

EXCEPT with negligible probability. The Boolean "equal log hashes ⇒ equal chains", which needed the FALSE
`logHashInjective`, becomes an honest advantage bound.

/-! ## §6 — the CANARY: break the reduction and the keystone goes RED.

The sweep's lesson is that a floor consumer must be checked by asking whether it survives the WRONG
hypothesis. Under the OLD statement — `cellDigest_binds_cells (hLeaf : cellLeafInjective CH) …` — the
hypothesis was a FREE `Prop` that the conclusion never mentions, so no such canary was writable: the
floor and the conclusion did not share an object to disconnect. Here they cannot avoid it. -/

/-- **(CANARY — the keystone does NOT follow from the floors applied at OTHER adversaries.)** Strip the
reduction — try to conclude the equivocator's negligibility from the collision floors applied at some
OTHER finders `B`, `C`, `D`, `E`, NOT the ones extracted from it — and the proof does not go through: the
floors bound `B`/`C`/`D`/`E`, and only `sc_adv_le` connects the EXTRACTED four to the equivocation game.
The `negl_add` chain proves `Negl` of the WRONG advantage sum, so it cannot close
`Negl (gameAdv (scEquivGame F) A)`. This tooth was impossible to write under the old free
`cellLeafInjective` hypothesis; it compiles now, and REDS if a future edit reconnects the games. -/

/-- **(TOOTH — the leaf floor is SATISFIABLE, vacuously.)** At the empty adversary class it holds for any

The real content, and the reason `Eff` is not decoration: if at every sampled instance two distinct
`Value`s share a leaf — which §1 proves pigeonhole FORCES at BabyBear — then the floor at `Eff := ⊤` is
FALSE, and the keystone is vacuous there. This is the price of `hEffLeaf`, stated as a theorem instead of
a promise. -/

Same price for the 2-to-1 horn: two field elements do not fit in one
(`HashFloorHonesty.compressInjective_false_of_finite_range` is the injective-shape sibling of this). -/

The third horn's price — `List ℤ` is infinite and the squeeze is one field element. -/

/-! ## §8 — ⚑ the OLD floor is WEAKER than its family, and the reduction stays on the DIAGONAL.

The usual re-grounding note is "the old injective floor implies the new one, so it was strictly stronger
and, being false, empty" (`HashFloorHonesty.commitRevealFamily_CR_of_hashcr` for the flagged siblings).
**That note is FALSE here, and saying so is the point.** `cellLeafInjective CH` is injectivity in the
`Value` at a FIXED cell — it says NOTHING about `CH c v = CH c' w` for `c ≠ c'`. So it does NOT discharge
`CollisionResistant (scLeafFamily F)`, whose game admits cross-cell collisions: the old carrier is not
merely false, it is not even the right shape for its own family.

What saves the reduction is that it never needs the cross-cell case: `scToLeafAdv` outputs a DIAGONAL
pair by construction (`scToLeafAdv_diagonal`), because the cell where two maps differ is ONE cell. So the
leaf floor is consumed exactly on the diagonal — precisely the property `cellLeafInjective` was claiming
for free, now paid for as a collision advantage. The `EffLeaf` class the keystone quantifies over may
therefore be taken to contain only diagonal finders without weakening the bound. -/

/-- **The extracted leaf finder is DIAGONAL** — it always outputs two `(cell, value)` pairs at the SAME
cell. So `stateCommit_equivocation_advantage_bound` consumes the leaf collision floor only on the
diagonal, which is exactly the surface `cellLeafInjective` claimed to cover — no cross-cell strength is
smuggled in, and the floor may be restricted to diagonal finders without weakening the keystone. -/
