# Dregg2.Consensus.Safety — CONSENSUS SAFETY at the CHAIN level: no two honest nodes
# finalize CONFLICTING histories.

**The gap this closes — the chain-level sibling of `lightclient_unfoolable`.**
`Circuit.CircuitSoundness.lightclient_unfoolable` proves a single accepted TURN witnesses a
genuine kernel transition — per-turn *validity*. It does NOT say WHICH chain is canonical.
Every consensus-safety theorem already in the tree fixes ONE lace / ONE state:

* `Proof.BFT.bft_safety` — over one `votes` pool: two conflicting blocks cannot both reach a
  BFT quorum (quorum-intersection at an honest process).
* `Proof.CordialMiners.cordial_agreement` / `…_from_lace` — over ONE `CordialState`: a wave
  anchors a single super-ratified leader (the quorum read off that lace).
* `Distributed.BlocklaceFinality.finalLeaders_one_per_wave` / `tauOrder_deterministic` — over
  ONE `Lace`: a wave has ≤ 1 final leader; the order is a function of (lace, participants).
* `Consensus.TauPrefixMonotone.tau_finalized_prefix_monotone` — over ONE lace's GROWTH: the
  finalized prefix is append-only *under* `FinalizedRegionStable` (and refuted unconditionally).

What NONE of them state is the property a LIGHT CLIENT'S CHAIN-CHOICE actually rests on:
**two honest nodes, holding DIFFERENT (partial) laces `S₁ ≠ S₂`, cannot finalize conflicting
leaders at the same wave — so their finalized HISTORIES never disagree.** A client that follows
either node's finalized chain lands on the SAME history; there is no fork it can be split across.

This module supplies that apex. The honest observation that makes it tractable: the proof of
`cordial_agreement` never uses that its two super-ratifications come from the *same* state — it
consumes only the two ratifier vote pools, the BFT honest-majority model over their union, the
honesty law, and id-determinism. So the cross-node lift is a genuine generalization, not a
re-proof: §1 isolates the pure two-pool quorum-intersection kernel (`quorum_pair_agreement`,
the generalization of `bft_safety` from one pool to two independent pools), §2 lifts it to two
`CordialState`s, §3 reads the quorum off each node's lace (`Committed`, via the existing
`SuperRatification.ofLace`), and §4 composes per-wave agreement into the chain-level
`no_conflicting_finalized_history`.

## CARRIERS (hypotheses, never `axiom`s — the honest floor).

* **Honest majority / `n > 3f`.** Carried by `BFT.BFTModel` over the UNION of the two nodes'
  ratification pools (its `bft_threshold`, `fault_bound`, `population_bound`, `honest_vote_once`
  fields). This is the standard BFT floor; deriving that the union actually meets it is the
  post-GST dissemination argument (the same residual `BFT.lean`'s O2 and
  `cordial_agreement_from_lace` name) — off the safety-critical path, NOT an open hole here.
* **Shared participant universe.** The two nodes count ratifiers over the same participant id
  set, so two `≥ n − f` pools intersect in an honest participant. Carried implicitly by the
  single `Finality.Config` both pools are read against.
* **CROSS-NODE content-addressing** (`CrossNodeCanonical S₁ S₂`, §0): a block held by node 1 and
  a block held by node 2 that share an id ARE THE SAME BLOCK. This is what discharges the
  per-pair `hid_inj : LeaderIdPins l₁ l₂` at every cross-node site.

  ⚑ **This doc-comment used to say `Lace.Canonical` at the anchor. That was WRONG, and the
  correction is the point of the 2026-07-28 repair.** `l₁` comes from node 1's lace and `l₂`
  from node 2's; `Lace.Canonical` constrains two blocks WITHIN ONE lace and says nothing about
  an id present in both. `Model.crossNodeCanonical_is_the_gap` (§5) exhibits two node laces that
  are EACH `Lace.Canonical`, each genuinely commits a leader at wave 0, share a cross-node BFT
  model — and whose anchors are DIFFERENT BLOCKS AT THE SAME ADDRESS, so `LeaderIdPins` fails
  and the two finalized histories DISAGREE. The assumption is the one a content-address
  collision breaks, and breaking it splits the light client across a fork. It is
  `Distributed.LaceMerge.CrossCanonical` read on the two nodes' laces — the same assumption the
  CRDT-convergence lane named on 2026-07-27, consumed here at the consensus layer.

NAMED RESIDUAL (a closure lane, not faked): bridging `BlocklaceFinality.isSuperRatified` (the
`Bool` the node computes) to the `CordialMiners.Committed`/`superRatifiedFromLace` evidence this
module consumes is the `OPEN-CM-SUPERRATIFY-BRIDGE` — the two parallel finalization models
(`Proof.CordialMiners` = the BFT algebra, `Distributed.BlocklaceFinality` = the executable rule)
share the `n − f` ratifier-count shape; this module proves safety on the algebra side, where the
quorum is read off the lace via `SuperRatification.ofLace`. The bridge lands the same conclusion
on the executable rule; it is the next rung, not an assumed step.

## THE VACUITY THIS FILE CARRIED UNTIL 2026-07-28, AND WHAT REPLACED IT.

`no_conflicting_finalized_history`'s only hypothesis was a `CrossNodeWitness`, and
`CrossNodeWitness` was **INHABITED NOWHERE IN THE TREE** — zero constructions, zero `hid_inj :=`.
The apex quantified over an empty premise. §5's "non-vacuity" did not rescue it: it showed the §1
kernel firing (its own hypotheses still assumed as binders) and `Consistent` being two-sided, and
never once inhabited the apex's hypothesis. That is the `CrossSchemeSameOpening` disease — a
consumer with no model.

What is here now:
* `Model.crossWitness` — **a real `CrossNodeWitness`**, at two nodes holding GENUINELY DIFFERENT
  laces (neither view contains the other's wave-end observer), each committing the wave-0 leader
  off its own blocks, with a cross-node BFT model carrying an ACTUAL Byzantine ratifier at the
  `f = 1` budget. Every field derived; nothing assumed.
* `Model.apex_fires_on_two_nodes` — the APEX ITSELF applied to that witness. The chain-safety
  conclusion is reached on real data, not merely stated.
* `crossNodeBftOfCommitted` — a general theorem, not a fixture: the cross-node BFT carrier is
  INHABITED whenever the two nodes share a bounded participant universe with ≤ f corrupt and both
  committed the same anchor id. (At DIFFERENT anchor ids with both quorums met it is not
  inhabitable — that is precisely what `quorum_pair_agreement` refutes. The scope is honest, not
  a convenience.)
* `no_conflicting_finalized_history_of_committed` — the apex with the histories TIED to the nodes
  (`FinalizedBy`) and cross-node canonicity stated ONCE at the lace level instead of per pair.
  The old apex never related `h₁` to `S₁` at all: it was a statement about two arbitrary lists.

## WHAT CHAIN SAFETY THIS DOES *NOT* ESTABLISH — read before citing.

1. **Not on the rule the node runs.** Safety is proved on the BFT algebra
   (`CordialMiners.Committed` / `superRatifiedFromLace`). Bridging to
   `Distributed.BlocklaceFinality.isSuperRatified`, the `Bool` a node actually computes, is the
   still-open `OPEN-CM-SUPERRATIFY-BRIDGE` below. Nothing here says the deployed finalizer obeys
   the theorem.
2. **The BFT model over the UNION remains an assumption in the case that matters.**
   `crossNodeBftOfCommitted` inhabits it only when both nodes committed the SAME anchor id; at
   DIFFERENT ids with both quorums met it is uninhabitable, which is the whole force of
   `quorum_pair_agreement` but also means the carrier is *never discharged from the runtime*.
   Whether two honest nodes' actual ratifier pools meet `n > 3f` / `≤ f` corrupt over their union
   is the post-GST dissemination residual — unchanged by this repair.
3. **`CrossNodeCanonical` is backed by nothing in-tree.** It is collision resistance over the
   block encoding at the point consensus consumes it; this tree does not prove that. It is
   decidable, so a node can check it against a peer's blocks — that is what naming it buys, and
   it is all it buys.
4. **The model is a toy.** `n = 4, f = 1`, one wave, one leader, six blocks. It settles
   satisfiability and refutability; it is not a scale claim.

/-! ## §0. `CrossNodeCanonical` — the assumption `hid_inj` ACTUALLY is.

Nine sites in this file and `Proof.CordialMiners` carried `hid_inj : l₁.id = l₂.id → l₁ = l₂` as
an anonymous binder, doc-commented "`Lace.Canonical` at the anchor". At the CROSS-NODE sites that
attribution is wrong: `l₁` is read off node 1's lace and `l₂` off node 2's, and `Lace.Canonical`
is a statement about two blocks inside ONE lace. The assumption that pins two DIFFERENT nodes'
anchors is cross-lace canonicity — `Distributed.LaceMerge.CrossCanonical`, named by the CRDT
lane on 2026-07-27 for exactly the same mis-attribution on the convergence side. We reuse it
rather than mint a second shape, and prove the per-pair form is its consequence. -/

boundary: a block node 1 holds and a block node 2 holds that share a content-address ARE THE SAME

layer consuming the assumption the CRDT layer already named.

It is NOT implied by the two laces being each `Lace.Canonical`
(`Model.crossNodeCanonical_is_the_gap`), it is NOT a crypto axiom, and it is NOT a theorem: the
wire-format fact that makes it hold is collision resistance over the block encoding, which this

/-! ## §1. The pure two-pool quorum-intersection kernel.

`BFT.bft_safety` lives over a SINGLE `votes` pool — it answers "can two conflicting blocks both
reach a quorum *in one node's view*?". The chain-level question is over TWO views: node 1's
ratifier pool `v1` for `b1`, node 2's pool `v2` for `b2`. We monotone-lift each quorum onto the
UNION pool `v1 ++ v2` and run the classical intersection there: the honest witness ratified
across the union, so the honesty law collapses `b1 = b2`. This is `bft_safety` generalized from
one pool to two independent pools — the genuinely new kernel the chain apex needs. -/

/-- A node's ratifier read over `v1` is preserved when its pool is appended to another node's

quorum `n − f`. Under a `BFTModel` over their UNION (the honest-majority floor, shared
participant universe) and the honesty law (an honest participant who ratified across the union
ratified a single block), the two pools cannot endorse distinct blocks: `b1 = b2`.

This is `BFT.bft_safety` lifted from one pool to two: the two `n − f` quorums, monotone-lifted
onto `v1 ++ v2`, still meet `n − f`, so `honest_witness_in_intersection` produces an honest
participant in both — who then ratified both blocks. The classical quorum-intersection floor
does ALL the work; what is new is that the two quorums are read from DIFFERENT nodes' views. -/

the BFT feeder (`SuperRatification.ofLace`, count preserved) and run §2. The quorum the safety

/-! ### §3b. The cross-node BFT carrier IS INHABITABLE — generally, not just at a fixture.

Every theorem above takes `M : BFTModel cfg (…ofLace h₁.some… ++ …ofLace h₂.some…)`. That type
mentions `Committed.some`, a `Classical.choice` extraction whose observer nobody can name, and
until this section nothing in the tree ever produced such an `M`. The satisfiability question is
therefore not decoration: if that type were empty, every cross-node theorem here — and the apex
above them — would be vacuous.

It is not empty, and the reason is structural rather than fixture-specific: whichever observer
`Committed.some` hands us, the ratifier set it reads is a `filter`+`dedup` of that node's
PARTICIPANT list (`ratifyingVoters_subset_participants`), so the union pool's voters are bounded
by the two participant lists no matter what. That is enough for `population_bound` and
`fault_bound`; `honest_vote_once` comes free because every materialized vote endorses the anchor
it was built for.

**The scope is honest.** The construction needs `l₂.id = l₁.id`. At DIFFERENT anchor ids, with
both `n − f` quorums met over a shared participant universe, the model is genuinely
UNINHABITABLE — that is exactly what `quorum_pair_agreement` proves. So this is not a
convenience assumption dodging the hard case; the hard case is the theorem. -/

/-- **`crossNodeBftOfCommitted` — the cross-node honest-majority carrier, CONSTRUCTED.** Given
two nodes' commit facts at the SAME anchor id, a shared participant universe of size ≤ `n` with
at most `f` corrupt in it, and the BFT floor `n > 3f`, the `BFTModel` over the union of the two
lace-derived ratifier pools EXISTS. Works for the opaque `Committed.some` observers, because it
only ever uses that a ratifier set is drawn from its node's participants. -/

A node's FINALIZED HISTORY is its wave-indexed sequence of committed leaders (the `tauOrder`
anchors, keyed by wave). Two histories CONFLICT iff they disagree on the leader of some common
wave. The apex: under the per-wave cross-node witness (each node committed its leader + the
cross-node honest-majority BFT model), the histories are CONSISTENT — never disagree. A light
client following either node's finalized chain lands on the same history. -/

/-- A node's finalized history: per wave index, the leader block it committed (the `tauOrder`
anchors of `findAllFinalLeaders`, keyed by wave). -/
abbrev FinalizedHistory := List (Nat × Block)

/-- The leader a history finalized at wave `w` (the first entry tagged `w`, if any). -/
def leaderAtWave (h : FinalizedHistory) (w : Nat) : Option Block :=
  (h.find? (fun e => e.1 == w)).map (·.2)

/-- **`Consistent h₁ h₂`** — two finalized histories never disagree at a common wave. This is
the chain-level "no fork": both nodes' canonical chains coincide wherever both have finalized. -/
def Consistent (h₁ h₂ : FinalizedHistory) : Prop :=
  ∀ w l₁ l₂, leaderAtWave h₁ w = some l₁ → leaderAtWave h₂ w = some l₂ → l₁ = l₂

/-- **`CrossNodeWitness`** — the per-wave evidence the chain apex consumes for a common wave:
both nodes committed their leader (`Committed`, quorum read off the lace), the cross-node BFT
honest-majority model over the materialized union pool, and id-determinism. This bundles exactly
the carriers named in the header — no `axiom`. -/
structure CrossNodeWitness (cfg : Finality.Config) (S₁ S₂ : CordialState) (l₁ l₂ : Block) where
  /-- Node 1's lace exhibits the ratifying quorum for `l₁`. -/

  /-- **CROSS-NODE content-addressing at the anchor pair.** `l₁` is node 1's anchor and `l₂` is
  node 2's, so the assumption that pins them is `CrossNodeCanonical S₁ S₂` restricted to this
  pair (`CrossNodeCanonical.leaderIdPins`), NOT `Lace.Canonical` of either node's lace — this
  field's docstring said the latter until 2026-07-28 and `Model.crossNodeCanonical_is_the_gap`
  refutes it. -/

/-- **`no_conflicting_finalized_history` — chain safety in the PER-PAIR WITNESS form.** If, at
every wave both histories finalized, a `CrossNodeWitness` holds (both nodes committed + the
union honest-majority BFT model + cross-node content-addressing at that pair), then the two
histories are CONSISTENT: they never disagree on a finalized wave's leader.

⚑ **Read the hypothesis literally: this statement does NOT tie `hᵢ` to `Sᵢ`.** Nothing here says
`h₁` is the history node 1 finalized — the states enter only through the witness supplier. The
theorem is true and useful (`Model.apex_fires_on_two_nodes` runs it on the exhibited witness),
but the sentence "two honest nodes' finalized histories never disagree" is carried by
`no_conflicting_finalized_history_of_committed` below, which does carry the tie. Cite THAT as
the apex. -/

/-! ### §4b. The apex with the histories TIED TO THE NODES.

`no_conflicting_finalized_history` takes `S₁ S₂ : CordialState` and `h₁ h₂ : FinalizedHistory`
and NEVER RELATES THEM: nothing says `h₁` is the history node 1 finalized. Read literally it is a
statement about two arbitrary lists whose every compared pair happens to come with a witness. The
prose ("two honest nodes with laces `S₁, S₂` and finalized histories `h₁, h₂`") claimed the tie;
the statement did not carry it.

`FinalizedBy` carries it: every leader the history lists at a wave is a block the node ACTUALLY
COMMITTED off its own lace. With the tie in place the per-pair `hid_inj` dissolves into ONE
lace-level `CrossNodeCanonical S₁ S₂` — membership of each anchor in its own lace is *derived*
from the commit fact (`committed_mem_lace`), not assumed. -/

/-- **`FinalizedBy S cfg h`** — `h` is the history THIS node finalized: every leader it lists at
a wave is `Committed` on `S`'s own lace (the `≥ n − f` ratifier read, `findAllFinalLeaders`
pushing the block onto `final_leaders`). -/
def FinalizedBy (S : CordialState) (cfg : Finality.Config) (h : FinalizedHistory) : Prop :=
  ∀ w l, leaderAtWave h w = some l → Committed S cfg l

/-- Reading a leader off a history means the `(wave, leader)` pair IS in the list — the bridge
between `leaderAtWave` and the concrete histories the model exhibits. -/

/-- **`no_conflicting_finalized_history_of_committed` — THE APEX, HISTORIES TIED TO NODES.**
Two nodes, each history being the one that node actually finalized (`FinalizedBy`), a shared
`n > 3f` config, ONE cross-node content-addressing assumption at the lace level, and the
cross-node BFT model for the pairs actually compared. Conclusion: the two finalized histories
never disagree — no fork a light client can be split across.

Against the older apex this (i) TIES `hᵢ` to `Sᵢ`, which the older statement did not, and
(ii) replaces the per-pair `hid_inj` by the single named `CrossNodeCanonical S₁ S₂`, with each
anchor's lace-membership DERIVED from its commit fact. Its carriers are strictly the header's
three, stated once each. -/

/-! ## §5b. THE MODEL — two real nodes, a real `CrossNodeWitness`, and the tooth.

§5 above shows the §1 kernel firing and `Consistent` being two-sided. Neither of those touches
the apex's hypothesis, and until 2026-07-28 `CrossNodeWitness` was inhabited NOWHERE IN THE
TREE — so `no_conflicting_finalized_history` proved nothing about anything. This section closes
that, on the three-arm discipline (`feedback-prove-the-floor-false`):

* **SATISFIABLE** — `crossWitness` is a `CrossNodeWitness` at two nodes holding GENUINELY
  DIFFERENT laces (`node1_lace_ne_node2`; neither view holds the other's wave-end observer), each
  committing the wave-0 leader off its OWN blocks, with a cross-node BFT model carrying an actual
  Byzantine ratifier at the `f = 1` budget. `apex_fires_on_two_nodes` and
  `tied_apex_fires_on_two_nodes` run the two apexes on it.
* **REFUTABLE, and the refutation is the mis-attribution's counterexample** —
  `crossNodeCanonical_is_the_gap`: node 1 and a forked node whose laces are EACH
  `Lace.Canonical`, which each genuinely `Committed` a wave-0 leader off their own blocks, which
  share a cross-node BFT model — and whose anchors are DIFFERENT BLOCKS AT THE SAME
  CONTENT-ADDRESS (`signed` flipped, one bit). `CrossNodeCanonical` fails, `LeaderIdPins` fails
  with it, `Consistent` FAILS, and no `CrossNodeWitness` exists for that pair. Per-lace
  canonicity does NOT rescue chain safety, which is exactly what the old doc-comment claimed.
* **Therefore NOT PROVABLE**, and decidable: a node can CHECK `CrossNodeCanonical` against a
  peer's blocks (`decidableCrossNodeCanonical`).

The two nodes reuse `Proof.CordialMiners.Inhabited`'s lace — the leader strand `rg0 ≺ rg1`, the
three approvers `ra0/ra1/ra2` — and differ in their wave-end observer, which is what "two honest
nodes with different partial views" means concretely. -/

/-! ### THE TOOTH — the same setup with ONE BIT flipped at the leader's content-address.

`rg1Forged` is the leader block at address `101` with `signed := false`. A node whose gossip
delivered the forged strand builds a lace that is INTERNALLY content-addressed, ratifies the
block it holds, and commits it. Everything the apex asks for is present on both sides EXCEPT
cross-node canonicity — and the two finalized histories disagree at wave 0. -/

/-- **`crossNodeCanonical_is_the_gap` — THE TOOTH.** Everything the chain-safety apex asks for is
present on both sides: each node's lace is `Lace.Canonical`, each node genuinely `Committed` its
wave-0 leader off its own blocks, and they share a cross-node honest-majority BFT model. The ONE
thing that fails is `CrossNodeCanonical` — and with it `LeaderIdPins`, the `CrossNodeWitness`,
and `Consistent`. The two nodes finalize DIFFERENT BLOCKS at the SAME wave, and a light client
following either is on a different chain.

So: per-lace `Lace.Canonical` does NOT give chain safety, which is precisely what the `hid_inj`
doc-comments claimed until 2026-07-28. The assumption is CROSS-node, it is load-bearing, it is
refutable, and it is therefore not provable — an assumption, and now a checkable one. -/
