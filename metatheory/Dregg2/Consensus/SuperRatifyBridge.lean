# Dregg2.Consensus.SuperRatifyBridge — `OPEN-CM-SUPERRATIFY-BRIDGE`, closed as far as it
# closes: from the finalizer THE NODE RUNS to the finalizer THE SAFETY THEOREM PROVES.

`Consensus.Safety` proves chain safety on `Proof.CordialMiners.Committed` — the BFT algebra.
The node does not run that. The node runs `Distributed.BlocklaceFinality.tauOrderFast`
(`@[export] dregg_tau_order`, `node/src/finality_gate.rs`), whose commit decision is
`finalLeaderAt` → `isSuperRatified`. Nothing in the tree said the second obeys the first. This
module states the exact mismatch, proves the implication that does hold, and names + models the
hypotheses it does not.

## THE MISMATCH, axis by axis (§1 states each as a theorem or a refutation).

| | deployed (`isSuperRatified`/`finalLeaderAt`) | proved (`Committed`) | direction |
|-|-|-|-|
|outer quorum|supermajority of DISTINCT **ENROLLED** wave-end creators, each `ratifies`|**one** observer anywhere in the lace|deployed STRONGER|
|inner threshold|`superMajority n = ⌊2n/3⌋+1`|`cfg.n − cfg.f`|**incomparable**|
|leader-in-past|`causal_past_INCLUSIVE`|(was strict `≺`; repaired 2026-07-28)|now agree|
|equivocation guard|observer-LOCAL, same-ROUND pair in `o`'s past|GLOBAL `Equivocator` = incomparable pair anywhere|**incomparable**|
|unique leader|`leaderCandidates = [l]` — lives in `finalLeaderAt`|`unique_leader` field|`isSuperRatified` alone has NONE|
|id → block|`BlockId` + `lookup`|`Block`|needs `Lace.Canonical`|

**So `isSuperRatified` and `Committed` are INCOMPARABLE, and `isSuperRatified` is the wrong
object to bridge from** — it carries no unique-leader guard at all (`superRatified_alone_is_not_committed`).
`finalLeaderAt` is the right one: it is where `leader_blocks.len() == 1` lives, and it is what
`findAllFinalLeaders`/`tauOrder` actually call.

## WHAT IS PROVED (§3): `committed_of_finalLeaderAt`.

    B.Canonical → participants.Nodup → ThresholdAgrees cfg participants →
    LeaderNotGlobalEquivocator B l → finalLeaderAt B participants wave wavelength = some l →
    Committed (deployedState B participants wavelength) cfg l

and its lift `finalizedBy_deployedHistory` : the history the node's own wave loop produces
satisfies the apex's `FinalizedBy` premise; and the capstone
`deployed_nodes_no_conflicting_history` : **two nodes each running the deployed finalizer never
disagree on a finalized wave's leader** — the apex, reached from the deployed rule.

## THE TWO HYPOTHESES THIS COSTS — NAMED, MODELLED, REFUTED (§2, §4).

1. **`ThresholdAgrees cfg participants`** — `cfg.n − cfg.f ≤ superMajority participants.length`.
   The deployed rule counts against `⌊2n/3⌋+1`; the algebra's quorum field is `n − f`. They
   coincide EXACTLY on `3f+1 ≤ n ≤ 3f+3` (`thresholdAgrees_of_canonical_bft`) and the upper
   bound is TIGHT (`thresholdAgrees_fails_at_3f_plus_4`): at `n = 7, f = 1` the node finalizes on
   5 ratifiers where the algebra demands 6. Decidable, satisfiable, refutable.
2. **`LeaderNotGlobalEquivocator B l`** — `¬ Equivocator B l.creator`. The node's guard
   (`hasEquivInPast`) is OBSERVER-LOCAL and keyed on a same-ROUND pair; `Equivocator` is GLOBAL
   and keyed on an INCOMPARABLE pair. `Model.forked` exhibits a lace where a full supermajority
   of the node's ratifiers ratify the leader (`forked_node_still_ratifies`, by `decide`) while
   `Equivocator` holds and therefore `Committed` is FALSE (`forked_is_not_committed`). **This is
   a COVERAGE HOLE, not an attack**: the deployed rule is the more faithful of the two here (a
   node can only act on what it sees), so the honest reading is that the ALGEBRA is over-strong
   and the safety theorem is silent on those runs. The repair — teaching `CordialState.approves`
   the observer-local guard — is `OPEN-CM-LOCAL-EQUIVOCATION`, named and NOT done here.

## WHAT THE KERNEL CANNOT SEE — read before trusting a `#guard`.

`roundOf` → `computeRounds` → `Array.qsort`, which is well-founded-recursive and whose worker
(`_private.Init.Data.Array.QSort.Basic.0.Array.qsort.sort`) is private to `Init`, so it is
irreducible and **unsealable from here**. Measured 2026-07-28: `decide` gets stuck on
`roundOf pB 100 = 1`. Consequence: **no Lean THEOREM in this tree can evaluate the deployed
finalizer on a concrete lace** — every `#guard` about `tauOrder`/`isSuperRatified` runs in the
COMPILER, outside the kernel, and is a test, not a proof. §4's models are therefore built to be
round-FREE where they are theorems (they turn on `Lace`-structural facts and `causalPastIncl`,
both of which DO reduce), and the round-dependent facts appear only as `#guard`s, labelled.

## SCOPE — what this does NOT do.

* It does not discharge the union BFT model, and it does not discharge `CrossNodeCanonical`.
  The capstone carries both, exactly as the apex does.
* `Model.*` is `n = 4, f = 1`, one wave. Satisfiability and refutability, NOT scale. The bridge
  theorem itself is fully general in `n`, `f`, `B` and `participants`.
* `OPEN-CM-LOCAL-EQUIVOCATION` (above) is open. Until it closes, a node that finalizes a leader
  whose author forked OUTSIDE every honest observer's causal past is finalizing OUTSIDE the
  safety theorem's domain.

/-! ## §0. Structural facts about `precedes` the models need (no decidability required).

`precedes` is an inductive `Prop` (the transitive closure of `pointed`), so `decide` cannot
refute it. These two lemmas are what let a concrete lace prove `¬ precedes` — and therefore
`incomparable`, and therefore `Equivocator`. -/

/-- **`precedes_preds_ne_nil`** — nothing precedes a block with no predecessors. The base case
puts `a.id` in `b.preds`; `trans` inherits the right-hand end. A genesis block is a leaf of `≺`. -/

/-- **`precedes_inv`** — one step down. If `a ≺ b` then some predecessor id `p` of `b` either IS
`a`, or resolves to a block `m` with `a ≺ m`. Inverting the transitive closure from the TOP,
which is what a concrete lace can iterate. -/

/-! ## §1. `causalPastIncl` is SOUND for `precedes` — the id-level BFS meets the Prop-level order.

`ordering.rs::causal_past_inclusive` is a fuel-bounded BFS over `BlockId`s; `Committed` is stated
with `Authority.Blocklace.precedes`, an inductive `Prop` over `Block`s. Every step of the bridge
crosses that boundary. Nothing in the tree had crossed it before. -/

Everything here that is a THEOREM is round-FREE: `roundOf` goes through `Array.qsort`, which the

not proofs — and are labelled as such. -/

/-- An independent genesis block by an ENROLLED author (`2`) that does NOT observe the leader —
present in `forked` ONLY, so `honest` and every theorem about it are untouched.

⚑ **Why it exists** (the participant-filtered wave clock, `BlocklaceFinality.computeRounds`). This
model's fork used to attach to `other`, a NON-PARTICIPANT genesis. Under the pre-filter recurrence
that gave the fork round `2` and the leader slot (round `1`) stayed a singleton, so the node
finalized and §4b's coverage hole had its witness. Under the filtered clock a block whose ENTIRE
ancestry is outside the committee has committee-depth `0` and sits at round `1` — so the fork
collides with `leader` AT THE LEADER SLOT, `leader_blocks.len() == 1` fails, and the node correctly
refuses the wave. That is a STRENGTHENING (a fork rooted wholly outside the committee is now visible
where it decides something), and it is NOT a closure of `OPEN-CM-LOCAL-EQUIVOCATION`: a fork with
genuine in-committee depth still sits at its own round and is still invisible to the observer-local
guard. `freeBlk` gives this fork exactly that depth, so the witness keeps witnessing the hole that
is actually open rather than one the clock now catches. -/

/-! ### 4a. SATISFIABILITY — the bridge FIRES, kernel-checked, on the honest lace.

`ratifies` is round-free HERE by construction: the equivocation guard scans the author-`7` blocks
in the observer's past, of which there is exactly ONE, so the `a.id ≠ b.id` test short-circuits
before `roundOf` is ever forced. This is why the model puts the leader on its own author. -/

/-- **The bridge's premises are JOINTLY SATISFIABLE and its conclusion is REACHED.** No
`finalLeaderAt` here — that would force `roundOf`; the model feeds the round-free core directly,
with the unique-leader guard discharged from the lace and holding for EVERY round map. -/

Same lace plus one hidden author-`7` fork. The node's observer `ro0` is UNCHANGED and still
ratifies at the full supermajority (its causal past does not contain the fork, so
`hasEquivInPast` is blind to it). The algebra's `Equivocator` is global, sees it, and empties the
ratifier list. -/

It carries no unique-leader guard, so it cannot imply `Committed` on any lace where the leader
slot is contested. Stated round-free: whatever the round map, if two distinct blocks by the
leader's author share a round, `unique_leader` fails and `Committed` is false — while
`isSuperRatified` (which never looks at the leader slot) is untouched. -/

/-- **`superRatified_alone_is_not_committed`** — a leader-slot equivocation refutes `Committed`
without touching the ratifier read at all. `isSuperRatified` inspects only wave-END blocks; the
guard that would catch this lives in `finalLeaderAt`, which is why the bridge is stated there. -/
