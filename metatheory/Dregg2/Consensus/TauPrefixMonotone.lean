# Dregg2.Consensus.TauPrefixMonotone — T5: finalized-prefix monotonicity for `tauOrder`,
# with two of its three former hypotheses DISCHARGED and the third named as the paper's theorem.

**The claim (CM Prop. 9).** *Let B be a cordial blocklace with a supermajority of correct miners.
Then τ is monotonic wrt the superset relation among closed subsets of B, namely for any two closed
blocklaces B₂ ⊆ B₁ ⊆ B, τ(B₂) ⪯ τ(B₁).* The live node relies on it: `ExecutionCursor` caches the
finalized prefix, which CM §5 p.9 explicitly authorises **because of Prop. 9** — *"a sequence up to
a super-ratified leader is final (Prop. 9) and hence can be cached"*.

## What this module used to say, and why it changed

It carried `FinalizedRegionStable`, a THREE-field hypothesis, and a counterexample —
`lagBase → lagGrown`, four validators with one merely LAGGING, no Byzantine step, every block
passing the verified `insert` — refuting the unconditional claim:

```
  tauOrder lagBase   = [10,20,30,40,11,21,31,12,22,32]
  tauOrder lagGrown  = [10,20,30,40,11,21,31,41,12,22,32,42]     -- 41 lands at index 7
```

That counterexample was not a fact about Cordial Miners. It was a fact about a τ that had **deviated
from CM Def. 6**: a wave's segment was its leader's *coverage* — the union of the causal pasts of
every wave-END block **in the live lace** that ratified it — and coverage grows with arrivals. CM's
τ orders the anchor's OWN closure `[b₁] \ [b₂]` (Alg. 2:37), a set fixed forever by `b₁`'s signed
hash pointers, and folds over the ratified-leader chain reachable from ONE head (Alg. 2:41-46),
never over a leader list recomputed from the live lace.

`Distributed.BlocklaceFinality` §5b/§6 is now that rule. **On the same trace, with the same
validator lagging the same way, `tauOrder lagBase = tauOrder lagGrown = [10]`** — the growth adds
nothing to the anchor's closure because it cannot, and the §4 guards below pin it. The
counterexample is retained, inverted: it is now the module's positive exhibit that an
insert-valid honest laggard can no longer reorder finalized history.

## What is proved here, and what is still assumed

`FinalizedRegionStable`'s three fields, against CM:

| former field | what it said | status now |
|---|---|---|
| `fold_agrees` | replaying the old anchors in the grown lace reproduces the same segments | **THEOREM** (`tauStep_stable`), from `ClosedExtension` alone |
| `enrollment_agrees` | the growth does not reclassify an already-ordered block's creator | **THEOREM** (`enrolledId_stable` + `tauOrderUnfiltered_mem`), from `ClosedExtension` alone |
| `leaders_extend` | the anchor list only extends | **SURVIVES**, as `ChainExtends` — see below |

`ClosedExtension` is not a restatement of the conclusion. It is three STRUCTURAL facts about the
growth — the lace is extended, block ids are unique, and every predecessor of a held block is held —
and the third is exactly CM Def. 19's *closed*, which CM Alg. 3:49 establishes by BUFFERING
(*"Received 'out of order' blocks are buffered"*) and which `node/src/catchup.rs::apply_with_buffering`
already implements. Nothing here is a runtime stability check over two whole laces; the old
`stableCheck`, which nothing ever called, is deleted.

**The surviving hypothesis, named honestly.** `ChainExtends` says the old head appears in the new
head's ratified-leader chain, so the chains extend. That is precisely CM Prop. 9's central argument,
and CM DERIVES it: Prop. 3 (*a cordial blocklace is leader-safe*) gives that every final leader is
ratified by every subsequent leader, from **cordiality alone** — a per-block admission predicate
(CM Def. 25, Alg. 1:15-16), which `Distributed.BlocklaceFinality` §5c now **defines**.

⚠ Defines, and nothing more: `isCordialBlock` carries no `@[export]`, and NOTHING on the receive
path evaluates it — `insert_checked` still never looks at the cardinality of a block's pointer set.
So cordiality is available as a predicate, not established as a fact, and the derivation below is
not yet open to us even in principle. §5c's own debt block says the same; this paragraph exists so
the two cannot drift apart. Three gaps stand between here and a Lean proof of `ChainExtends`:

0. **The premise is not enforced.** Wiring `isCordialBlock` into the receive path needs an FFI
   export and a refusal policy — unlike a missing predecessor, a cordiality failure is not fixable
   by waiting, so it cannot simply be buffered.

1. **Prop. 3 itself is not formalised.** Its proof is quorum intersection over the DAG (App. C, two
   cases on the relative depth of the ratifying supermajority) and it is a real formalisation, not a
   rewrite. It is the next piece of work, not a side condition.
2. **Our `finalLeaderAt` is not monotone, and CM's `final_leader` is.** CM Alg. 2:48 evaluates
   `super-ratifies` over a depth-bounded prefix that only grows, so finality only ever turns ON;
   ours returns `none` unless the leader slot holds EXACTLY ONE block, so a late second leader-slot
   block by an equivocating leader RETRACTS an already-anchored wave and can move the head
   backwards. CM handles that case by approval instead (§4.2 + Lem. 31: at most one of an
   equivocating pair can hold supermajority approval). Until that is changed, `ChainExtends` also
   absorbs head-monotonicity, and a live equivocating leader can still shorten τ.

So the honest summary is: **the arrival-dependence is gone and proved gone; the leader-safety half
is imported from the paper and owed a Lean proof.** That is a different position from assuming the
conclusion, which is where this module was.

Non-vacuity (the sanctioned `#guard` teeth for these executable defs; `native_decide` is banned):
  * §4 — the FORMER counterexample, now a positive: insert-valid, equivocation-free, and the old
    order IS a prefix of the new one, with the mechanism pinned (the anchor's closure did not move).
  * §5 — a real growth that orders strictly more (`trace3 → trace6`, 1 → 10 blocks), so the
    conclusion is non-trivial rather than a prefix of nothing.

/-! ## 1. The growth hypothesis — STRUCTURAL, and established at admission.

`ClosedExtension B B'` is what a node's receive path already guarantees, stated as three facts
about the pair rather than as a property of the finalized order:

* `grown` — `B'` extends `B` (the blocklace is a grow-only set; `World.recv_mono`);
* `ids_nodup` — block ids are unique, i.e. content addressing (`Lace.Canonical`'s list form);
* `pred_closed` — every predecessor of a held block is held. **CM Def. 19 *closed*.** CM Alg. 3:49
  makes it a precondition of receipt and buffers what fails it; `blocklace/src/finality.rs::
  insert_checked` returns `MissingPredecessor` and `node/src/catchup.rs::apply_with_buffering`
  parks the block in the `OrphanBuffer` until it holds.

Note what is NOT here: nothing about waves, nothing about arrival timing, nothing comparing two τ
folds. The whole arrival-independence result comes out of `pred_closed`. -/

ids are unique — but Lean has to be told. -/

The old field assumed the growth does not reclassify an already-ordered block's creator. It cannot:
`enrolledId` reads `Lace.lookup`, and §2 pinned that. What was missing was the OTHER half — that
every id the fold emits is one the lace already holds — and that needed membership to survive the
intra-segment sort, which is why `xsortBy` is now a `List.mergeSort` (`mem_xsortBy`). -/

/-! ## 7. T5 — finalized-prefix monotonicity, with ONE hypothesis.

`ChainExtends` is CM Prop. 9's central argument: the smaller lace's head `b̂₂` appears in the
recursion chain of the larger lace's head `b̂₁`, so the chains extend. CM derives it from Prop. 3
(leader-safety), which follows from CORDIALITY alone — a per-block admission predicate
(`Distributed.BlocklaceFinality.isCordialBlock`, CM Def. 25 / Alg. 1:15-16).

⚠ It is NOT proved here, and the module header says exactly what stands between it and a proof:
Prop. 3 needs a quorum-intersection formalisation over the DAG, and our `finalLeaderAt` is not
monotone in the way CM's `final_leader` is. This is one named import from the paper, where there
used to be three assumptions the deployed rule could not satisfy at all. -/

/-! ## 8. THE FORMER COUNTEREXAMPLE, INVERTED.

Four validators `[1,2,3,4]` (supermajority 3), wavelength 3. Validator 4 publishes its genesis block
`40`, then LAGS — a partition, a slow link, pure asynchrony, no fault. Validators 1–3 complete
rounds 2 and 3 and wave 0's leader (validator 1's genesis, block `10`) is super-ratified. THEN
validator 4 catches up: its round-2 block `41` and round-3 block `42` arrive, both passing every
verified-insert check, and `42` sits at wave 0's END round and ratifies leader `10`.

Under the RATIFIER-UNION rule that grew wave 0's coverage by `{41, 42}` and `xsort` placed `41`
(round 2) BEFORE round-3 blocks the node had already executed:

```
  tauOrder lagBase  = [10,20,30,40,11,21,31,12,22,32]
  tauOrder lagGrown = [10,20,30,40,11,21,31,41,12,22,32,42]     -- NOT a prefix
```

Under CM Def. 6 the anchor is block `10`, its closure is `{10}`, and `41`/`42` are not in it. Both
laces order `[10]`; the late blocks are ordered by a LATER anchor, after everything already emitted.
The guards below pin the whole chain of reasoning, not just the conclusion. -/
