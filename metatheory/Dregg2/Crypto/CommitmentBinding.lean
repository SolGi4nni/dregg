# Dregg2.Crypto.CommitmentBinding — the 2-to-1 compress + BLAKE3 cell-commitment binding, REDUCED.

Two more commitment portals discharged to their genuine primitives, completing the extension of
task #13 begun in `Dregg2.Crypto.SpongeReduction`:

  * **§1 — the Poseidon2 2-to-1 compression `compressInjective`** (the Merkle-node hash `hash_2_to_1`
    / the 4-to-1 `hash_4_to_1`, `circuit/src/poseidon2.rs:341,357`) REDUCED to the SAME single
    permutation-call CR as the sponge (`SpongeReduction.CompressionCR`): a 2-to-1 hash is `squeeze ∘
    perm ∘ pack₂`, i.e. ONE `step` over the packed two-input block, so `compressInjective` is just the
    `CompressionCR` collision peeled once. The `StateCommit.recStateCommit_binds` root-binding portal
    (`compressInjective cmb`) thereby stands on the permutation CR, NOT a separate assumption.

  * **§2 — the BLAKE3 cell-commitment v3/v4** (`cell/src/commitment.rs::compute_canonical_state_commitment`,
    a domain-separated `blake3::Hasher` absorbing a canonical byte layout) REDUCED to BLAKE3
    collision-resistance (`Crypto.PortalFloor.Blake3Kernel`, IRREDUCIBLE PRIMITIVE #5) composed with
    injectivity of the canonical SERIALIZATION (a STRUCTURAL field: the byte layout is prefix-free per
    field — `Some/None` tag bytes, the `auth_byte`+vk discipline, fixed-position absorptions). The
    binding "equal canonical commitments ⇒ equal cells" thus reduces to BLAKE3 CR, a named primitive,
    not a blanket assumption.

Classification (per the crypto-ledger discipline):
  * `compressInjective` — DISCHARGEABLE to the permutation `CompressionCR` (= primitive #4 for one
    `perm`), shared with the sponge. No new crypto.
  * BLAKE3 commitment binding — DISCHARGEABLE to BLAKE3 CR (IRREDUCIBLE PRIMITIVE #5), composed with a
    structural serialization injectivity. The hash CR is the named primitive; the serialization is
    proved injective (a `Reference` instance exhibits one).

l4v bar: every theorem pins `{propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}` (`#assert_axioms`).

/-! ## §1 — the 2-to-1 Poseidon2 compression `compressInjective` ⟸ the permutation `CompressionCR`.

`hash_2_to_1 left right` is `state[0]=left; state[1]=right; state[4]=2; permute(); state[0]`
(`poseidon2.rs:357`) — a SINGLE permutation call over the two-input rate block. We model it as one
`SpongeMachine.step` over the packed block `[left, right]`, so collision-resistance of the 2-to-1 hash
is the `CompressionCR` collision peeled once (plus the structural injectivity of the 2-element
packing). NO new crypto beyond the one permutation call. -/

/-- **`Compress1CR compress1`** — ⚠ **BROKEN / VACUOUS FOR A RANGE-BOUNDED COMPRESSION.**
Stated as injectivity of `List ℤ → ℤ`, which is FALSE by cardinality
(`Crypto.FactoryBindingFloorRegrounded.compress1CR_false_babyBear`) — `List ℤ` is infinite and a BabyBear
squeeze is one bounded field element. It is the same predicate as the already-flagged
`StateCommit.compressNInjective` / `Poseidon2Binding.Poseidon2SpongeCR`, and it shares their fate.

⚑ **WORSE THAN A HYPOTHESIS:** this is a FIELD of `Compress2` (`compress1CR`), so a deployed `Compress2`
VALUE CANNOT EXIST (`FactoryBindingFloorRegrounded.compress2_uninhabitable_babyBear`) — the
`Compress8CR`-in-`Cap8Scheme` shape `VACUITY-SWEEP.md` FINDING 2 named the priority. Consequence for
this file's own headline claim (§1 header: *"the `StateCommit.recStateCommit_binds` root-binding portal
thereby stands on the permutation CR, NOT a separate assumption"*): at BabyBear it stands on nothing —
`compressInjective_of_compress2`'s premise is uninhabitable, and only `Reference.refCompress2`
(`compress1 = Encodable.encode`, range NOT bounded) satisfies it. Toy witness satisfiable; real
instantiation false. KEPT for the record.

⚑ Honest replacement: `Crypto.FactoryBindingFloorRegrounded.compress2_node_advantage_bound` — a node-hash
collision finder reduces (by the injective packing) to a `compress1` collision finder, negligible under
`FloorGames.HashCRHardQuant _ Eff` at an EXPLICIT adversary class. NO new crypto: the sole content is
still the ONE permutation call (primitive #4), now stated as something an adversary must FIND. NOT
`HashFloorHonesty.CollisionResistant`, which is that floor at `⊤` and itself false
(`FloorGames.collisionResistant_false_of_compressing`).

As originally intended: a single-permutation-call compression `compress1 : List ℤ → ℤ`
(`squeeze ∘ perm ∘ absorb s0`) is collision-resistant: equal outputs force equal input blocks. The
squeeze-level reading of `SpongeReduction.CompressionCR` for the LAST (here: only) block — the same
one-permutation-call primitive #4, stated at the digest level for a fixed initial state. -/
