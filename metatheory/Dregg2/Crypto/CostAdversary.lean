# `Dregg2.Crypto.CostAdversary` — a COST MODEL that gives `Eff` in-logic content, at COST-VECTOR
resolution.

`FloorGames` §8 names the residual precisely and does NOT close it: the tree has no cost model, so the
adversary class `Eff` of `Hard G Eff := ∀ A, Eff A → Negl (gameAdv G A)` is a bare parameter. `§2`'s
`hard_top_iff_solvableFrac_negl` proves the escape is `Eff` and ONLY `Eff` — at `Eff := ⊤` the floor is
FALSE (a brute-force solver wins), at `Eff := ⊥` it is vacuous. The root cause (§8) is the adversary type:

    Adversary G := ∀ l, Inst l → Ans l

is a RAW FUNCTION carrying no cost, so no non-trivial `Eff` can even be *stated*. This is exactly the
EasyCrypt 2021 (eprint 2021/156) cost-model motivation — "an unbounded adversary's advantage is often 1,
so bounding resources is critical" — and FCF's (arXiv:1410.3735) reason for a `Comp` monad.

This module builds that cost model at the resolution EasyCrypt uses: **a cost VECTOR**, not a scalar.

  **§0 — COST IS A VECTOR: `⟨intr, qry⟩`.** EasyCrypt's judgement is `[intr : t_c, H.o : k_c]` — an
  *intrinsic* instruction count PLUS *per-abstract-procedure CALL COUNTS*. `Cost O` is exactly that:
  `intr : ℕ` (the adversary's OWN instructions) and `qry : O → ℕ` (how many times it calls each named
  oracle `o : O`). The old scalar is RECOVERED as a projection, `Cost.total = intr + ∑ o, qry o`, and
  more generally `Cost.billed oc = intr + ∑ o, qry o * oc o` prices the calls at whatever the oracle
  actually costs — `billed 1 = total`.

  ⚑ **THE ORACLE'S COST IS NOT THE ADVERSARY'S.** `cost` never mentions a price for answering a query:
  a `query` node contributes `⟨0, o ↦ 1⟩` — a CALL, no instructions. Who pays for running the oracle is
  the *environment's* business, and `billed_le_of_polyTime` is the theorem that composes the two: an
  adversary with poly `intr` and poly `qry`, against an oracle of per-call price `≤ B`, runs in poly
  total. `polyTime_iff_intr_and_queries` proves the vector is the object: `PolyTime` factors EXACTLY
  into "poly intrinsic work" ∧ "poly query counts" — and `queryHog` PROVES the two conjuncts are
  independent (an adversary with `l` instructions and `2^l` calls passes the first and fails the second),
  so the second component is load-bearing rather than decorative.

  **§1 — the cost-carrying adversary is a DEEP-EMBEDDED PROGRAM.** `FreeOracle O Q R α` is a small free
  monad / interaction tree over a FAMILY of oracles named by `O`, each with its own query type `Q o` and
  (finite) response type `R o`: `pure` (return), `tick` (one instruction), and `query o q k` (one call to
  oracle `o`, branching on the response).

  ⚑ **THE LOAD-BEARING CORRECTNESS RULE — cost is DERIVED FROM SYNTAX, never asserted.** `cost` is an
  instrumented interpreter of the PROGRAM: it counts `tick`s into `intr` and `query`s into `qry o`
  STRUCTURALLY. It is a function OF the program, not a field ON the structure. An asserted `cost := 0`
  field would re-admit brute force (the raw-function hole, one level up); here cost cannot be faked
  because the scan's `tick`s ARE in the syntax and `cost` sees all of them.

  ⚑ **AND THE ADVERSARY PAYS FOR WHAT IT WRITES.** `cost sz (.pure a) = ⟨sz a, 0⟩`: returning a value
  costs its SIZE under the game's encoding `sz`. This is what makes §3's overhead DERIVED rather than
  supplied — `maxOut_le_intr` then says *every value the program can return is no larger than its own
  intrinsic cost*, i.e. "a poly-time adversary writes poly-many bits" is a THEOREM here, not a wish.

  **SOUNDNESS OF THE WORST CASE.** Branching over responses is worst-cased (`Cost.supOver`), and
  `runCost_le_cost` PROVES that the vector upper-bounds the cost of every ACTUAL execution under every
  concrete oracle — component by component. `cost` can never undercount a run.

  **§2 — `PolyTime` and the two poles, PROVED.** `PolyTime sz A := ∃ C k, ∀ l i, (cost (sz l)
  (A.prog l i)).total ≤ C·lᵏ+C`. BOTH POLES are theorems at the tighter model:
    * `bruteForce_not_polyTime` (`Eff ≠ ⊤`): the enumeration adversary that scans a `2^l`-sized answer
      space has `cost.intr = 2^l + l`, super-polynomial — so the collapse witness of
      `hard_top_iff_solvableFrac_negl` is EXCLUDED at `Eff := PolyTime`. `bruteForce_solves` confirms it
      is a genuine solver (advantage `1` at `⊤`), so the exclusion is not vacuous.
    * `idAdv_polyTime` (`Eff ≠ ⊥`): the return adversary costs exactly the size of the answer it writes,
      so it is `PolyTime` whenever that answer is poly-size — and `idAdv_polyTime_expGame` exhibits the
      class INHABITED with NO hypothesis at all, at the very game the ⊤ pole uses.

  **§3 — `hclosed` (efficiency preservation) as a THEOREM, with the overhead DERIVED.**
  `cost_postMapProg_tight` is the EasyCrypt-shaped tight composition lemma

      cost (C[A]) ≤ cost A + δ,   δ = ⟨L.slope · (cost A).intr + L.base, L.qadd⟩

  with δ EXPLICIT — the reduction's own intrinsic cost (linear in the size of the value it is handed,
  which is bounded by `A`'s own cost) plus the calls IT adds, per oracle. `polyTime_postMapProg` then
  takes NO poly-overhead hypothesis: poly-ness of the overhead FOLLOWS from `PolyTime A` and the
  reduction's syntax. That is the honest successor to the old bare `hEff`, and to the earlier version of
  this module which took the overhead as a supplied `hov : PolyBoundedNat ov`.

  **§4 — CONNECTION to `FloorGames`.** `IsPolyTime sz : Adversary G → Prop` (a raw adversary is efficient
  iff SOME poly-time program denotes to it) makes `Hard G (IsPolyTime sz)` — e.g.
  `HashCRHardQuant F (IsPolyTime sz)` — a meaningful floor: `isPolyTime_inhabited` (non-vacuous),
  `bruteForce_not_polyTime` (proper restriction of ⊤). `isPolyTime_postMap` is the theorem the spine
  consumes to discharge `hEff` (`Market.WideCommitBoundary.stateCommit_binds_from_polyTime`), and it now
  asks for two NAT CONSTANTS (the reshaper's work, linear in input size) and a PROVED non-blow-up bound
  on the reshaper's output, instead of a floating `PolyBoundedNat ov`.

## ⚑ DESIGN COMMITMENTS THE LITERATURE DOES NOT SETTLE — stated, not silently taken.

1. **WORST-CASE, not expected.** Branching is `sup`-ed and the bound is `∀ l i`, so `PolyTime` is
   worst-case over instances and over oracle answers. Under an *expected*-PPT commitment (Feige, Goldreich–
   Levin's motivation) `sup` would become an average against the response distribution, `PolyTime` would
   be a strictly LARGER class, and `runCost_le_cost` would become "expectation ≤ bound" rather than a
   pointwise inequality. Nothing else in the module would change shape.
2. **UNIFORM, not non-uniform.** A `CostAdversary` is ONE program family `prog : ∀ l, Inst l → …`; there
   is no per-`l` advice string. Under a NON-uniform commitment the adversary would carry `advice : ∀ l,
   Advice l` with `size (advice l)` charged into `intr`, `PolyTime` would be a strictly larger class, and
   the ⊤-pole witness `bruteForce` would STILL be excluded (its work is `2^l` regardless of advice) while
   single-instance floors would collapse by hardcoding — the trap `CryptoFloorTeeth` §5 documents, which
   is why the λ-indexed instance space exists.
3. **DETERMINISTIC.** No coin tape; `gameAdv` is the counting probability over the instance space only.
   Randomised adversaries would add a `flip` node whose cost is `1` and whose branching is averaged, not
   `sup`-ed — i.e. commitment (1) again, one level down.
4. **THE SIZE MEASURE BELONGS TO THE GAME, NOT THE ADVERSARY.** `sz : ∀ l, G.Ans l → ℕ` is the encoding
   length of an answer. It is an argument of `PolyTime`, never a field of `CostAdversary`, precisely so
   an adversary cannot assert its own output is free — the same rule as cost. It is nevertheless a real
   modelling choice: a DEGENERATE `sz := 0` makes output free again and weakens §3's derivation back
   toward the supplied-overhead version. Consumers should instantiate it CONCRETELY (see
   `Market.WideCommitBoundary.stateAnsSize`/`wireAnsSize`/`hashAnsSize`), not leave it open.
5. **A REDUCTION'S OWN WORK IS DECLARED, because Lean functions have no runtime.** `isPolyTime_postMap`
   takes `cw bw : ℕ` — the reshaper costs `cw · (input size) + bw`. That number is not derivable from a
   Lean `fun`; what IS derived, and was not before, is (a) that the declared work is charged IN THE
   SYNTAX (`tickN`), (b) that it is LINEAR IN THE INPUT SIZE rather than a free polynomial in `l`, and
   (c) that the resulting overhead is poly — from `A`'s own bound, not from an assumption.

## Axiom hygiene

`#assert_all_clean` ⊆ {propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}; no `sorry`, no fresh `axiom`, no
`native_decide`. `Classical.choice` enters only via `bruteForce`'s solver (the same witness `FloorGames`
§2 uses) and the non-vacuity default answer.

/-! ## §3 — TIGHT COMPOSITION, and `hclosed` with the overhead DERIVED. -/

/-- **THE POST-PROCESSING WRAPPER at the cost level, as a PROGRAM.** The reduction `red` is itself a
`FreeOracle` program — so its cost is DERIVED from its syntax, not supplied as a number. The instance
families of the two games agree (`hI`, `rfl` at every use site of the spine). -/

/-- **⚑ THE TIGHT COMPOSITION LEMMA — `cost (C[A]) ≤ cost A + δ`, with `δ` EXPLICIT.**

Given a reduction whose own cost is linear in the size of the value it is handed (`L`), the composed
adversary costs at most the original PLUS

    δ = ⟨ L.slope · (cost A).intr + L.base , L.qadd ⟩

— the reduction's own intrinsic work (linear in `A`'s output size, which `maxOut_le_intr` bounds by
`A`'s own intrinsic cost) plus, PER ORACLE, exactly the calls the reduction adds. Not a blob: every
component of `δ` is a named quantity of the reduction. This is what lets reductions compose without
slack accumulating — chaining two reductions adds `δ₁ + δ₂`, and the query counts add per oracle. -/

/-- **⚑ `hclosed` — EFFICIENCY IS PRESERVED, AND THE OVERHEAD IS DERIVED.** If `A` is `PolyTime` and the
reduction's cost is linear in the size of the value it is handed, the composed adversary is `PolyTime`.

⚑ There is NO `hov : PolyBoundedNat ov` hypothesis. The overhead's poly-ness is a CONSEQUENCE: by
`maxOut_le_intr`, the value `A` hands the reduction is no bigger than `A`'s own cost bound, so the
reduction's linear-in-that-size work is bounded by `L.slope · P(l) + L.base` — and the added calls are
the fixed `L.qadd`. This is the honest successor to the earlier version of this lemma, which took the
overhead as an unconnected poly of `l`. -/

not all functions. (Oracle interface fixed to the trivial single oracle `(Unit, Unit, Unit)`; the spine

/-- **⚑ `IsPolyTime` IS CLOSED UNDER SIZE-LINEAR POST-COMPOSITION — the theorem the spine consumes to
discharge `hEff`.**

The reduction is a pure reshaping `f` that
  * costs `cw · (input size) + bw` instructions (DECLARED — design commitment 5: a Lean `fun` has no
    runtime; what is now structural is that the work is charged in the syntax and is LINEAR IN THE INPUT
    SIZE, not a free polynomial in `l`), and
  * does not BLOW UP its input: `sz' (f l i a) ≤ co · sz l a + bo` (a PROVED fact about the concrete
    reduction at every spine use site).

Then the reshaped adversary is `IsPolyTime`, with NO poly-overhead hypothesis: the overhead is derived
from `A`'s own bound via `maxOut_le_intr`.

⚑ The declared work is the one thing a caller could understate (`cw = bw = 0` claims a free reduction).
Even then the reduction is NOT free: `cost_reshape` charges `sz' (f l i a)` for the value it writes, so
the floor on a reduction's cost is the size of its own output, and `hout` is what bounds that. -/
