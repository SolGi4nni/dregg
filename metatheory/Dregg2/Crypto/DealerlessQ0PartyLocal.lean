# Party-local q0 contribution and transcript laws

This module is the Lean image of the experimental q0 commitment round in
`fhegg-fhe/src/threshold/quorum.rs`.  It separates three facts which are easy
to blur at the implementation boundary:

1. a finalized public view contains exactly one context- and slot-key-bound
   contribution at every position of the ordered custody roster;
2. each party can retain and check its own opening without any coordinator or
   dealer receiving the list of openings; and
3. an externally pinned, binding transcript anchor makes two different public
   contribution lists incompatible.

The last qualifier is load-bearing.  Recomputing a digest independently in
two split views merely gives two different, internally valid digests.  This
file does not invent authenticated broadcast, signatures, or consensus around
that digest.  Likewise, commitment injectivity is an explicit hypothesis; the
module does not claim concrete SIS binding or hiding parameters.

The exact q0 radix codec from `PqShareCommitment` is lifted to complete rows.
It is lossless for canonical q0 residues but is deliberately shown *not* to be
an additive homomorphism at a radix carry.  Consequently the current Rust
round correctly binds an ordered list of party/slot commitments; it must not
silently sum commitments made under different slot keys, nor identify a sum
of encoded limbs with the encoding of a modular BFV sum.
