# Dregg2.Crypto.Deriv.Powerset — Stage 4 narrow-residual close: the DEPLOYED determinized table
# specifically (not just "any agreeing table") agrees with `derives`.

`TableDfa.tableDfa_faithful` (the keystone) trusts ANY flat table whose `accepts` agrees with dregg's
derivative matcher `derives` on every word. It is CONSTRUCTION-agnostic — exactly because the deployed
AIR is table-opaque (design §3.2/§3.3). What it does NOT do, by itself, is discharge the agreement
hypothesis for the table a SPECIFIC compiler emits. This module closes that for the determinization
`dfa/src/{compiler,derivative}.rs` actually runs.

The deployed `Pattern::Not` / intersection path — the genuinely-new deny-filter capability of this
pillar (`75af4a99`) — compiles through `derivative.rs::Re::compile`, a LAZY DERIVATIVE
determinization: a worklist that assigns integer state IDs to canonicalized residual regexes, with
`step state byte = canonicalize(state.derive(byte))`, `accept = nullable`, `start = the regex`, dead
state `0 = ∅`. That construction's transition function IS the Brzozowski derivative (modulo a
language-preserving canonicalization done by the smart constructors), so its emitted table agrees with
`derives` BY CONSTRUCTION — no Thompson-NFA correctness, no subset-construction correctness needed.

This file models exactly that determinizer's CORRECTNESS CONTRACT and proves the consequence:

  * `LangEquiv` — the language equivalence `R ≈ S := ∀ w, derives w R = derives w S`. It is the right
    quotient for a determinizer: `null` and `der` are both `LangEquiv`-congruences (trivially, since
    `derives [] = null` and `derives w ∘ der a = derives (a :: w)`), and `≅`-similar regexes are
    `LangEquiv` (`sim_derives`) — so the deployed ACI/absorption canonicalization (the smart
    constructors) preserves it.
  * `DerivDeterminizer State R` — a flat `TableDfa` over `State` (the integer state IDs) PLUS a
    `decode : State → PredRE` recovering each state's residual, with the three contract conditions a
    derivative-determinizer maintains: the start state decodes to `R`, each transition decodes to the
    derivative of its source's residual, and acceptance is nullability of the residual — all UP TO
    `LangEquiv`, which is all that survives canonicalization.
  * `determinizer_faithful` — the close: under that contract the emitted table's `accepts` decides
    EXACTLY the denotational language `Matches R`. So the DEPLOYED table — integer states and all — is
    a concrete instance of `tableDfa_faithful`, not merely "some agreeing table."

Two witnesses pin non-vacuity over BOTH the residual-typed and the integer-ID (deployed) state spaces:
the identity-decode derivative automaton (for ANY `R`, incl. the deny-filter `neg (sym p)`), and a
concrete `State := Nat` table recognizing `ε`'s language — the integer-ID shape `Re::compile` emits.

The in-circuit `Dfa.lean` cascade is IMPORTED, untouched. `#assert_axioms`-clean, `sorry`-free.

What remains (NAMED, not closed): the LEGACY complement-free path `compiler.rs::pattern_to_nfa().
determinize()` (the Thompson-NFA subset construction) instantiates this same contract only via the
residual-language = Brzozowski-derivative bridge — i.e. Thompson-construction correctness composed with
subset-construction correctness. That bridge (design §3.2 step 3, the months-scale automata theory) is
the one piece still open; the deny-filter path this module closes does not need it.

/-! ## `LangEquiv` — language equivalence, the determinizer's state quotient. -/

/-- **`LangEquiv R S`** — `R` and `S` recognize the same language, witnessed executably: they give
the same `derives` verdict on every word. This is the equivalence a determinizer collapses its states
by; it is coarser than syntactic equality and coarser than `≅`-similarity (every `≅`-similar pair is
`LangEquiv`, `sim_langEquiv`). It is automatically a `der`/`null`-congruence (`langEquiv_null`,
`langEquiv_der`), so threading a run through `LangEquiv`-collapsed states never changes the verdict. -/

/-- `null` is a `LangEquiv`-congruence: language-equivalent regexes are equi-nullable (the `w = []`
instance, since `derives [] R = null R`). -/
theorem langEquiv_null {R S : PredRE} (h : LangEquiv R S) : null R = null S := h []

/-- `der a` is a `LangEquiv`-congruence: the derivative of language-equivalent regexes is
language-equivalent (`derives w (der a R) = derives (a :: w) R`). This is what lets a determinizer
canonicalize residuals between steps without changing the recognized language. -/
theorem langEquiv_der {R S : PredRE} (h : LangEquiv R S) (a : Value) :
    LangEquiv (der a R) (der a S) := fun w => h (a :: w)

/-- Every `≅`-similar pair is `LangEquiv` (via Stage 3 `sim_derives`). So the deployed compiler's
ACI / `∅`-absorption / double-negation canonicalization (the `derivative.rs` smart constructors, all
`≅`-preserving) keeps a state's residual `LangEquiv` to its un-normalized derivative — exactly the
`step_spec` a `DerivDeterminizer` requires. -/

/-! ## `DerivDeterminizer` — the correctness contract of a derivative-based determinization. -/

/-- **`DerivDeterminizer State R`** — a flat `TableDfa` over a state space `State` (in the deployed
compiler, `State = Nat`: the integer state IDs into the `order` vector), together with a `decode`
recovering each state's residual regex, satisfying the three invariants a derivative determinizer
maintains while building `R`'s table:

* `start_spec`  — the start state decodes (up to `LangEquiv`) to `R` itself;
* `step_spec`   — every transition `step s a` decodes to the derivative `der a (decode s)` (up to
                  `LangEquiv`; the deployed `step` is `canonicalize ∘ der`, and canonicalization is
                  `≅` hence `LangEquiv`);
* `accept_spec` — a state accepts iff its residual is nullable.

This is precisely the contract `derivative.rs::Re::compile` satisfies by construction (its states ARE
canonicalized residuals, its `step` IS `derive`, its `accepting` IS `nullable`). -/

/-! ### A concrete INTEGER-ID table — the shape `Re::compile` actually emits.

States are `Nat` IDs (`0 = dead/∅`, the start state, …) with a `decode` back to residuals — the
deployed layout. We model the 2-state table for `ε`'s language: `decode 0 = ε` (start, accepting),
every other ID decodes to `∅` (the dead state, self-looping). This is the integer-ID determinized form
the keystone now covers concretely. -/
