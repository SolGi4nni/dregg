# Dregg2.Crypto.DfaAcceptanceAir — the REAL `dregg-dfa-routing-v1` STARK AIR, modeled.

`Dregg2.Crypto.Dfa` models a GENERIC DFA-acceptance bridge over an arbitrary transition *relation*
`δ`, and its header asserts "NO `compress`/hash anywhere — pure structural matching". That is
faithful to the simple RETIRED `dfa_lookup_descriptor` DSL test builder (deleted with the hand-STARK engine, 2026-07-16; deployed anchor is `dfa-routing-toggle-2state::poseidon2-v1` via descriptor_by_name, emitted by `DfaRoutingEmit.lean`) (one `Lookup`
constraint), but it is NOT the AIR that underwrites the deliverable

    "this input was correctly classified by DFA D (commitment C) to state S".

That sentence is discharged by the standalone STARK `dregg-dfa-routing-v1`
(`tests/src/dfa_circuit.rs`, the real `stark::prove`/`stark::verify` path). That AIR is hash-HEAVY,
and its soundness pivots ENTIRELY on a Poseidon2 running-hash that binds the whole transition trace
to two public commitments. This module models THAT AIR — the two gaps the generic bridge leaves:

  GAP-A  δ is a deterministic TABLE LOOKUP `next == transitions[state*256+byte]` — a *function*, not
         an arbitrary relation. "classified to state S" is only well-defined because the run is the
         UNIQUE run of D on the input. We model `δ` as `step : State → Sym → State`.

  GAP-B  the AIR's real constraints (`DfaRoutingAir::eval_constraints` / `boundary_constraints`):
           C1  entryHashᵢ   = compressN [state_i, sym_i, next_i, 0]            (`hash_4_to_1`)
           C2  state_{i+1}  = next_i                                           (continuity)
           C3  running₀     = compress tableCommitment entryHash₀             (seed)
               running_{i+1}= compress running_i entryHash_{i+1}              (`hash_2_to_1`)
           B1  state₀       = initialState                                    (public input)
           B2  next_last    = finalState  =: S                               (public input)
           B3  running_last = routeCommitment =: C                           (public input)
         The running hash `routeCommitment` is a rolling commitment over `[tableCommitment,
         entryHash₀, entryHash₁, …]`. THIS ties the trace to the table commitment C_table and the
         claimed final state S — and `Crypto.Dfa` omits it entirely.

## What is proven

  * `air_run_is_table_run` / `air_final_state_is_classification` — an AIR-satisfying trace IS the
    deterministic run of the table DFA on its symbol sequence; its public `finalState` S equals the
    genuine classification `classify d input`. SOUND "classified to S". (No crypto.)

  * `route_commitment_binds_trace` — given the Poseidon2 collision-resistance carrier
    (`CollisionFree`), two AIR-satisfying traces with the SAME `tableCommitment` and the SAME public
    `routeCommitment` C have IDENTICAL entry-hash chains, hence (by `compressN`-CR) identical
    `(state, sym, next)` triples — the SAME run. The commitment C BINDS the classified trace. THIS
    is the soundness pivot `Crypto.Dfa` could not state (it had no hash). CR is CONSUMED as a named
    carrier, NEVER a Lean equation on the uninterpreted `compress`.

  * `dfaAir_verify_sound` — the §8 cascade: `verify accepts → ∃ run, S = classify d input`. Derived
    off STARK `extractable` (FRI/Fiat-Shamir); `extractable` is the single trust boundary.

## Non-vacuity (`Reference`)

The EXACT `dregg-dfa-routing-v1` 4-state router (`dfa_circuit.rs:56`). An ACCEPTING input
`[internal, external, internal]` → `LOCAL`; a REJECTING input `[unknown,…]` → `REJECT ≠ LOCAL`, so
PROVABLY not accepted (`reject_input_not_accepted`). A genuine `CollisionFree` instance (an injective
`Encodable` pairing) FIRES the binding on a concrete chain (`commitment_binds_concrete`); a COLLIDING
compression FALSIFIES the carrier (`badPrimitives_not_collisionFree`) — the carrier is not `True`.

/-! ## §1 — The table DFA (`δ` as a FUNCTION — GAP-A).

The real AIR enforces `next_state == transitions[state*256 + byte]` (`air.rs:57-63`,
`dfa_circuit.rs:259`): given `(state, byte)` the next state is a determined table cell. We model the
transition table as a total function `step : State → Sym → State`; its graph
`fun s y n => step s y = n` is the (automatically deterministic) relation the generic `Crypto.Dfa`
left open. The run threads `step` from a start state; `classify` returns the state reached. -/

variable {State Sym : Type u}

/-- A **table DFA**: a total transition function `step` (the flat `transitions` table read as a
function of `(state, byte)`), a `start` state, and an `accepts` predicate on the reached state
(membership in the `accepting` set, `dfa_circuit.rs:60`). Function-ness IS the determinism the

/-! ## §2 — The AIR trace and its constraints (GAP-B: the hash chain).

A trace ROW mirrors `dfa_circuit.rs:94` `(current_state, symbol, next_state, table_entry_hash,
running_hash)` — the two `Digest` columns are the heart of the AIR. The `step` counter column
(`air.rs:15`) is positional and omitted. `Digest` is the `CryptoPrimitives` carrier; `compress` =
`hash_2_to_1`, `compressN` = `hash_4_to_1`. -/

  running : Digest

/-- The 4-arity entry hash of a `(state, sym, next)` triple as the AIR computes it (constraint C1,
`dfa_circuit.rs:172`: `hash_4_to_1([encState s, encSym y, encState n, 0])`). The field-encodings
`encState`/`encSym` are the `BabyBear::new(..)` injections of state-ids / bytes; `0 : Digest` is the
padding lane. -/

  | a :: b :: rest => b.state = a.next ∧ Continuous (b :: rest)

/-- **`Satisfies`** — the row list satisfies the `dregg-dfa-routing-v1` AIR for table DFA `d`,
encodings `enc*`, seed `tableCommitment`, and public inputs `(initialState, finalState,
routeCommitment)`. Conjuncts in AIR order: C1 (entry hash), TABLE lookup (`next = step state sym`),

holds — the binding FIRES). `Digest := ℤ`, `compress a b := encode (a,b)`, `compressN l := encode l`
(via `Encodable.encode : _ → ℕ`, then `ℕ ↪ ℤ`). `commit` is the trivial `0` (its only law,
`commit_hom`, is `0 = 0+0`); the hardness carriers are `True` for the reference. -/

Without a positive witness, `air_final_state_is_classification` / `dfaAir_verify_sound` could be
vacuously safe. We build a CONCRETE 2-row accepting trace over the router DFA reading
`[internal, external] = [0,1]` (`IDLE →0 LOCAL →1 REMOTE`), with the real Poseidon2-shaped hash
chain (reference primitives), and prove it `Satisfies` AND that the soundness conclusion fires:
`finalState = REMOTE = classify routerDfa [0,1]`. So the hypothesis is achievable and the conclusion
is the genuine classification — the "true" half of non-vacuity (the reject is the "false" half). -/
