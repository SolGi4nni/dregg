# `Dregg2.Crypto.EncodedBindingReduction` — the REUSABLE reduction spine for every
`digest binds the object` claim in the deployed circuit tree.

## The sin this retires, once, generically

The tree is full of keystones of the shape

    theorem foo_binds_or_collides … (h : dig x = dig x') : x = x' ∨ FooColl dig x x'

`FooColl` is a predicate about the pair a TOTAL extractor returns, so — unlike an `∃ collision` — it is
not unconditionally true by pigeonhole *at a fixed pair*.  But the DISJUNCTION still quantifies over
SOLUTIONS: at deployed BabyBear parameters a collision of the underlying sponge/chip EXISTS
(`VacuitySweepTeeth`), so nothing in the statement prevents an adversary from living in the right
branch forever.  `binds ∨ collides` NAMES the floor; it does not STAND on it.  Cryptographic hardness
quantifies over EFFICIENT ADVERSARIES, and that is the object this module supplies.

## What is generic here, and why that is the whole point

Every one of those keystones has the SAME anatomy:

  * a deployed keyed primitive `F : KeyedHashFamily` (the sponge `List ℤ → ℤ`, the arity-16 chip
    `List ℤ → Digest8`, the wide permutation `List ℤ → List ℤ`, the 4-to-1 compress `ℤ⁴ → ℤ`),
  * a DOMAIN `α` the circuit claims the digest binds (a `system_roots` sub-block, a cap leaf, a heap
    path, a transfer descriptor, a whole post-state, …),
  * an ENCODER `enc : ∀ l, F.Key l → α → F.Input` — the ordered limb list the deployed prover absorbs,
  * and the claim "equal `F.H ∘ enc` ⟹ equal `enc`".

So the reduction is the SAME reduction every time: the forgery is a `Game` whose win relation is
"two domain points with DISTINCT encodings and EQUAL images"; the extractor is `enc` applied to both
answers — a map of adversaries into `hashGame F`; win-preservation is definitional; the advantage
inequality is `winProb_le_of_imp` over the SAME sampled key space; the security conclusion is
domination under `HashCRHardQuant F Eff`.  Writing that ~60 times by hand is how the per-site copies
drift.  It is written ONCE here, and each site supplies only

  1. its encoder and the definitional fact that its deployed digest IS `F.H ∘ enc`,
  2. the STRUCTURAL injectivity of its encoder (`a ≠ a' → enc a ≠ enc a'`) — a real theorem about the
     limb layout, never about the hash,
  3. the output-size fact `hout` (the `poly_time` slot).

Everything else — the game, the extractor, the inequality, the negligibility, the efficiency
discharge, both poles, the canary — is inherited.

## The efficiency parameter is DISCHARGED, not carried

`encBinding_advantage_bound` is the statement at an ARBITRARY adversary class `Eff` (with the honest
`hEff` obligation in the open).  `encBinding_from_polyTime` instantiates `Eff` at
`CostAdversary.IsPolyTime` — a cost-vector model whose cost is derived from a deep-embedded program's
SYNTAX — and DERIVES `hEff` with `CostTactics.poly_time`, leaving `hout` as the only per-site input.
The ⊤-collapse witness (`CostAdversary.bruteForce`) is PROVED excluded from that class and the class is
PROVED inhabited, so the instantiated floor sits strictly between the two poles proved in §4.

## ⚑ The `_from_polyTime` discharges are DELETED; §7 is the DISCHARGED successor (07-24)

`Exec.SystemRootsBindingReduction.sysRoots_floor_polyTime_false_babyBear` refutes the
`IsPolyTime`-instantiated floor at the deployed sponge, and `Crypto.RomBindingReduction`'s header
proves no `Eff` repairs the fixed-function game.  `encBinding_from_polyTime` /
`encBinding_from_polyTime_fixedWidth` therefore discharged onto a hypothesis that is FALSE at
deployed parameters — they are DELETED, and §7 lands the successor in-file on the PROVED keyed-ROM
floor: the forger is an ORACLE PROGRAM over the sampled key-separated oracle, the site's
key-dependent encoder becomes a `RomCarrierSites.keyedEncCarrier`, and `encBinding_rom` concludes
`Negl` from `KeyedRomFloor.keyedRom_hard` (the birthday bound — a THEOREM) via `flatSite_binds`,
with nothing refutable carried.  The chained shape's successor is `RomCarrierSites.chained_rom_binds`.
The `_advantage_bound` forms here stay the honest fixed-hash statements with `hEff` in the open.

## Bars

No `sorry`, no `axiom`, no `native_decide`, no `decide` on an opaque `Prop`.  Cost stays SYNTACTIC.

/-! ## §1 — the ENCODED-DOMAIN BREAK GAME: the forgery, as a first-class `Game`.

The adversary is handed a uniformly sampled key (at every deployed site: the domain-separation tag the
prover absorbs) and WINS iff it outputs two points of the bound domain whose deployed ENCODINGS DIFFER
yet whose deployed DIGESTS agree.  That is exactly the forgery the `_binds_or_collides` disjunction
declined to price: the prover publishing one digest and opening it two ways.

The encoding inequality is the honest side condition, not a weakening — a "forgery" whose encodings
AGREE is not a break of this primitive at all (the two domain points are the same absorbed message;
any residual disagreement lives in a SEPARATELY-priced layer, e.g. a lower digest that fed a limb). -/

/-- **THE FORGERY GAME.** `α` is the domain the deployed digest claims to bind; `enc` is the ordered
limb list the prover absorbs.  A win is a genuine equivocation of `F` at the sampled key. -/

/-- **THE STRUCTURAL BRIDGE.** When the encoder is injective — a real theorem about the deployed LIMB

/-! ## §2 — the EXTRACTOR, as a map of adversaries, and the advantage inequality. -/

/-- **THE EXTRACTOR.** A digest forger becomes a collision finder for the deployed primitive by

`Classical.choose` of an existential, which is what makes the result an advantage bound rather than a
restatement of pigeonhole. -/

finder wins the collision game of the REAL primitive: the two encodings are distinct (the forgery's own
side condition) with equal images (the equal published digest).  Definitional: the games agree on the
nose, which is the honest reading of "this reduction adds nothing but the encoding". -/

/-- **⚑ THE HEADLINE BINDING, AS A SECURITY REDUCTION.**

Under the DEPLOYED primitive's collision floor at the class `Eff`, a digest forger whose extracted
finder is in that class has NEGLIGIBLE advantage: the deployed digest binds its whole encoded domain
EXCEPT with negligible probability.  This is what replaces `binds ∨ collides` as the exported claim —
it quantifies over EFFICIENT ADVERSARIES, where the disjunction quantified over SOLUTIONS.

`hEff` is the standard "the reduction is efficient", left in the open at an arbitrary class; §3
discharges it at `Eff := IsPolyTime` and §4 prices both poles. -/

/-- **⚑ THE ⊤ POLE — the floor is FALSE at the unrestricted class, for any COMPRESSING primitive.**
The honest price of `hEff`, as a theorem rather than a promise: the `Classical.choice` finder that
outputs a collision at every key wins with probability `1`, and pigeonhole supplies one at deployed
BabyBear parameters.  What the reduction buys is NOT a floor the deployed hash satisfies at ⊤ — no such
floor exists — it is that the residual is ONE named parameter with both poles proved, in place of a
disjunction whose right branch is unconditionally available.

⚑ The `⊤` is WRITTEN OUT in the statement. It used to be reachable through
`HashFloorHonesty.CollisionResistant`, which was a spelling of this very proposition; that name is
DELETED (2026-07-28) and this now applies `FloorGames.hashCRHardQuant_top_false_of_compressing`

/-! ## §6 — CHAINED bindings: the union bound, once, for every `root ⟸ node ⟸ leaf` site.

Almost every deployed keystone is a CHAIN: a commitment absorbs a digest which absorbs a sub-block; a
Merkle root folds a node which folds a leaf.  Their `_or_collides` forms show it as a THREE-way bare
disjunction (`equal ∨ CommitColl ∨ InnerColl`), which is exactly where the shirk compounds — two escape
branches instead of one.

The honest form is the standard UNION BOUND: the composed forger's advantage is at most the SUM of the
two extracted finders' advantages, and a sum of negligibles is negligible.  Stated once here, over a
forgery game that shares the primitive's key space (which every deployed site does — one sampled
domain-separation tag runs the whole chain). -/

⚑ **THE MODELLING STEP, STATED (not smuggled).** The deployed keyed primitive is idealised as ONE
SAMPLED oracle `H : Key × Msg → Fin (2 ^ l)` over the site's (finite, truncated-deployed-shape)
absorbed message space — the standard ROM idealisation at an ASYMPTOTIC digest width, a deliberate
labelled modelling step, NOT a derivation about the fixed public function.  The site's key-dependent
encoder `emb` and its STRUCTURAL payload-injectivity — the same two facts §1 takes — become a
`RomCarrierSites.keyedEncCarrier`; the adversary chooses which key to attack (the key is its
CONTEXT), and what it cannot choose is the sampled oracle. -/

/-- **⚑⚑ THE RE-GROUNDED ENCODED-DOMAIN BINDING — floor PROVED, nothing refutable carried.** Every
query-bounded digest forger has NEGLIGIBLE advantage: the deployed digest binds its whole encoded
domain except with negligible probability, in the keyed ROM model of the header.  The hypotheses are
a polynomial query budget and the forger's membership in the query class.  This is what
`encBinding_from_polyTime(_fixedWidth)` (DELETED — floor refuted) claimed and could not have; the
fixed-width side condition dissolved into the finiteness of `Msg`. -/
