# `Dregg2.Crypto.FactoryBindingFloorRegrounded` — the `Compress1CR` / factory-`HashInjective` /
`BindingHashCR` injective floors, swept: proved FALSE (or PRECISELY not-false) at deployed parameters,
and their consumers RE-GROUNDED onto REAL collision-game reductions carrying an explicit `Eff`.

## The bug this closes (`VACUITY-SWEEP.md` FINDING 2, cluster 2 — the factory/binding half)

`HashFloorHonesty` proved four injectivity floors FALSE and doc-marked them BROKEN; FINDING 2 found ~20
more with the identical shape, still doc-marked "REALIZABLE", **none re-grounded**. Three are here:

  * `Crypto.CommitmentBinding.Compress1CR c1 := ∀ a b : List ℤ, c1 a = c1 b → a = b` (`:52`)
  * `Exec.Factory.HashInjective := ∀ s₁ s₂ p₁ p₂, factoryHash s₁ p₁ = factoryHash s₂ p₂ → s₁=s₂ ∧ p₁=p₂` (`:75`)
  * `Authority.MacaroonDischarge.BindingHashCR bh := ∀ a b : Tag, bh a = bh b → a = b` (`:171`)

The commit-state siblings (`cellLeafInjective`/`logHashInjective`) are `Circuit.StateCommitFloorRegrounded`.

## ⚑ `Compress2` is NON-INHABITABLE at deployed parameters — the priority shape, again

`Compress1CR` is not merely a hypothesis on a theorem: it is a **FIELD** of the `Compress2` structure
(`compress1CR`). §1's `compress2_uninhabitable_babyBear` proves a deployed `Compress2` **value cannot
exist** — `List ℤ` is infinite, a BabyBear squeeze is one bounded field element, pigeonhole. This is the
`Compress8CR`-in-`Cap8Scheme` shape the sweep named the priority. Consequence, and it is the load-bearing
one: `CommitmentBinding.compressInjective_of_compress2` is the route that discharges
`StateCommit.recStateCommit_binds`'s `compressInjective cmb` portal — the sweep's own header advertises it
as *"the `StateCommit` root-binding portal thereby stands on the permutation CR, NOT a separate
assumption"*. At BabyBear that route stands on nothing: its premise is uninhabitable, and only
`Reference.refCompress2` (whose `compress1` is `Encodable.encode`, injective into ALL of `ℤ`) satisfies
it. Toy witness satisfiable; real instantiation false — verbatim the FALSE COMFORT `HashFloorHonesty`'s
own header named.

## ⚑ `BindingHashCR` is the ONE carrier in this cluster that is NOT false by pigeonhole — and that
   matters more than a fifth refutation would

The sweep lists all ~20 as one class ("FALSE-AS-NAMED at deployed parameters"). **That is not uniform, and
§4 proves the exception rather than assuming it.** `bindingHash : Tag → Bytes` is `crypto::binding_hash` =
SHA-256 of a 32-byte macaroon tail into a 32-byte caveat body: the domain is NOT larger than the range, so
the counting core **does not bite**, and injectivity is *consistent* (a permutation of a 32-byte set is
injective). §4 therefore proves the conditional teeth honestly — FALSE exactly when `bindingHash`
compresses (`bindingHashCR_false_of_compressing`, `bindingHashCR_false_of_infinite_tag`) — and NOT a
deployed refutation, because there is none to prove and manufacturing one would be the disease.

The defect at `BindingHashCR` is the OTHER one, and it is still real: injectivity is an
adversary-independent statement about EXISTENCE, while what `binding_not_replayable_to_other_root` and
`rebinding_changes_replay` actually need is that an attacker cannot FIND a colliding tail. And the Lean
carrier quantifies over a GENERIC `Tag`: at any instantiation where the tail type is unbounded — which is
how this model treats tags, `MacKernel.mac` mapping unbounded `Bytes` into `Tag` with nothing bounding it
— `bindingHashCR_false_of_infinite_tag` makes it FALSE. So it is re-grounded on the same terms as the
others (§4), with its verdict stated precisely instead of rounded up.

## The re-grounding does NOT go through `CollisionResistant`

`FloorGames.collisionResistant_false_of_compressing`: `HashFloorHonesty.CollisionResistant F` is ITSELF
false at deployed parameters (it IS `HashCRHardQuant F ⊤`, and the `Classical.choice` finder wins with
probability `1`). At the unrestricted class every floor is false-at-deployed or vacuous, and
`hard_top_iff_solvableFrac_negl` is an `↔` — no restatement of the win relation escapes. **The only honest
escape is the `Eff` parameter** (`FloorGames` §8). Every keystone below takes it, and carries the
`Eff`-membership obligation for the finder its reduction builds, in the open, at the use site.

## The reductions (each with a canary that REDS if the reduction is deleted)

  * **§2 `nodeToCompress1Adv`** — a collision of the 2-to-1 node hash `h` becomes a collision of the
    single-permutation-call `compress1`, by the INJECTIVE packing: `pack₂ a b ≠ pack₂ c d` (contraposed
    `pack₂_inj`) while `compress1 (pack₂ a b) = h a b = h c d = compress1 (pack₂ c d)` (`factor`). This is
    `compressInjective_of_compress2`, contraposed into an extractor.
  * **§3 `forgerToFactoryHashAdv`** — a factory forger outputs two WELL-FORMED descriptors with equal
    `vk` and different content; well-formedness converts the `vk` equality into a hash equality, so the
    two contents are a genuine collision of `factoryHash`. This is `vk_determines_invariants`, contraposed.
  * **§4 `rebinderToBindingAdv`** — a re-binder outputs one discharge and two DISTINCT parent tails with
    the SAME replay; `hmacInj` peels the final MAC step, leaving `bindingHash p = bindingHash p'` — a
    genuine binding-hash collision. This is `rebinding_changes_replay`, contraposed.

## Non-fake

Both poles PROVED for every derived floor (`Eff := ⊤` FALSE at compressing parameters, `Eff := ⊥`
vacuous). Old injective-floor consumers KEPT untouched; siblings ADDED. `#assert_all_clean`; no `sorry`,
no fresh `axiom`.

/-! ### §1c — ⚑ `BindingHashCR`: the conditional teeth, and the HONEST non-verdict.

Unlike every other carrier in this cluster, `BindingHashCR` is **NOT refuted at deployed parameters**, and
the sweep's blanket "FALSE-AS-NAMED at deployed parameters" is wrong about it. `crypto::binding_hash` is
SHA-256 of a 32-byte macaroon tail producing a 32-byte caveat body: `|Tag| = |Bytes| = 2²⁵⁶`, the map does
NOT compress, and pigeonhole has nothing to say. Injectivity there is *consistent* — unprovable and
unfalsifiable, but not false.

So the teeth below are stated at their REAL scope: the carrier is false exactly when the binding hash
compresses, or when the tail type is unbounded (which is how this model treats `Tag` — nothing in
`MacaroonDischarge` bounds it, and `MacKernel.mac` maps unbounded `Bytes` into it). Proving a refutation
here would require manufacturing a hypothesis the deployment does not satisfy; the discipline is to say so.
The defect that IS present — injectivity is adversary-independent EXISTENCE where the consumer needs
computational FINDING — is what §4 repairs. -/

/-- **TOOTH — `BindingHashCR` is FALSE exactly when the binding hash COMPRESSES.** If the tail space is
larger than the caveat-body space, pigeonhole pins two distinct tails to one binding body. ⚑ At the
DEPLOYED SHA-256 instantiation (32-byte tail → 32-byte body) this hypothesis is NOT satisfied, so this
tooth does not fire there — recorded honestly rather than rounded up to a refutation. -/

  exact fun hCR => hne (hCR a b heq)

/-- **TOOTH — `BindingHashCR` is FALSE for an UNBOUNDED tail type with a fixed-width body.** This IS the
Lean model's own situation: `MacaroonDischarge` quantifies over a GENERIC `Tag` with nothing bounding it,
and `MacKernel.mac : Key → Bytes → Tag` produces tags from unbounded messages. At any such instantiation
with a finite-range binding hash the carrier is false — so the generic consumers
(`binding_body_distinguishes_roots`, `rebinding_changes_replay`) are vacuous there, even though the
32-byte-tail reading escapes. -/

/-! ## §2 — `Compress1CR` RE-GROUNDED: the node-hash collision REDUCES to a `compress1` collision.

`CommitmentBinding.compressInjective_of_compress2` proves `compressInjective h` from a `Compress2 h` by
peeling the one-permutation-call CR then the injective packing. CONTRAPOSED, that peel is an EXTRACTOR:
a collision of the 2-to-1 node hash IS a collision of the single permutation call. -/

/-- **THE 2-TO-1 REALIZATION FAMILY.** At each parameter `l` a finite sampled instance space, and per
instance the deployed `Compress2` data: the node hash `h`, the single-permutation compression `compress1`,
the rate-block packing `pack₂`, its STRUCTURAL injectivity, and the factorization `h = compress1 ∘ pack₂`.
Everything except the crypto carrier — which is exactly the point: `Compress1CR` is GONE from the bundle
(that is what made `Compress2` uninhabitable, §1a), and the collision floor enters at the use site. -/

HARDNESS of the content hash, VIA the reduction.**

Under the collision floor at the `factoryHash` family, at a NAMED `Eff` class, a factory forger has
NEGLIGIBLE advantage: the published `vk` determines the cell's whole field layout and lifetime invariant
set EXCEPT with negligible probability. Constructor transparency — *"anyone with the `factory_vk` knows
exactly what invariants the cell will carry"* — survives the loss of the FALSE `HashInjective` (§1b) as an
honest concrete-security statement about BLAKE3, which is what `Factory.lean`'s own §8 note always said it
was (*"collision-resistance of BLAKE3, discharged by the hash circuit"*) — it just carried injectivity
instead.

⚑ `hEff` is UNDISCHARGED and that is the honest state (`FloorGames` §8). -/

/-! ## §4 — the macaroon `BindingHashCR` RE-GROUNDED (existence → finding).

`MacaroonDischarge.rebinding_changes_replay` says: re-binding a discharge to a DIFFERENT parent changes
its replay tail, so you cannot silently swap the bound parent and keep the stored tail. It consumes
`BindingHashCR` (via `binding_body_distinguishes_roots`) plus the local `hmacInj` premise. Its BREAK is a
RE-BINDER: one discharge, two DISTINCT parent tails, ONE replay. `hmacInj` peels the final MAC step off
that break, leaving a genuine binding-hash collision — that peel is the reduction.

⚑ Per §1c this is the carrier that is NOT refuted at deployed parameters. The re-grounding still earns its
keep: it moves the consumer from adversary-independent EXISTENCE (which SHA-256-on-32-bytes may well
satisfy, unprovably) to computational FINDING (which is what "collision-resistance" has always meant, and
what `MacaroonDischarge`'s own §PORTAL note claims it is carrying). -/

/-- **THE MACAROON BINDING FAMILY.** At each parameter a finite sampled instance space, the tail/body
types, their decidable equality, the `MacKernel` the discharge chain runs on, and per instance the

from COLLISION HARDNESS of the binding hash, VIA the reduction.**

Under the collision floor at the binding-hash family, at a NAMED `Eff` class, a re-binder has NEGLIGIBLE
advantage: a discharge issued for a heavily-attenuated root cannot be re-pointed at a less-attenuated one,
EXCEPT with negligible probability. This is the property that defeats "strip caveats off the root, reuse
the old discharge" (`macaroon.rs:324-329`), now stated as something an attacker must FIND rather than as
injectivity of SHA-256.

the companion refutation that would make this "strictly stronger AND empty" is NOT available at deployed
parameters here. So this bridge says only that the old carrier was strictly stronger than needed; whether
it was EMPTY depends on an instantiation the model never pins. -/
