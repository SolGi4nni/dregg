# Dregg2.Crypto.GraphRewriteHistory — root-linked receipts for semantic rewrite histories.

`Crypto.GraphRewrite` proves the semantic step relation: a licensed rule genuinely matches a host
graph, deletes its instantiated left-hand side, preserves a context, and glues its instantiated
right-hand side.  `Crypto.Chain` proves that a locally checkable `Cert R` chain is equivalent to the
reflexive-transitive closure of any relation `R`.

This file supplies the protocol bridge between those two facts and a public receipt stream.  A
`CertifiedStep` has a public statement `(session, rulesRoot, index, oldRoot, newRoot)` plus hidden
semantic openings `(oldGraph, newGraph)` and a sound `RewriteStep`.  Consecutive receipts must keep
the same session/rules root, increment the index exactly once, and connect `newRoot` to `oldRoot`.

The commitment boundary is deliberately not faked.  Equal graph roots imply equal semantic graphs
only under a supplied binding carrier (`Function.Injective commit` here, the idealized theorem shape
which a deployed hash instantiates computationally).  Without it, a root-linked semantic splice
extracts an explicit collision: two different graphs with the same commitment
(`hidden_splice_extracts_collision` — the extraction tooth, which NAMES the pair).  Under binding,
`linked_reduces` and `linked_has_cert` turn any nonempty receipt history into a genuine
`ReflTransGen (RewriteStep rules)` / `Hypergraph.Cert` from its first graph to its last.

## ⚑ The history soundness is now SPLIT: a pure core + a keyed-ROM reduction (07-24)

The former exports `linked_reduces_or_collision` / `linked_has_cert_or_collision` concluded
`… ∨ CommitCollision commit` with `CommitCollision = ∃ g h, g ≠ h ∧ commit g = commit h` — at any
deployed compressing root that existential is TRUE by pigeonhole, so both disjunctions held
through the collides branch with the semantic conclusion never forced.  A statement about
SOLUTIONS, where hardness quantifies over EFFICIENT ADVERSARIES.  DELETED (with the
`CommitCollision` shape itself), replaced by the honest split:

  * **the PURE core** — `reduces_of_adjacent_agree` / `has_cert_of_adjacent_agree`: a receipt
    history whose adjacent hidden endpoint graphs AGREE composes to a genuine reduction, with no
    hash anywhere; `adjacent_agree_of_linked_of_injective` recovers the agreement from root links
    under the idealized carrier (so `linked_reduces` is the composition of the two, unchanged);
  * **the PRICED escape** — §RomSuccessor: the ONLY way a linked history can fail the agreement is
    a SPLICE, and at the sampled keyed oracle the splice forger is a first-class `RomForgery`
    whose extractor is a pure post-map (`mapOut`, budget preserved) into the commitment carrier;
    `historySplice_binds_rom` closes it from the PROVED birthday floor (`keyedRom_hard` via
    `romCarrier_binds`).  ⚑ The modelling step is labelled (`RomCarrierSites` header): the sampled
    `H : Unit × Val → Fin (2 ^ l)` idealises the deployed graph root over a BOUNDED graph payload
    at asymptotic width; nothing is claimed about the fixed public hash.

This is independent of any particular AIR.  A bounded private graph-rewrite descriptor discharges
each receipt's `sound` field; the existing IVC segment chain carries the public roots.  The theorem
then supplies the semantic meaning of the folded history.

/-! ## ⚑ §RomSuccessor — the SPLICE, PRICED on the PROVED keyed-ROM floor.

The pure core needs `AdjacentAgree`; the receipt discipline supplies root LINKS.  The only gap is
a SPLICE: a linked history in which some adjacent pair hides two DIFFERENT graphs behind one
root.  The deleted disjunctions let that gap escape through `∃ collision` (unconditionally true
at a compressing root).  Here the splice is a first-class forgery at the SAMPLED oracle: the
forger outputs a whole receipt history, the win relation checks the links, the bindings against
the sampled oracle, and the presence of a splice — and the extractor hands the spliced pair to
the commitment carrier as a pure post-map.  `keyedRom_hard` (the birthday bound) kills it. -/
