# Dregg2.Crypto.HandlebarsGuardDecision — the DEPLOYED templater guard, run through the committed
decidable-predicate tower.

`Crypto/HandlebarsGuarded.lean` demoted the templater's hardcoded brace-ban to ONE guard among many:
a hole carries a `PredRE` over `Dregg2.Exec.Value`, and `noDoubleBraceRE = neg (any* ⬝ {{ ⬝ any*)` is
the particular guard the committed `Handlebars` family uses at EVERY hole
(`noDoubleBraceRE_iff` / `guardedSafe_noDoubleBrace_iff`). `guardedToGrammar` composes those guards
as REGULAR leaves — not a finite `ContextFreeGrammar` — precisely because the `Value` alphabet is
infinite.

A regular leaf over `Value` with pin-shaped `Pred` atoms is EXACTLY the object
`Crypto/Deriv/{SymbolicFixpoint,EquivalenceFixpoint}.lean` decide. This module points that decision
at the templater and asks the two questions a template author actually has:

1. **Can this guard ever be satisfied?** (a contradictory guard means the slot can NEVER be filled —
   the template is a brick.) — `emptyFix`, the runnable `≅`-fixpoint emptiness verdict.
2. **Did my template edit change what the slot accepts?** — `emptyFix` on `symDiff g g'`, the
   runnable language-equivalence decision, over words of EVERY length across the infinite alphabet.

## ═══ THE VERDICTS ═══

### Fragment (§1) — IN, at the CHEAPEST cover
`noDoubleBraceRE`'s leaves are `tt` (from `any`) and `braceP = symEq "t" 0`. Both are PIN atoms, so:

| fragment predicate | verdict | why |
|--------------------|---------|-----|
| `IsSymbolic` (pin/minterm cover, `SymbolicMinterms`) | **true** | `atomsOfLeaves? = some [("t", sym 0), ("t", sym 0)]` |
| `rigidRE` / `RigidFull` (`≅`-dedup side condition)   | **true** | free, via `rigidRE_of_isSymbolic` |
| `scalarRE` (threshold/interval cover, `SymbolicIntervals`) | **false** | `predIntervalAtoms?` covers `atom (.simple …)` comparisons; `symEq` is a SYMBOL pin, not a scalar threshold — no `Int` to compare |
| `differenceRE` (DBM cover, `SymbolicDifference`)     | **false** | `predDifference?` covers `atom`/`fieldEqField`; `symEq` is again outside — it names no difference coordinate |

So the blocking-atom question has a clean answer in the POSITIVE direction: the deployed guard needs
NONE of the later covers — the base pin cover (the cheapest committed one) reaches it exactly. The
`false`s above are not a wall; they are the statement that interval/DBM machinery is the wrong tool
for a symbol-tag guard.

⚑ This CORRECTS the scope of `Deriv/RealGuardAudit2.lean` row #9 ("templater string-span guards" =
RESIDUAL). That row is right about the **Rust** templater's byte/span guards, which are not authored
as a state `Pred` at all. It is NOT right about the **Lean** guarded templater: `noDoubleBraceRE` is
a `PredRE` over `Value` with a pin leaf, squarely IN the base fragment — and this file decides it.

### Emptiness / satisfiability (§2)
* `emptyFix (fixCands noDoubleBraceRE) 64 noDoubleBraceRE = some false` — **SATISFIABLE**. The
  deployed brace-ban is not a brick; the frontier saturates in **11** `≅`-classes over 3 candidate
  frames. (A `some true` here would have meant the templater could never render.)
* satisfiable by a NON-EMPTY slot too (`noDoubleBraceRE ⋒ any ⬝ any*` — `some false`), so the
  `some false` above is not riding the trivial `[]` witness.
* the CONTRADICTORY guard `noDoubleBraceRE ⋒ BB` ("ban `{{` and require `{{`") decides
  **`some true` = EMPTY at all word lengths** — the decision can say "brick", and §4 turns that into
  a theorem: no hole data whatsoever satisfies such a template.

### Equivalence of guard spellings (§3) — the killer app
Each row is `emptyFix` on the symmetric difference, `some true` = the two spellings accept EXACTLY
the same words (every length, infinite alphabet), `some false` = a separating word exists. Every
row is ALSO a `Prop`: the last column is the theorem that carries it.

| edit to the deployed guard | spelling | verdict | `Prop` |
|----------------------------|----------|---------|--------|
| re-associate the `cat` chain | `neg ((any* ⬝ {) ⬝ ({ ⬝ any*))` | **EQUIVALENT** | `assoc_langEq` (hand) |
| conjoin a total guard        | `noDoubleBraceRE ⋒ any*`        | **EQUIVALENT** | `redundant_langEq` (hand) |
| rewrite POSITIVELY (no complement) | `(¬{ ⋓ ({ ⬝ ¬{))* ⬝ (ε ⋓ {)` | **EQUIVALENT** | `pos_langEq` (DECISION) |
| drop the trailing `any*`     | `neg (any* ⬝ { ⬝ {)`            | **NOT EQUIVALENT** | `noTail_not_langEq` (DECISION) |
| "just check it isn't literally `{{`" | `neg ({ ⬝ {)`           | **NOT EQUIVALENT** | `exactly_not_langEq` (hand) + `exactly_not_langEq_fix` (DECISION) |

The two NOT-EQUIVALENT rows are REAL refactor bugs, and §3 exhibits the separating words the
decision predicted: `[data, {, {]` and `[{, {, data]` are REJECTED by the deployed guard and
ACCEPTED by the weakened spellings. §4 turns the second one into a theorem: a concrete hole
assignment that the refactored template calls safe and the deployed template calls unsafe, and
(`pos_edit_preserves`) the positive rewrite into a template-level safety-preservation theorem.

## Resource discipline — MEASURED, not assumed
The Bool route is the default: raw `emptyFix` over the SAME candidate covers the proven decisions
compute (`fixCands`, the `coverOfSymbolic` arm), fired by `#guard` (compiled evaluation). Fuels are
64–256; every frontier saturates in ≤ 20 `≅`-classes.

Where a verdict is worth a `Prop`, it is CROSSED — and the crossing was measured, not feared. The
three decision-carried rows above run `predRE_equivalence_decidable_fix` (EquivalenceFixpoint) at
fuel 256 through `of_decide_eq_{true,false}`, i.e. a real KERNEL reduction of the `≅`-fixpoint on
the symmetric difference. Cost of all three together, `/usr/bin/time -l` over `lake env lean` on
this file (3 runs, warm): **+2.1 s CPU and +0.16 GB peak RSS** — whole file 3.5 s → 5.6 s user,
1.81 GB → 1.97 GB peak, against a bare-import baseline of 1.5 s / 1.78 GB (i.e. nearly all of the
absolute memory is loading mathlib oleans, not the fixpoint). Wall clock is I/O-noise-dominated at
this size (5–9 s either way), so CPU is the honest figure. That is nowhere near the 64GB/20min
hazard an earlier revision of this header ASSERTED it would be — wrong by ~2.5 orders of magnitude
in time and ~2.5 in memory — and the assertion is retracted. The reason it is cheap is structural:
the adaptive worklist saturates in a HANDFUL of `≅`-classes — 13 classes over 13 candidate frames
for the positive spelling (least saturating fuel 171), 17 over 9 frames for refactor #2 (fuel 155),
11 over 9 for refactor #1 (fuel 101) — so the kernel never touches the `emptinessBound` powerset.
Fuel above the saturation point is FREE (the worklist returns as soon as `pending` empties), which
is why 256 is safe to carry.

Still NO `native_decide` anywhere. The two hand proofs (`assoc_langEq`, `redundant_langEq`) remain
independent CONFIRMATIONS of the machine's verdict on their pairs, and `exactly_not_langEq` is
hand-proven with `exactly_not_langEq_fix` agreeing — decision and theorem agree wherever both
exist.

## Semantic resolution
Verdicts are over `Value` words at the `symEq "t"`-pin resolution — the alphabet `HandlebarsGuarded`
itself uses (`braceVal`/`dataVal` are its `Tok` embedding, `tokVal`). They are IN-SLOT statements
about ONE hole's guard, exactly like `guardedSafe`; the cross-junction residual named in
`HandlebarsGuarded` §7 is untouched here.

`#assert_all_clean`, `sorry`-free.

/-! ## §1 IS THE DEPLOYED GUARD IN THE DECIDABLE FRAGMENT? — yes, at the base pin cover.

`noDoubleBraceRE = neg (any* ⬝ braceP ⬝ braceP ⬝ any*)`; its leaves are `tt` (from `PredRE.any`) and
`braceP = symEq "t" 0`. `predAtoms?` accepts both, so the pin/minterm cover applies; the later
interval and DBM covers do NOT (and need not). -/

Five plausible rewrites of the deployed guard. `emptyFix` on `symDiff` decides each. Three are

/-! ### The separating words the `some false` verdicts predicted, exhibited.

`[data, {, {]` and `[{, {, data]` both contain a `{{`, so the DEPLOYED guard rejects them; each
weakened spelling ACCEPTS one of them. These are the concrete injections the refactor would let
through. (`#guard` on the executable matcher — a `Prop`-level version of the second is `bad_edit`
in §4.) -/

#guard derives [dataVal, braceVal, braceVal] noDoubleBraceRE = false  -- deployed: rejected
#guard derives [dataVal, braceVal, braceVal] nodbExactly     = true   -- refactor #2: ADMITTED
#guard derives [braceVal, braceVal, dataVal] noDoubleBraceRE = false  -- deployed: rejected
#guard derives [braceVal, braceVal, dataVal] nodbNoTail      = true   -- refactor #1: ADMITTED

-- ...and the weakened guards are not vacuous — each still rejects the word it was written for:
#guard derives [braceVal, braceVal] nodbExactly = false
#guard derives [braceVal, braceVal] nodbNoTail  = false

/-! ### Two of the EQUIVALENT verdicts, re-derived by hand.

A `#guard` proves no `Prop`. For the two rewrites whose identity is elementary, the equivalence is
PROVEN — and it agrees with the machine. (`nodbPos ≡ noDoubleBraceRE` is the one that genuinely
needs the decision procedure: it is a different machine, not an algebraic identity.) -/

  exact Bool.noConfusion hw

/-! ### The remaining verdicts, CROSSED from `#guard` to `Prop` by the running decision.

The positive spelling is the one with no algebraic identity to hand-prove — it is a genuinely
different machine — and dropping the trailing `any*` likewise had only a `#guard`. Both are lifted
here by RUNNING `predRE_equivalence_decidable_fix` (EquivalenceFixpoint §2) in the kernel: it is
`emptyFix` on the symmetric difference (the very `#guard`s above) composed with the proven
`emptyFix_some_iff` and `langEq_iff_symDiff_empty`, so `of_decide_eq_{true,false}` yields the
`∀ w`-statement itself. MEASURED cost, all three: +2.1–2.4 s CPU / +0.16–0.19 GB (an independent verify's 3 warm runs averaged 5.81 s / 1.99 GB whole-file vs the 5.62 s / 1.97 GB recorded here — same order, ~12% above; treat these as a range, not a point) peak RSS — see the header's
resource note, which used to assert the opposite without measuring. -/

def nodbPosR : RigidSymbolicRE :=
  ⟨⟨nodbPos, by rw [IsSymbolic]; rfl⟩, show rigidRE nodbPos = true from rfl⟩

/-- REFACTOR BUG #2, bundled. -/
def nodbExactlyR : RigidSymbolicRE :=
  ⟨⟨nodbExactly, by rw [IsSymbolic]; rfl⟩, show rigidRE nodbExactly = true from rfl⟩

/-- **The POSITIVE rewrite is FAITHFUL — as a `Prop`.** The deployed brace-ban and its
complement-free spelling accept EXACTLY the same `Value` words, at EVERY length, over the infinite
alphabet. No hand proof relates these two machines; the fixpoint decision does, in 13 `≅`-classes.
This is the verdict this file previously left at `#guard` resolution. -/
theorem pos_langEq : ∀ w, derives w noDoubleBraceRE = derives w nodbPos :=
  @of_decide_eq_true _ (predRE_equivalence_decidable_fix 256 nodbR nodbPosR) (by rfl)

/-- **Dropping the trailing `any*` is a REAL weakening — as a `Prop`.** Some word separates the
deployed guard from refactor #1 (the `#guard`s exhibit `[{, {, data]`). -/

  @of_decide_eq_false _ (predRE_equivalence_decidable_fix 256 nodbR nodbNoTailR) (by rfl)

/-- Refactor #2's separation, re-derived by the DECISION — the same statement

directions this time (the hand proof exhibits a witness; the decision quantifies over all
words). -/

carries a guard whose language is empty, then NO data assignment whatsoever is `guardedSafe`, hence

`assoc_edit_preserves`, no algebraic identity backs this — it rides `pos_langEq`, i.e. the

/-! ## §6 RESIDUALS — named precisely, not `sorry`-ed.

* **(machine-verdict → `Prop`: CROSSED, and the old cost claim RETRACTED)** An earlier revision of
  this section said the kernel reduction needed for the crossing "is exactly the 64GB/20min hazard"
  and refused to run it, leaving `nodbPos ≡ noDoubleBraceRE` at `#guard` resolution. That was an
  ASSERTED cost, never measured, and it was wrong. Measured (`/usr/bin/time -l`, this file, 3 warm
  runs): crossing ALL THREE remaining verdicts costs **+2.1–2.4 s CPU / +0.16–0.19 GB (an independent verify's 3 warm runs averaged 5.81 s / 1.99 GB whole-file vs the 5.62 s / 1.97 GB recorded here — same order, ~12% above; treat these as a range, not a point) peak RSS** — whole
  file 3.5 s → 5.6 s user and 1.81 GB → 1.97 GB, against a 1.5 s / 1.78 GB bare-import baseline, so
  the memory is mathlib oleans either way. ~2.5 orders of magnitude below the claimed hazard on
  both axes (20 min → 2.1 s; 64 GB → 0.16 GB incremental) — and a deliberately FALSE variant of the
  same reduction (claiming `nodbNoTail` equivalent) is REJECTED by `rfl`, so the crossing is doing
  real discriminating work, not reducing to a tautology. So §3 now
  crosses them: `pos_langEq`, `noTail_not_langEq`, `exactly_not_langEq_fix` are `Prop`s produced by
  `predRE_equivalence_decidable_fix 256 nodbR _` (i.e. `emptyFix_some_iff` ∘
  `langEq_iff_symDiff_empty`, kernel-reduced), and `pos_edit_preserves` cashes the positive rewrite
  at the template level. The residual that REMAINS is narrow and structural: cheapness here is a
  property of THESE machines (13 `≅`-classes, 13 candidate frames, saturating fuel ≤ 171), not a
  general bound — the missing counting step in `SymbolicFixpoint`'s termination note (fuel
  `(emptinessBound R + 1) * (|V| + 1) + 1` suffices) is still unproven, so a bigger guard's
  crossing must be MEASURED again rather than assumed cheap. Measure, do not assert, in either
  direction.

* **(cover fidelity)** `fixCands` mirrors the `coverOfSymbolic` arm of the decision instances, so the
  raw `emptyFix` guards exercise the SAME search the instances would. It contains duplicate
  candidates (the pin `("t", sym 0)` is mentioned twice, so `atomCands` emits it twice); that costs
  branching factor, never correctness — the cover only has to CONTAIN a witness per minterm.

* **(in-slot, as always)** Every verdict is about ONE hole's guard language. The cross-junction
  breakout named in `HandlebarsGuarded` §7 (a guard-conforming slot abutting a literal can still
  form a delimiter across the junction) is a property of the CONCATENATION, not of any single guard,
  and no per-guard decision can see it.

* **(`RealGuardAudit2` row #9, re-scoped)** That row's RESIDUAL verdict is correct for the Rust
  templater's byte/span guards and for `RoleCapMap::holds`, neither of which is a state `Pred`. It
  over-reached in listing "`Dregg2/Crypto/HandlebarsGuarded*.lean`" as residual: the Lean guarded
  templater's guards ARE `PredRE` over `Value` with pin leaves, and this file decides the deployed
  one. The honest residual there is the RUST side.
