# Dregg2.Crypto.HandlebarsGuardedParse — the VERIFIER-SIDE half: a language member IS a render.

Everything the guarded-templater stack proved so far runs GENERATOR → OUTPUT:
`HandlebarsGuarded.guarded_render_mem_language` consumes a `d` already in hand
(`guardedSafe T d → render T d ∈ (guardedToGrammar T).language`), and
`HandlebarsGuardedUniqueness.guarded_render_injective` says AT MOST ONE guard-satisfied `d` can
produce a given output. Neither one lets a party holding only `(T, output)` conclude anything: the
existence / PARSE direction

    output ∈ (guardedToGrammar T).language → ∃ d, guardedSafe T d ∧ render T d = output

was an OPEN residual, named three times in the tree (`Handlebars.lean` §9 `RESIDUAL (round_trip)`,
`HandlebarsUniqueness.lean` §6 `RESIDUAL (general_round_trip)`, `HandlebarsGuarded.lean` §7
`RESIDUAL (guarded_uniqueness)`). This module DISCHARGES it, and composes it with the existing
injectivity into a real `∃!`.

## The class where it is TRUE (named in the theorem, not buried)

The parse direction needs **DISTINCT HOLE IDS** (`(holesOf T).Nodup`) — and nothing else. It does NOT
need separation: separation is what makes the recovered data UNIQUE, not what makes it EXIST.

Distinctness is genuinely load-bearing, not hygiene: a template naming the SAME hole twice renders it
twice with the SAME data, while the language lets the two spans differ, so language members exist that
no assignment renders. `nodup_is_load_bearing` (§6) PROVES this — a `SeparatedTemplate` whose two holes
share id `0`, and a language member of even length while every render of it has odd length. That is the
exact dual of `HandlebarsGuardedUniqueness.abutting_ambiguous` (which proves the separation
side-condition load-bearing for UNIQUENESS): one wall per direction, both demonstrated.

## What is proven (no `sorry`, no new axioms)

* `assign` — the EXTRACTOR: read the per-hole data straight off a span decomposition. Computable, so
  the recovered `d` can be run (§5 `#guard`s evaluate it on a concrete output).
* `parse_exists_distinct_holes` — THE THEOREM: for `(holesOf T).Nodup`, every member of the induced
  language is `render T d` for some guard-satisfying `d`. Proof rides `GuardedSpans`'
  `mem_language_iff_spans` (membership ⇔ a per-segment span decomposition, literals pinned and hole
  spans matcher-attested) and reads `d` off the spans.
* `separated_parse_unique_pointwise` / `separated_parse_exists_unique` — the `∃!` the stack has been
  claiming and not owning: on a `SeparatedTemplate` with distinct hole ids, a language member
  determines its per-hole data EXACTLY ONE way. The second form is a literal `ExistsUnique`, over the
  ordered hole-data vector `(holesOf T).map d` — the honest object, since `d`'s values OFF `holesOf T`
  are unconstrained by the output (a raw `∃! d` is FALSE for that reason alone).
* `Demo` (§5) — the theorem FIRES: a separated 2-hole template and the concrete output
  `data { { {` are fed in and the recovered `d` is COMPUTED — hole 0 ↦ `[data]`, hole 1 ↦ `[{, {]` —
  with the guards re-run on the recovered data by the verified matcher. `#guard`s pin every value.

/-! ## §2 `assign` — THE EXTRACTOR: read the per-hole data off a span decomposition.

`GuardedSpans.mem_language_iff_spans` turns membership into a per-segment span list. `assign` walks
segments and spans in lockstep and hands each hole-id the span sitting at its position. It is a plain
computable function, so the recovered assignment can be RUN (§5). -/

`i` is given `spans[i]`; ids not named by `segs` get `[]`. -/

  | [], _ => fun _ => []
  | _ :: _, [] => fun _ => []

/-- **`assign_guardedSafe`** — every hole's RECOVERED data satisfies that hole's OWN guard, decided by
the verified matcher. The obligation is exactly the `SpanOk` hole clause; distinctness of hole ids is
what guarantees the span `assign` hands back at `id` is the span `SpanOk` constrained. -/

/-- **`assign_render`** — the RECOVERED assignment reproduces the word: rendering the segments under
`assign` reconstructs exactly the concatenation of the spans. Distinctness of hole ids is load-bearing
here too: `assign` gives a repeated id its FIRST span, so the id's later occurrence would print that
first span again instead of its own (§6 turns this into a proved counterexample). -/

/-! ## §3 THE THEOREM — the verifier-side existence / parse direction. -/

/-- **`parse_exists_distinct_holes`** — THE VERIFIER-SIDE HALF, on the DISTINCT-HOLE-ID class. A party
holding only `(T, output)` and a proof that `output` is in `T`'s induced language may conclude that
`output` IS an expansion of `T`: there EXISTS per-hole data, each piece satisfying its OWN guard
(decided by the verified matcher), whose render is exactly `output`. Nothing not generated by `T`
under its guards can sit in the language.

The side-condition is `(holesOf T).Nodup` — the template names each hole at most once — and it is
genuinely required (`nodup_is_load_bearing`, §6), NOT an artifact of the proof. Separation is NOT
required here: separation buys UNIQUENESS of the recovered data (§4), not its existence.

Route: `GuardedSpans.mem_language_iff_spans` converts membership into a per-segment span
decomposition (literal spans pinned to the template text, hole spans matcher-attested); `assign`
reads the data off those spans; §2 discharges both obligations. -/
theorem parse_exists_distinct_holes (T : GuardedTemplate) (hnd : (holesOf T).Nodup)
    (output : List Value) (hmem : output ∈ (guardedToGrammar T).language) :
    ∃ d : Nat → List Value, guardedSafe T d ∧ render T d = output := by
  obtain ⟨spans, hok, rfl⟩ := (mem_language_iff_spans T output).mp hmem
  exact ⟨assign T.segments spans,
         assign_guardedSafe T.segments spans hok hnd,
         assign_render T.segments spans hok hnd⟩

/-! ## §4 The `∃!` — composing the new existence half with the landed injectivity. -/

/-- **`separated_parse_unique_pointwise`** — EXISTENCE + UNIQUENESS, pointwise form. On a
`SeparatedTemplate` with distinct hole ids, every language member is the render of guard-satisfying
data, and that data is forced on every hole the template names. Existence is
`parse_exists_distinct_holes` (§3); uniqueness is
`HandlebarsGuardedUniqueness.guarded_render_injective`. This is the round trip, both halves owned. -/
theorem separated_parse_unique_pointwise (T : GuardedTemplate)
    (hsep : SeparatedTemplate T) (hnd : (holesOf T).Nodup)
    (output : List Value) (hmem : output ∈ (guardedToGrammar T).language) :
    ∃ d : Nat → List Value,
      guardedSafe T d ∧ render T d = output ∧

  refine ⟨d, hsafe, hrender, fun d' hsafe' hr' => ?_⟩
  exact guarded_render_injective T hsep d' d hsafe' hsafe (by rw [hr', hrender])

/-- **`separated_parse_exists_unique`** — a literal `ExistsUnique`, over the object that IS determined:
the ordered per-hole data vector `(holesOf T).map d`. On a `SeparatedTemplate` with distinct hole ids,
a language member has EXACTLY ONE guard-satisfying hole-data vector.

Stated on the vector rather than on `d` itself deliberately: `d`'s values at ids the template does NOT
name are unconstrained by the output, so a raw `∃! d` would be FALSE for a trivial reason. The vector
is the honest carrier of "the data that produced this output". -/

  exact List.map_congr_left (huniq d' hsafe' hr')

/-! ## §5 NON-VACUITY — the theorem FIRES, and the recovered data COMPUTES.

The template is `HandlebarsGuardedUniqueness.Demo.demoSpine`:
`hole 0 (noBraceRE) · lit[{] · hole 1 (star any)` — separated (hole 0's guard excludes the `{`
delimiter), distinct ids `[0, 1]`. The output fed in is `data { { {` — written as a LITERAL WORD, never
as `render T d` for some hand-chosen `d`. It reaches the parse theorem only as a language member, and
the assignment comes back out. Hole 1's recovered data is a DOUBLE brace — admitted by its permissive
guard, REJECTED by hole 0's — so the recovery is discriminating, not a constant. -/
