# `Dregg2.Crypto.HashSigMerkleRegrounded` — the SLH-DSA / SPHINCS+ MANY-TIME hash-signature KEY-SWAP
binding, as a SECURITY REDUCTION to a collision game at a class with content.

## The gap this closes

`HashSigMerkle.merkle_ots_binds_index` is the BINDING floor of the many-time hash signature (a Merkle
root over `N` one-time keys — the SLH-DSA / SPHINCS+ shape): any verifying signature at index `i`
carries EXACTLY the OTS public key committed at `i` (no key swap), so a verifying forgery is a genuine
Lamport forgery on the committed key. It is conditioned on `Poseidon2Binding.Poseidon2SpongeCR hash` —
the injective sponge floor `HashFloorHonesty.poseidon2SpongeCR_false_babyBear` PROVES FALSE (a
compressing sponge has collisions by pigeonhole). At the deployed p3 Poseidon2 sponge the key-swap
binding is therefore VACUOUSLY TRUE.

## ⚑ WHAT THIS FILE USED TO EXPORT, AND WHY IT IS GONE

The previous export was

    theorem merkle_ots_binds_advantage_bound (hCR : CollisionResistant F) (leafSwap : CollisionFinder F)
      : Negl (collisionAdv F leafSwap)

which is the SAME DISEASE one costume along. `FloorGames.collisionResistant_iff_hashCRHardQuant_top`
proves `CollisionResistant F` is definitionally the collision floor at the UNRESTRICTED adversary
class, and `collisionResistant_false_of_compressing` proves THAT false for any compressing family —
the deployed sponge included. So the replacement hypothesis was refuted at deployed parameters exactly
like the one it replaced, and the theorem transported no security. It is DELETED, not kept beside the
repair.

Its `_eff` sibling was better (a floor at an explicit class) but still not a reduction: it took a
`CollisionFinder F` and applied the floor to it. Hypothesis and conclusion were the same object, so
there was no game about the KEY SWAP at all — the forgery never appeared in a `Prop`.

## What replaces them (§2–§4)

  * **§2 — the key swap is a first-class `Game`.** `keySwapGame` hands the adversary a sampled
    domain-separation tag; it WINS iff it outputs a key set, an index, a message and a signature such
    that the signature VERIFIES against the master root at that index (the deployed `mverify`, read off
    the real `masterKey`) while carrying a public key DIFFERENT from the one committed there. The
    forgery is IN the win relation, on the deployed acceptance predicate.
  * **§3 — the extractor is a map of adversaries.** `keySwapToFinder` returns
    `(pkEncode s.pk, pkEncode (publicKey H (sks i)))`. `keySwap_wins_imp` proves that pair is a GENUINE
    sponge collision: the opening places the claimed key's leaf where the committed key's leaf is, so
    the two encodings hash equal, and `pkEncode_injective` contraposed makes them distinct. This is
    exactly the step `merkle_ots_binds_index` spends its (false) injectivity hypothesis on.
  * **§4 — the bound at an arbitrary class; §6 the DISCHARGED keyed-ROM successor.**
    `keySwap_binds_advantage_bound` is the reduction at an arbitrary class. ⚑ The `IsPolyTime`
    discharge that stood beside it (`merkle_ots_binds_from_polyTime`) is DELETED (07-24): its floor
    `HashCRHardQuant (spongeFamily D) (IsPolyTime …)` is REFUTED at deployed parameters
    (`Exec.SystemRootsBindingReduction.sysRoots_floor_polyTime_false_babyBear`). §6 restates the
    key-swap game at the SAMPLED keyed oracle (the win relation applies the oracle inside the deployed
    `mverify`/`masterKey`/`keyLog`, which are PARAMETRIC in the sponge) and closes it from
    `KeyedRomFloor.keyedRom_hard` — the birthday bound, PROVED, nothing refutable carried.

## ⚑ THE NAMED, SEPARATELY-PRICED RESIDUAL — say it out loud

`merkle_ots_binds_index` spends its sponge floor TWICE: once on the leaf (closed here) and once on
`MMR.mroot_injective`, which peels the whole `bag`/`hashOf` forest to conclude the opened log IS the
genuine key log. The key-swap game carries `openLog = keyLog …` as an explicit SIDE CONDITION, so this
file closes the LEAF leg only. **The MMR root leg is NOT closed and is not pretended to be:**
`MMR.bag_injective` / `MMR.mroot_injective` still ride the refuted injective `Poseidon2SpongeCR` and
have no extractor. That is a real open carrier, named here so it is countable rather than absorbed.

## Non-fake

The break game is refutable (§5: on the constant-`0` sponge a key swap succeeds at every tag), the
canary refuses the floor applied at ANOTHER finder, and both poles of the class are priced. No `sorry`,
no fresh `axiom`, no `native_decide`.

/-! ## §1 — the deployed sponge, as a KEYED family.

The deployed p3 Poseidon2 sponge is UNKEYED; its domain separation is the effective key, which is what
a `KeyedHashFamily`'s `Key` is for (`HashFloorHonesty` §2). `SpongeDeployment` carries the tag space the
collision game samples and the sponge at each tag, and asserts NOTHING false about the sponge — in
particular no injectivity field, which is what made the old carrier uninhabitable at real parameters. -/

/-- **THE KEY-SWAP GAME.** The adversary is handed a sampled domain-separation tag and WINS iff it
presents a signature that

  1. is at the attacked index (`s.idx = i`),

     complementary case is the MMR root leg, `MMR.mroot_injective`, NOT closed here), and
  4. nonetheless carries a public key DIFFERENT from the one committed at that index.

A win is exactly the key swap `HashSigMerkle.merkle_ots_binds_index` denies: a verifying many-time
signature whose OTS layer runs under a key the master root never committed. The forgery is IN the win
relation. (`winsDec` is classical: the win quantifies over `verify`'s `∀ i` at an arbitrary `ℓ`, and

/-- **THE EXTRACTOR, AS A MAP OF ADVERSARIES.** A key swapper becomes a sponge-collision finder by
handing back the two FLATTENED public keys — the one it swapped in and the one the master root
committed. This is not a rename: the swapper's leverage is the whole verifying signature, and the
finder sees only the two encodings; the collision has to be RE-DERIVED on the other side
(`keySwap_wins_imp`). -/

/-- **⚑ WIN-PRESERVATION — and this IS `merkle_ots_binds_index`'s crypto step, contraposed.** Wherever
the swapper wins, the two flattened keys are a GENUINE sponge collision. The derivation is the one the
old keystone ran under the false injectivity hypothesis: the opening places the CLAIMED key's leaf at
the attacked index, the genuine key log places the COMMITTED key's leaf there, so the two `pkLeaf`s —
i.e. the sponge at the two encodings — are EQUAL; and `pkEncode_injective` contraposed against the win's
`pk ≠ committed pk` makes the two encodings DISTINCT. Injectivity used to consume this equality; here it
is handed to the collision floor instead. -/

/-- **⚑ RE-GROUNDED `HashSigMerkle.merkle_ots_binds_index` — from the sponge's collision floor, VIA the
reduction.**

Under the DEPLOYED sponge's collision floor at the class `Eff`, a key swapper whose extracted finder is
in that class has NEGLIGIBLE advantage: a verifying many-time signature carries the OTS public key the
master root committed EXCEPT with negligible probability, so `lamport_forgery_breaks_hash` applies to
the genuine key except with that advantage. The Boolean "no key swap", which needed the FALSE injective
sponge floor, becomes an honest advantage bound on a hypothesis a real sponge can satisfy.

The extractor is a pure output reshaping with the sampled tag passed through — an `Adversary.postMap` —
so `isPolyTime_postMap` turns `hEff` into a consequence of "the key swapper is efficient". The one
per-site fact is the extractor's output size, and it is PROVED: `pkEncode` flattens a `Fin ℓ → Bool → ℤ`
into exactly `2ℓ` felts, whatever the key, so the finder writes `4ℓ` felts — a CONSTANT at fixed
parameters. -/

WRONG advantage, and only `keySwap_adv_le` connects the extracted finder to the key-swap game. This

it compiles now, and reds if a future edit reconnects the games. -/

SAMPLED keyed oracle `H : Tag × Msg → Fin (2 ^ l)` over the truncated deployed message shape (at most
`m` BabyBear-range limbs, `SpongeForgeReduction.intListBVec` — lossless on everything the deployed
prover absorbs, `intListBVec_inj`). The deployed `mverify` / `masterKey` / `keyLog` are PARAMETRIC in
the sponge, so the ROM game's win relation applies them at the ORACLE read back as a sponge
(`oracleSponge`): nothing about the Merkle acceptance predicate is re-authored — only WHO evaluates
the absorbed blocks changes, which is the modelling step. The two `GoodCode` conjuncts in the win
relation are the truncation's honesty teeth: the extracted flattened keys are bounded (`pkEncode`
emits exactly `2ℓ` limbs) in-range felt lists — the deployed key material's genuine layout — so a
distinct pair stays distinct through the truncation. The OTS bit hash `H : ℤ → ℤ` stays a parameter,
exactly as in §2: this file closes the SPONGE leg, and the MMR-root leg stays the named open carrier
of the header. -/
