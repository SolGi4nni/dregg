# `Dregg2.Crypto.HermineHashCRRegrounded` — the Hermine commit-reveal `HashCR` consumers RE-GROUNDED
off the VACUOUS injective floor onto the PROPER keyed `CollisionResistant` floor.

## The bug this closes (the commit-reveal half of the 07-13 floor sweep)

`HermineHintMLWE.HashCR cr := ∀ i w w', cr.H i w = cr.H i w' → w = w'` is stated as **injectivity** of
the commit map, and `HashFloorHonesty.hashCR_false_of_compressing` PROVES it FALSE for any COMPRESSING
commit-reveal (`|C| < |W|` — pigeonhole forces two reveals to one commitment). So every Hermine
binding consumer conditioned on it — `commitment_binding`, `equivocation_breaks_hashcr`,
`concurrent_forgery_breaks_hashcr_or_msis`, `concurrent_unforgeable_reduces`, and the DEPLOYED-reachable
`RevocationSoundness` / `IdentityCommitment` reuses of the SAME `CommitReveal`/`HashCR` — is VACUOUSLY
TRUE at real parameters. `HashFloorHonesty` landed the honest floor (`CollisionResistant`) and the
advantage template; `FloorRegroundedConsumers` moved the STARK/FRI side. This file moves the Hermine
COMMIT-REVEAL side.

## The re-grounding

* **`commitRevealFamily`** — the concrete bridge: a Hermine `CommitReveal Idx W C` at a fixed index `i`
  becomes a `KeyedHashFamily` (`Input = W`, `Out = C`, `H _ _ w = cr.H i w`). This is the keyed hash the
  honest collision game lives over.
* **`commitRevealFamily_CR_of_hashcr`** — the OLD-floor ⟹ NEW-floor bridge: if the injective `HashCR cr`
  held it would discharge `CollisionResistant (commitRevealFamily cr i)` (via `injective_family_CR`), so
  the old floor was STRICTLY STRONGER than needed — and, being false for a compressing commitment, empty.
* **`commitOpenGame` / `openToFinder` / `hermine_commitment_binding_advantage_bound`** — the
  commitment-opening break, as a SECURITY REDUCTION. ⚑ THIS REPLACES two earlier exports that are now
  DELETED, not kept beside it: the bare-CR form took `CollisionResistant F`, which
  `collisionResistant_iff_hashCRHardQuant_top` proves IS the floor at the UNRESTRICTED class and
  `collisionResistant_false_of_compressing` proves FALSE for every compressing (i.e. real) commit hash —
  a refuted hypothesis, exactly the disease the sweep exists to name; and its `_eff` sibling took a
  `CollisionFinder` and applied the floor TO IT, so hypothesis and conclusion were the same object and the
  OPENING never appeared in a `Prop`. The replacement makes the opening a `Game` (an adversary that
  publishes a commitment and two reveals that both open it), extracts a collision finder by DISCARDING the
  commitment, and proves the advantage inequality unconditionally.
* ⚑ **The `IsPolyTime` discharges are DELETED (07-24).** `hermine_commitment_binding_from_polyTime`
  and `hermine_concurrent_forgery_from_polyTime` discharged `hEff` at `Eff := IsPolyTime`, whose floor
  `HashCRHardQuant … (IsPolyTime …)` is REFUTED at deployed parameters
  (`Exec.SystemRootsBindingReduction.sysRoots_floor_polyTime_false_babyBear`: `IsPolyTime` prices
  answer SIZE, so a `.pure` answerer with a hardcoded short collision is in the class and wins with
  probability `1`). Their DISCHARGED successors live on the PROVED keyed-ROM floor: the generic
  opening binding is `Crypto.RomCarrierSites.rom_open_binds` (the `commitOpenGame` shape at the
  sampled oracle, floor = `KeyedRomFloor.keyedRom_hard`), instantiated per site by
  `IdentityCommitmentRegrounded` / `WireAkeRegrounded` / `RandomnessBeaconRegrounded` /
  `XmVrfRefinementRegrounded`; the concurrent-forgery composition's equivocation horn is discharged
  there by `Crypto.HermineRomBinding.hermine_concurrent_forgery_rom` (`cfEquivRom_hard`). The
  `_advantage_bound` forms below stay the honest fixed-hash statements with `hEff` in the open.

## ⚑ The concurrent-forgery keystone, ROUTED THROUGH THE REAL DICHOTOMY (the 2026-07-17 repair)

`hermine_concurrent_forgery_advantage_bound` is the advantage-bounded sibling of
`concurrent_forgery_breaks_hashcr_or_msis` / `concurrent_unforgeable_reduces`. Until 07-17 it carried a
FREE ensemble unconnected to any forger:

    (adv : S → Ensemble) (s : S) (hmsis : MSISHardQuantShape adv) : Negl (… + adv s n)

whose MSIS leg was `hmsis s` — a `P → P` instantiation of the content-free `MSISHardQuantShape`
(`ProbCrypto`; `HardQuantVacuity` FINDING-1 / `VACUITY-SWEEP.md` documented this exact site). It assumed
the MSIS hardness it should DERIVE from the forger. The HashCR leg was already sound; only the MSIS leg
was rotten.

Now the reduction is a chain of proof terms, MIRRORING the VRF repair (`VrfRegrounded`):

  * **`concurrentForgeryGame`** — a first-class λ-indexed game: the adversary is handed a sampled
    instance (`A`, key `t`, commit map, target commitment `cm`) and WINS iff it opens `cm` with two
    reveals `w`, `w'` and outputs two accepting SelfTargetMSIS solutions with `c ≠ c'`. The forgery is IN
    the win relation; nothing here is a docstring.
  * **`forgeryToMsisSolver`** — the extractor as a map of adversaries: the difference `(z − z', −(c − c'))`
    of `selftarget_extract_nonzero`, written as a function into `msisGame (cfMsisFamily F)`.
  * **`forgeryToEquivFinder`** — the equivocation adversary as a map: the two reveals `(w, w')` into the
    commit-collision game `cfEquivGame F`.
  * **`forgery_wins_imp`** — the dichotomy `concurrent_forgery_breaks_hashcr_or_msis` at the game level:
    every instance the forger wins, EITHER the extracted vector is an `IsMSISSolution` (bound: `w = w'`)
    OR the two reveals are a genuine commit collision (equivocated: `w ≠ w'`).
  * **`forgery_adv_le`** — the UNION BOUND: `gameAdv forgery ≤ gameAdv msis (extracted) + gameAdv equiv
    (extracted)`, over the SHARED sampled-instance space, by `winProb_le_add_of_imp`.
  * **`hermine_concurrent_forgery_advantage_bound`** — the floors bite on the EXTRACTED solver and
    finder, at the games the reduction actually attacks. The Boolean dichotomy `¬HashCR ∨ MSIS-solution`
    becomes the additive negligible advantage — and, unlike its predecessor, this statement is FALSE if
    you delete the reduction: §5's canary compiles that fact.

⚑ **The `hEff`/`hEffH` obligations are UNDISCHARGED and that is the honest state** — the standard "the
reduction is efficient" side conditions, a PARAMETER because this tree has no cost model (`FloorGames`
§8). Both floors' honesty is exactly their `Eff`'s: `⊤` makes them FALSE at compressing parameters,
`⊥` vacuous. §6.

## Non-fake

The floor is SATISFIABLE (`commitRevealFamily_CR_of_hashcr` on the binding `HermineHintMLWE.exCR`
discharges it) and LOAD-BEARING (`badCR_family_not_CR`: the COLLIDING commit-reveal `HermineHintMLWE.badCR`
has an equivocator winning on every key, advantage `1`, so its family is NOT CR — the siblings cannot be
discharged there). The concrete `crEquivocator` is a genuine collision finder, not a relabel. Old
injective-floor consumers KEPT untouched; siblings ADDED. `#assert_all_clean`
(⊆ {propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}); no `sorry`, no fresh `axiom`.

## Coordination

This is the COMMIT-REVEAL binding lane. The STARK/FRI/Merkle hash consumers are
`Circuit.FloorRegroundedConsumers` (sibling lane); the decisional/lossy-MLWE and `MSISHard`-Boolean crypto
floors are `FloorBridge`/`CryptoFloorTeeth` (another sibling). It stays in the Hermine `CommitReveal`
subtree — no consumer moved here lives elsewhere.

/-! ## §1 — the concrete bridge: a Hermine commit-reveal becomes a keyed hash family. -/

/-- **THE COMMIT-REVEAL KEYED FAMILY.** A Hermine `CommitReveal Idx W C` at a fixed index `i` as a
`KeyedHashFamily`: reveals `W` are the inputs, commitments `C` the outputs, and the keyed hash is
`H _ _ w = cr.H i w` (a trivial `Unit` key — the deployed effective key is the domain-separation
index/tag). This is the keyed hash the proper collision game runs over. -/
def commitRevealFamily {Idx W C : Type} [DecidableEq W] [DecidableEq C]
    (cr : CommitReveal Idx W C) (i : Idx) : KeyedHashFamily where
  Key := fun _ => Unit
  Input := W
  Out := C
  H := fun _ _ w => cr.H i w
  keyFintype := fun _ => inferInstance
  keyNonempty := fun _ => inferInstance
  inputDecEq := inferInstance
  outDecEq := inferInstance

/-- **THE OLD-FLOOR ⟹ NEW-FLOOR BRIDGE.** If the injective `HashCR cr` held (per-index injectivity of the
commit map), it would discharge the proper `CollisionResistant (commitRevealFamily cr i)` (no collisions ⟹
every finder's advantage `0`, via `injective_family_CR`). So the OLD injective floor is STRICTLY STRONGER
than the honest computational floor — and, being FALSE for a compressing commitment
(`HashFloorHonesty.hashCR_false_of_compressing`), it was an empty hypothesis; the proper floor is the
satisfiable object the same binding reductions actually need. -/
theorem commitRevealFamily_CR_of_hashcr {Idx W C : Type} [DecidableEq W] [DecidableEq C]

  injective_family_CR (commitRevealFamily cr i) (fun _ _ w w' h => hcr i w w' h)

/-! ## §2 — the commitment OPENING, as a SECURITY REDUCTION.

⚑ **WHAT THIS SECTION USED TO EXPORT, AND WHY IT IS GONE.** Two theorems stood here:

  * `hermine_commitment_binding_advantage_bound (hCR : CollisionResistant F) (equivocator :
    CollisionFinder F)`. `FloorGames.collisionResistant_iff_hashCRHardQuant_top` proves
    `CollisionResistant F` IS the collision floor at the UNRESTRICTED adversary class, and
    `collisionResistant_false_of_compressing` proves THAT false for any compressing family — every real
    commit hash. So the hypothesis was REFUTED at deployed parameters and the theorem transported no
    security, which is the same defect it was written to repair, one costume along.
  * its `_eff` sibling, which took a `CollisionFinder F` and applied the floor to it. Hypothesis and
    conclusion were the SAME object: there was no game about the OPENING at all, so the deployed break —
    "two reveals both open the published commitment" — never appeared in a `Prop`.

Both are DELETED. What stands here instead is the shape the rest of the sweep uses: the break is a
first-class `Game` whose win relation mentions the PUBLISHED commitment, the reduction is a map of
adversaries, the advantage inequality is unconditional (no adversary class appears in it), and the
security conclusion is taken under a NAMED floor at an arbitrary class — the DISCHARGED instantiation
lives on the keyed-ROM floor (`RomCarrierSites.rom_open_binds` and the per-site `*_rom` successors;
the `IsPolyTime` discharge that stood in §2b is DELETED, its floor refuted).

The four downstream instantiations (`IdentityCommitmentRegrounded`, `WireAkeRegrounded`,
`XmVrfRefinementRegrounded`, `RandomnessBeaconRegrounded`) are rewired onto this object. -/

/-- **THE COMMITMENT-OPENING BREAK GAME.** The adversary is handed a sampled key and WINS iff it
publishes a commitment together with TWO DISTINCT reveals that BOTH open it under the deployed commit
hash. Winning is exactly the equivocated opening `HermineHintMLWE.commitment_binding` denies — and the
published commitment is IN the win relation, so this is a game about the deployed opening predicate
rather than the collision relation wearing a different name. -/
def commitOpenGame (F : KeyedHashFamily) : Game where
  Inst := F.Key
  Ans := fun _ => F.Out × F.Input × F.Input
  instFin := F.keyFintype
  instNe := F.keyNonempty
  wins := fun l k p => p.2.1 ≠ p.2.2 ∧ F.H l k p.2.1 = p.1 ∧ F.H l k p.2.2 = p.1
  winsDec := fun l k p => by
    letI := F.inputDecEq; letI := F.outDecEq
    infer_instance

/-- **THE PROBLEM IS IN THE STATEMENT** — a win unfolds, by `Iff.rfl`, to two distinct reveals opening
one published commitment. Not a docstring: the `Prop` itself. -/

      (p.2.1 ≠ p.2.2 ∧ F.H l k p.2.1 = p.1 ∧ F.H l k p.2.2 = p.1) :=
  Iff.rfl

/-- **THE EXTRACTOR, AS A MAP OF ADVERSARIES.** An equivocating opener becomes a collision finder by
DISCARDING the published commitment and keeping the two reveals. The commitment is where the opener's
leverage lives — the finder never sees it — so the collision must be RE-DERIVED on the other side
(`open_wins_imp`); the map throws structure away rather than renaming it. -/
def openToFinder (F : KeyedHashFamily) (A : Adversary (commitOpenGame F)) :
    Adversary (hashGame F) where
  run := fun l k => let p := A.run l k; (p.2.1, p.2.2)

/-- **⚑ WIN-PRESERVATION — and this IS `HermineHintMLWE.equivocation_breaks_hashcr`, at the game level.**
Wherever the opener wins, its two reveals are a GENUINE collision: they are distinct (the win's own side
condition) and both hash to the SAME published commitment, so they hash to each other. -/
theorem open_wins_imp (F : KeyedHashFamily) (A : Adversary (commitOpenGame F)) (l : ℕ) (k : F.Key l)
    (hwin : (commitOpenGame F).wins l k (A.run l k)) :
    (hashGame F).wins l k ((openToFinder F A).run l k) := by
  obtain ⟨hne, h1, h2⟩ := hwin
  exact ⟨hne, h1.trans h2.symm⟩

/-- **THE ADVANTAGE INEQUALITY.** The opener's advantage is at most the extracted finder's, at every
parameter — both play over the SAME sampled key space. Unconditional: no adversary class appears. -/
theorem open_adv_le (F : KeyedHashFamily) (A : Adversary (commitOpenGame F)) (l : ℕ) :
    gameAdv (commitOpenGame F) A l ≤ gameAdv (hashGame F) (openToFinder F A) l := by
  refine @winProb_le_of_imp _ (F.keyFintype l) _ _ (fun k hk => ?_)
  rw [Adversary.hit_eq_true] at hk ⊢
  exact open_wins_imp F A l k hk

/-- **⚑ RE-GROUNDED `HermineHintMLWE.commitment_binding` — from the commit hash's collision floor, VIA
the reduction.** Under the collision floor at the class `Eff`, an equivocating opener whose extracted
finder is in that class has NEGLIGIBLE advantage: a published commitment opens to ONE reveal except with
negligible probability. The Boolean "two openings ⟹ equal", which needed the FALSE injective `HashCR`,
becomes an honest advantage bound on a hypothesis a real commit hash can satisfy.

`hEff` is a parameter here because this is the statement at an ARBITRARY class; the DISCHARGED
instantiation is the keyed-ROM successor (`RomCarrierSites.rom_open_binds`; the `IsPolyTime` discharge
that stood here is deleted — its floor is refuted). -/

    (open_adv_le F A) (hD _ hEff)

/-- **(TOOTH — `Eff := ⊤` is FALSE at a compressing family.)** At the unrestricted class the honest floor
IS `CollisionResistant F` (`collisionResistant_iff_hashCRHardQuant_top`), which is FALSE for any
compressing commit hash (`collisionResistant_false_of_compressing`). This is the price of restricting the
class, stated as a theorem — and it is precisely why the DELETED bare-CR export bought nothing. -/
theorem hermine_binding_eff_top_false_of_compressing {F : KeyedHashFamily} (hin : Nonempty F.Input)
    (hcol : ∀ l (k : F.Key l), ∃ x y : F.Input, x ≠ y ∧ F.H l k x = F.H l k y) :
    ¬ HashCRHardQuant F (fun _ => True) :=
  fun h => collisionResistant_false_of_compressing F hin hcol
    ((collisionResistant_iff_hashCRHardQuant_top F).mpr h)

/-- **(TOOTH — the OTHER pole: `Eff := ⊥` is vacuous.)** At the empty class the floor holds for ANY family,
including a broken one. Recorded HONESTLY: a satisfiability witness is worth nothing without the refutation
beside it, and the two poles together are what make `Eff` a dial, not a costume. -/
theorem hermine_binding_eff_bot_vacuous {F : KeyedHashFamily} :
    HashCRHardQuant F (fun _ => False) :=
  hard_bot_vacuous _

/-- **(CANARY — the keystone does NOT follow from the floor applied at another adversary.)** Strip the
reduction — try to conclude the opener's negligibility from the floor applied at some OTHER adversary
`B`, NOT the one extracted from it — and the proof does not go through: `hD B hB` bounds the game
advantage of `B`, a DIFFERENT ensemble, and only `open_adv_le` connects the extracted finder to the
opening game. ⚑ Against the DELETED `_eff` export this tooth was unwritable, because hypothesis and
conclusion were the same object. -/

  fail_if_success
    (have : Negl (gameAdv (commitOpenGame F) A) := hD B hB)

/-- **THE POSITIVE POLE — the RIGHT floor DOES discharge it.** With the floor at the EXTRACTED finder the
keystone fires. A gate that refuses everything is a broken keystone, not a fixed one. -/

/-! ## §3 — the concurrent forger, as a first-class λ-indexed game.

A concurrent rushing forger is a validator that opens a common commitment `cm` and hands back two
accepting SelfTargetMSIS solutions with `c ≠ c'`. This section makes that adversary a `Game`, played over
a SAMPLED instance, exactly as `VrfRegrounded.vrfUniqGame` makes a uniqueness-breaker one. The two games
the reduction attacks — the MSIS game of the augmented map, and the commit-collision game — are derived
from the SAME family, so all three share an instance space and the union bound below is over one `Ω`. -/

commit map `commit : N → C` (`= cr.H i`, the commit-reveal at its fixed index), and the target commitment
`cmt = cm` that both reveals must open. `β` is the shortness bound. This carries the deployed data of the

it. The probability-level lift of a two-horned dichotomy (`winProb_le_of_imp` is its one-horned sibling). -/

/-- **⚑ RE-GROUNDED HERMINE CONCURRENT-FORGERY BOUND — from MSIS hardness AND commit-collision resistance,
VIA the reduction.**

Under the MSIS floor at the augmented family the reduction attacks AND the collision floor at the commit
map, a concurrent forger whose extracted solver and finder are in the floors' adversary classes has
NEGLIGIBLE advantage: a rushing validator double-claims only with negligible probability. The Boolean
dichotomy `¬HashCR ∨ MSIS-solution` becomes the additive negligible advantage — and, unlike its
predecessor, this statement is FALSE if you delete the reduction: the conclusion is about the forgery
game, the hypotheses about the MSIS and collision games, and `forgery_adv_le` is the only bridge.

⚑ **THE `hEff`/`hEffH` OBLIGATIONS ARE UNDISCHARGED AND THAT IS THE HONEST STATE.** They say the extracted
solver/finder are in the classes the floors quantify over — the standard "the reduction is efficient".
They are PARAMETERS here, in the open, at the use site, because this tree has no cost model
(`FloorGames` §8). Both floors are priced exactly by §6: `⊤` makes them FALSE at compressing parameters,
`⊥` vacuous. -/

/-! ## §5 — the CANARY: break the reduction and the keystone goes RED.

The sweep's lesson is that a floor consumer must be checked by asking whether it survives the WRONG
hypothesis. Under the OLD statement — `(adv) (s) (hmsis : MSISHardQuantShape adv) : Negl (… + adv s n)` —
the MSIS leg was `hmsis s`, so a canary that conclude negligibility from a floor applied at some OTHER
solver was unwritable: hypothesis and conclusion mentioned the same free `adv s`. Here they cannot. -/

/-- **(CANARY — the keystone does NOT follow from the floors applied at OTHER adversaries.)** Strip the
reduction — try to conclude the forger's negligibility from the MSIS and collision floors applied at some
OTHER solver `B` and finder `E`, NOT the ones extracted from the forger — and the proof does not go
through: the floors bound `B` and `E`, and only `forgery_adv_le` connects the EXTRACTED pair to the
forgery game. `negl_add (hmsis B hB) (hcol E hE)` proves `Negl` of the WRONG advantage sum, so it cannot
close `Negl (gameAdv (concurrentForgeryGame F) A)`. This tooth was impossible to write under the old free
hypothesis; it compiles now, and reds if a future edit reconnects the games. -/

/-- **THE POSITIVE POLE — the RIGHT floors DO discharge it.** A gate that refuses everything is a broken
keystone, not a fixed one. With the MSIS floor at the augmented game and the collision floor at the commit
map — both at the EXTRACTED adversaries — the keystone fires and concludes negligibility of the forger's
advantage. Refusal is discrimination only if acceptance still happens. -/

refutation beside it. -/

The real content: if a short nonzero kernel vector of `[A | t]` exists at every sampled instance — which
pigeonhole forces at deployed parameters, and which is WHY MSIS is a hard search problem — then the floor
at `Eff := ⊤` is FALSE, and the keystone is vacuous there. This is the price of `hEff`, stated as a
