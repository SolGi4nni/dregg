# `Dregg2.Crypto.HermineRomBinding` — the Hermine COMMIT-REVEAL binding, RE-GROUNDED on the KEYED,
QUERY-COUNTED random-oracle floor (the PROVED floor), and the concurrent rushing composition with its
equivocation horn DISCHARGED there.

## What this replaces (the D-class drop)

`HermineHintMLWE.commitment_binding` and `HermineHintMLWE.concurrent_unforgeable_reduces` carried
`hcr : HashCR cr` — pure INJECTIVITY of the commit map, PROVED FALSE for every compressing
commit-reveal by `HashFloorHonesty.hashCR_false_of_compressing`. Both are DELETED (same commit as this
file). Their content survives as:

  * the deterministic extractor `HermineHintMLWE.equivocation_breaks_hashcr` (an equivocated opening
    IS a collision — a `¬ HashCR` conclusion, retained ONLY as the reduction's witness, never
    re-exported as a floor);
  * the rushing dichotomy `HermineHintMLWE.concurrent_forgery_breaks_hashcr_or_msis` (no floor
    hypothesis — the case split itself);
  * the probabilistic keystone `HermineHashCRRegrounded.hermine_concurrent_forgery_advantage_bound`
    (both horns' floors PARAMETRIC); and
  * **THIS FILE**: the binding and the equivocation horn discharged on `KeyedRomFloor.keyedRom_hard`
    — the birthday bound, a THEOREM, with the counterexample (a hardcoded collision answerer)
    ADMITTED and DEFANGED rather than assumed away.

Why a separate module and not a §8 of `HermineHashCRRegrounded`: `Crypto.RomCarrierSites` (the per-site
keyed-ROM kit) already IMPORTS `HermineHashCRRegrounded` (for `winProb_le_add_of_imp`), so the ROM
successors cannot live there without an import cycle.

## ⚑ The modelling step, stated (not smuggled)

Exactly `RomCarrierSites`' header: the deployed commit hash `cmᵢ = H(i, wᵢ)` is idealised as ONE
SAMPLED keyed oracle `H : Idx × W → Fin (2 ^ l)` — the standard ROM idealisation of the
domain-separated hash at an ASYMPTOTIC digest width, a deliberate labelled modelling step, NOT a
derivation about the fixed deployed function. What it buys: the floor under the binding is
`keyedRom_hard` (PROVED) where the deleted export carried a hypothesis that is FALSE. What it does not
buy: any statement about the fixed public hash itself.

## Non-fake

The `shortCollAdv` shape — a `0`-query answerer with a hardcoded "collision" — is IN the class
(`constTriple_in_eff`), wins with POSITIVE probability (`crRom_class_inhabited_pos`), and its
advantage is NEGLIGIBLE (`crRom_constAnswer_defanged`): the counterexample DIES under keying instead
of being excluded by fiat. A non-negligible equivocator is OUTSIDE the class
(`crRom_nonNegl_forger_excluded`). The §5 canary proves the floor at ANOTHER adversary does not close
the bound. `#assert_all_clean` ⊆ {propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}; no `sorry`, no `axiom`, no
`native_decide`.

The deployed commitment is `cmᵢ = H(i, wᵢ)`: the signer index `i` is the domain-separation tag (the
KEY coordinate of the sampled oracle) and the reveal `w` is the absorbed message. The carrier's
per-site content — the encoding and its payload-injectivity — is trivial here because the absorbed
message IS the reveal. -/

`HermineHashCRRegrounded` §3–§4 already makes the rushing forger a first-class `Game`
(`concurrentForgeryGame`) and proves the union-bound keystone
`hermine_concurrent_forgery_advantage_bound` with BOTH horns' floors parametric. Here the family is
INSTANTIATED at the sampled keyed oracle — the instance space IS the oracle space, the commit map IS
the oracle — and the equivocation horn's floor `Hard (cfEquivGame _) _` is PROVED from
`keyedRom_hard`. The MSIS horn stays at the honest adversary-quantified `MSISHardQuant` (the lattice
floor is not this campaign's; the Boolean `MSISHard` the deleted export carried is itself an
existence-refutation, `Lattice.MSISHard`'s own docstring). -/
