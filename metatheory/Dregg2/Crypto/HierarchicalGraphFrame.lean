⚠ ADVERSARIAL VERIFY: **THE JOIN IS NOW SUPPLIED (§2b); READ WHAT IT DOES AND DOES NOT BUY.**

The previous state of this file was two halves that never met:

* §1 (`frame_of_absorbInjective`, `afterGraph_eq_replaceSlot`) IS over the real `AncestorUpdate.check`
  and the real `semanticRoot` — but it is conditional on `TreeAbsorbInjective`, and THIS FILE ITSELF
  REFUTES that hypothesis for every bounded-lane digest (`not_treeAbsorbInjective_of_boundedLanes`,
  a pinned keystone). §1's price is ZERO and §1 is UNCHANGED: it stays a statement about the LAYOUT.
* §2 (`frame_binds_rom`) has no such assumption — but its objects (`romRootFromPath`, `hgcRomRoot`,
  `GraphSlots`, `romPathFor`) were hand-written ROM ANALOGUES with no lemma anywhere in `Dregg2/`
  relating them to `rootFromPath` / `pathFor` / `semanticRoot` / `AncestorUpdate`.

**§2b closes that gap**, in the shape the sibling `HierarchicalGraphCommitment.lean` uses for its own
game (`hgcRom_graph_forgery_is_break`). `romHash l H : Hash` instantiates the DEPLOYED `Hash` interface
with the sampled role-keyed oracle (tag dispatch + round-tripping decoders), and the three named-missing
bridges are proved — `romHash_semanticRoot` (hgcRomRoot ↔ semanticRoot), `romHash_pathFor` (romPathFor ↔
pathFor), `romHash_rootFromPath` (romRootFromPath ↔ rootFromPath, for an ARBITRARY adversarial path).
`frame_object_break_is_win` then turns an accepted-but-non-framing deployed `AncestorUpdate` into a
CONCRETE `frameForgery` win, and `objFrame_binds_rom` prices it: every query-bounded adversary producing
an accepted `AncestorUpdate` whose committed graphs violate the frame conclusion has NEGLIGIBLE
advantage — NO `TreeAbsorbInjective`, NO floor hypothesis, NO `∨ ∃ collision`.
`objFrame_constAnswer_defanged` exhibits an oracle where the deployed check ACCEPTS while the frame
fails, so the priced event is nonempty and the statement is not satisfied by "the check never accepts".

⚠ WHAT REMAINS OPEN, PRECISELY. (a) `romHash l H` is the SAMPLED oracle wearing the deployed `Hash`
type, not Poseidon2 — the `RomCarrierSites` modelling step is inherited verbatim and is now visible at
the `Hash` interface itself; nothing is claimed about the fixed public digest. (b) the eight-lane digest
is collapsed to ONE `λ`-growing lane on BOTH sides — `embedDig` writes lane 0 and `toRomDig` reads lane
0 — so the deployed ~31-bit felt width is NOT modelled, and the modelled hash is strictly WEAKER than
the deployed one on lanes 1-7 (a forger may vary them freely). The converse is proved against that
weaker object, which is the conservative direction, but it is not the deployed eight-lane digest.
(c) §1's hypothesis is still refuted and §1
is still priced at zero — §2b does not rescue it, it replaces its role. (d) `GRAPH_SLOTS = 4` throughout;
§3's counts are instances, not a theorem over `n`. (e) Nothing here touches the deployed AIR, which
still absorbs the whole graph core every step.

⚑ WHAT THE BRIDGE NEEDED FROM THE TREE, AND FOUND: (i) the three absorb shapes distinguishable from the
limb list — the distinct `LEAF_TAG`/`PAIR_TAG`/`ROOT_TAG` heads give this; (ii) the leaf message to
carry its POSITION and the node message its CHILD ORDER — `leafInputs`/`nodeInputs` already do. NO
missing structural property: no per-position tag and no extra domain separation had to be added, which
matches §1's own finding that the obstruction was entirely the hash, never the layout.
# Dregg2.Crypto.HierarchicalGraphFrame — ⚑ THE FRAME CONVERSE of the hierarchical graph commitment.

`Crypto.HierarchicalGraphCommitment` builds the depth-two domain-separated tree over the four
deployed graph slots and proves, for every opening it defines, exactly ONE direction:

    (honest opening).check … = true      (`openLeaf_checks`, `openInterface_checks`,
                                          `openRedex2_checks`, `updateLeaf_checks`)

That is COMPLETENESS.  The theorem the hypergraph VM actually needs is the CONVERSE, and it is the
FRAME theorem:

    an ACCEPTED `AncestorUpdate` at index `u` forces the committed graph to change ONLY at `u`
    — and to change there EXACTLY to the authenticated slot.

Without it, `AncestorUpdate.check` is a check that authenticates one path and says nothing about the
other slots, so a step is only sound if the AIR re-hashes the WHOLE graph — which is exactly what
the deployed `privateGraphRewriteDescriptor` does (`GRAPH_SLOTS := 4`, a Θ(|G|) absorb every step,
112 of its 310 columns permutation staging).  The frame problem there is AVOIDED by smallness, not
solved.  This file proves the converse, at two resolutions, and states what it buys.

## §1 — the PURE STRUCTURAL core, and the named hypothesis it needs

`frame_of_absorbInjective`: if the deployed digest is injective on the three absorb SHAPES the tree
feeds it (`TreeAbsorbInjective`), then an accepted update at `u` gives

    g_before.slots u = update.before   ∧   g_after.slots = Function.update g_before.slots u update.after

— the full frame plus exactness, with NO hypothesis about the semantics and NO escape branch.

⚑ WHAT THE TREE NEEDS, PRECISELY, AND WHAT IT ALREADY HAS.  The converse needs a POSITIONAL binding:
a leaf digest must not be re-usable at another position, and a node digest must not be re-usable with
its children swapped.  The tree HAS both, and the proof shows where: the leaf absorb carries the slot
INDEX (`leafInputs index slot`, `leafInputs_injective` at a FIXED index), and the node absorb carries
its two children IN ORDER (`nodeInputs_injective` as a map out of `Digest8 × Digest8`).  Nothing else
is needed — in particular the peel never compares a LEAF absorb with a PAIR absorb or a PAIR with the
ROOT, so the `LEAF_TAG`/`PAIR_TAG`/`ROOT_TAG` domain separation is NOT what makes the frame work
(it is doing other work: keeping the memo/occurrence layers apart).  There is no missing structural
injectivity: the obstruction to the converse is ENTIRELY the hash, not the layout.

⚠ `TreeAbsorbInjective` is an ASSUMPTION, and at the deployed sponge it is FALSE — the node absorb is
17 limbs wide and the digest is 8 bounded lanes, so `not_treeAbsorbInjective_of_boundedLanes` REFUTES
it for every bounded-lane digest (no pigeonhole hand-waving: an infinite family of node absorbs into a
finite lane space).  So §1 is a statement about the LAYOUT, priced at zero, and it is NOT the deployed
statement.  It is also not vacuous: `exists_treeAbsorbInjective` exhibits a hash satisfying it.

## §2 — the DEPLOYED-RESOLUTION converse: a reduction on the SAME keyed-ROM floor

The exported frame converse is `frame_binds_rom`, in the shape `semanticRoot_binds_rom` already uses,
and for the reason its header records: the old `GraphRewriteHistory` / `HierarchicalGraphCommitment`
`_or_collision` disjunctions were DELETED because `∃ collision` is UNCONDITIONALLY TRUE at a
compressing root, so a `binds ∨ ∃ collision` theorem is satisfiable through the escape branch with the
binding never holding.  This file therefore ships NO such disjunction.  Instead:

  * `frameForgery` is a first-class `RomForgery hgcRomFamily`: the adversary outputs an index, a
    before/after slot, a PATH, and the two graph payloads its two roots commit to; it WINS iff both
    reconstructions check at the sampled role-keyed oracle AND the after-graph is NOT the before-graph
    with slot `u` replaced (the EXACTNESS break — strictly stronger than a frame violation, and
    `frame_violation_wins` proves a frame violation is one of these);
  * `frameExtractComp` is the extractor as an ORACLE PROGRAM: run the forger, then re-walk the path
    layer (8 queries) and both trees (12 queries), and `frameSelect` names the shallowest layer that
    equivocates — a `bindComp`, so the budget is ADDITIVE (`Q + 20`), never answer size;
  * `frame_binds_rom` closes from `romCarrier_binds` (hence `keyedRom_hard`, the birthday bound — a
    THEOREM).  NO floor hypothesis, NO escape branch.

The peel is: the ROOT absorb of the path differs from the before-graph's (a root-role equivocation),
or it agrees and the PAIR absorb differs (a pair-role equivocation through the shared root digest),
or both agree — in which case the path IS the before-graph's honest path, so the after-root commits to
`before-graph with slot u replaced` (`romRootFromPath_honest`), and disagreeing with the after-graph
payload is a root equivocation between two DISTINCT graphs, killed by the tree-walk of
`hgcSelect_wins` (the standalone form of `semanticRoot_binds_rom`'s own extractor argument).

⚑ THE MODELLING STEP IS INHERITED, NOT NEW: the sampled `H : Role × Msg → Fin (2 ^ l)` idealises the
fixed deployed eight-lane digest at an asymptotic width (`RomCarrierSites` header).  Nothing is
claimed about the fixed public hash.

## §2b — the ROM↔OBJECT BRIDGE: §2's price, landed on §1's objects

`romHash l H : Hash` answers a deployed limb list by dispatching on its absorbed tag onto the matching
role of `hgcRomFamily` and returning the oracle's `Fin (2 ^ l)` in lane 0.  It IS a `Hash`, so every
deployed definition applies to it unchanged, and the decoders round-trip the tree's own encodings.
Three bridges follow (`romHash_leafDigest` / `romHash_pairDigest` / `romHash_rootDigest`), then the
three the converse needs: `romHash_semanticRoot`, `romHash_pathFor`, `romHash_rootFromPath` (the last
for an ARBITRARY offered path — the forger's path is never assumed honest).

`frame_object_break_is_win` is the join, mirroring `hgcRom_graph_forgery_is_break`: an accepted
`AncestorUpdate` at the modelled hash whose authenticated before-slot is not the committed one, OR whose
after-graph is not the before-graph with that one slot replaced, IS a win of `frameForgery`.  Both
failure modes are covered by ONE game — a wrong before-slot is caught by re-presenting the before-graph
against itself, which is already an exactness break.  `objFrameGame` states the break entirely in
deployed objects (two `BoundedGraph`s and an `AncestorUpdate`), `objFrameToRom` extracts at ZERO extra
queries (pure post-processing), and `objFrame_binds_rom` closes on the same proved keyed-ROM floor.

## §3 — what the converse BUYS: Θ(|G|) absorbs → depth+1 absorbs, as a proposition

`update_rehashes_only_ancestor_path`: the root of the updated graph is the digest of the LAST of
`updateAbsorbs`, a THREE-block list determined by `(u, new slot, the two path digests)` alone;
`afterRoot_depends_only_on_path`: two graphs with the same path at `u` produce the same updated root,
so the update reads the rest of the graph NOT AT ALL.  Counted against the full recompute:
`(updateAbsorbs …).length = 3` with `2 ^ (3 - 1) = GRAPH_SLOTS` (depth + 1) versus
`(semanticRootAbsorbs …).length = 7 = 2 * GRAPH_SLOTS - 1`.  `single_slot_step_logarithmic_update`
puts the two together on a REAL rewrite step: a `BoundedOneStep` that touches only slot `u` is a
`RewriteStep` whose committed endpoints are joined by ONE accepted `AncestorUpdate` costing three
absorbs instead of seven.

⚠ HONEST SCOPE.  This is `GRAPH_SLOTS = 4`: `3 = log₂ 4 + 1` and `7 = 2·4 − 1` are INSTANCES of the
depth-vs-size counts, not a theorem over `n`.  The general Θ(log n) statement needs a depth-parametric
tree, which this prototype does not have — that generalisation, and the two-slot (redex-2) composition
where the two updates share a pair node, are named residuals, not claims.  Nothing here touches the
deployed AIR: `privateGraphRewriteDescriptor` still absorbs the whole graph core, so the frame converse
is the PREREQUISITE for shrinking it, not a measurement of a shrunken circuit.

/-- **THE LAYOUT HYPOTHESIS THE FRAME CONVERSE NEEDS.** The digest is injective on the leaf absorbs
at a fixed slot index, and on the node absorbs at a fixed tag (jointly in both children).

⚠ This is an ASSUMPTION about the deployed digest, and `not_treeAbsorbInjective_of_boundedLanes`
proves it FALSE for every bounded-lane digest — the deployed statement is §2's reduction.  What it
isolates is the LAYOUT's contribution: given absorb injectivity, the tree frames with no further

child ORDER pins which side of the pair `u` sits on and the leaf INDEX pins which leaf it is. -/

/-- **⚑⚑ THE FRAME CONVERSE, DISCHARGED ON THE PROVED KEYED-ROM FLOOR.**

Every query-bounded forger that produces an ACCEPTED ancestor update whose after-graph is NOT the
before-graph with the authenticated slot replaced has NEGLIGIBLE advantage.  Equivalently: except with
negligible probability, an accepted `AncestorUpdate` at index `u` changes the committed graph ONLY at
`u`, and there exactly to the authenticated slot.  This is the theorem `updateLeaf_checks` was missing,
and it is what lets a step re-hash the ancestor path instead of the whole graph.

NO floor hypothesis, NO escape branch: the peel produces a CONCRETE equivocation of the tree's single
carrier at a NAMED role, and `romCarrier_binds` (hence `keyedRom_hard`, the birthday bound) kills it. -/

/-! ### §2b — ⚑⚑ THE ROM↔OBJECT BRIDGE: §2's price lands on §1's DEPLOYED objects.

Everything above §2b has the defect the header records: §1 is over the real `AncestorUpdate.check` but
under a hypothesis this file itself refutes, and §2 is unconditional but over hand-written ROM
ANALOGUES.  This section supplies the join, in the shape `HierarchicalGraphCommitment` uses for its own
game (`hgcRom_graph_forgery_is_break`): an INSTANTIATION of the deployed `Hash` interface by the sampled
role-keyed oracle, four correspondence lemmas, and then the object-level statement.

* `romHash l H : Hash` answers a deployed limb list by DISPATCHING on the absorbed tag —
  `LEAF_TAG` → the leaf role at `(index, slot)`, `PAIR_TAG`/`ROOT_TAG` → the pair/root role at the two
  child digests — and returns the oracle's `Fin (2 ^ l)` answer in lane 0.  The dispatch is total and the
  decoders (`decIndex`, `decSlot`, `decLeft`, `decRight`) round-trip the tree's OWN encodings, because
  `leafInputs` carries the index and `nodeInputs` carries its children in order.  ⚑ NOTHING STRUCTURAL IS
  MISSING: the bridge needs exactly (i) the three absorb shapes distinguishable from the limb list — the
  three distinct head tags give this — and (ii) the leaf message to carry its position and the node
  message its child order — `leafInputs`/`nodeInputs` already do.  No per-position tag, no extra domain
  separation had to be added.
* `romHash_leafDigest` / `romHash_pairDigest` / `romHash_rootDigest` are the three layer bridges, and
  `romHash_semanticRoot` (⟷ `hgcRomRoot`), `romHash_pathFor` (⟷ `romPathFor`) and
  `romHash_rootFromPath` (⟷ `romRootFromPath`) are the three the header named as missing.  The path
  bridge holds for an ARBITRARY adversarial `Path4`, not just honest ones.
* `frame_object_break_is_win` is the join: an ACCEPTED `AncestorUpdate` at the modelled hash whose
  before-slot is wrong, OR whose after-graph is not the before-graph with that one slot replaced, IS a
  concrete win of `frameForgery` — so `frame_binds_rom` prices it.  `objFrame_binds_rom` states that
  with no `TreeAbsorbInjective`, no escape branch, and no `∃ collision`: the escape is a GAME WIN whose
  probability the birthday floor bounds, and `objFrame_constAnswer_defanged` exhibits an instance where
  that win actually happens, so the price is nonzero.

⚠ WHAT IS STILL NOT CLOSED.  `romHash l H` is the sampled oracle wearing the deployed `Hash` interface,
not Poseidon2: the modelling step of `RomCarrierSites` is INHERITED here verbatim and is now visible at
the `Hash` type itself.  Two consequences worth saying out loud: (a) nothing is claimed about the fixed
public digest — CR of a fixed function is a conjecture, not a theorem; (b) `embedDig` puts the whole
`λ`-bit answer in ONE lane, so the eight-lane deployed digest is idealised as a single `λ`-growing value
and the ~31-bit felt width of the real lanes is NOT modelled.  §1's `TreeAbsorbInjective` remains
refuted and §1 remains a layout statement; the deployed AIR still absorbs the whole graph core. -/
