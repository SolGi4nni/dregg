# `Dregg2.Crypto.IdentityCommitmentRegrounded` — the DEPLOYED hybrid-identity-commitment binding
RE-GROUNDED off the VACUOUS injective `HashCR` floor onto the PROPER keyed `CollisionResistant` floor.

## The gap this closes (the id-re-basing leg of the 07-13 floor sweep)

`IdentityCommitment.id_commitment_binds` is the soundness floor UNDER THE DEPLOYED id re-basing
(`types/src/lib.rs::hybrid_id_commitment`; the `cell-crypto` / `captp` / `wire` `verify_committed_ml_dsa`
gate). It concludes "one id determines its `(ed25519, ml_dsa)` pair uniquely", conditioned on
`HermineHintMLWE.HashCR cr` — the SAME injective floor `HashFloorHonesty.hashCR_false_of_compressing`
PROVES FALSE for any compressing commitment. `hybrid_id_commitment = BLAKE3_derive_key(tag, ed ‖ len(ml) ‖ ml)`
maps a long framed preimage to a fixed-width id, so it IS compressing — the deployed gate's binding lemma
is VACUOUSLY TRUE at real parameters.

`HermineHashCRRegrounded` landed the generic commit-reveal regrounding (`commitRevealFamily`,
`hermine_commitment_binding_advantage_bound`) and its prose names IdentityCommitment as a "DEPLOYED-reachable
reuse" — but no theorem instantiates it for the id-commitment gate's own `cr`. This file wires that: it moves
the deployed gate onto the proper floor, so the id re-basing no longer rides an empty hypothesis.

## The re-grounding

* **`idCommitFamily cr`** — the deployed id-commit hash `H(())` over framed preimages, as the keyed hash
  family `commitRevealFamily cr ()` the honest collision game runs over.
* **`id_commitment_binds_advantage_bound`** — the advantage-bounded sibling of `id_commitment_binds`: an
  enrollment-equivocation adversary (two DISTINCT key pairs — hence two distinct length-framed preimages,
  by `IdentityCommitment.commit_collision_is_hash_collision` — colliding to one id) IS a `CollisionFinder`,
  so under the proper `CollisionResistant (idCommitFamily cr)` floor its advantage is `Negl`. "one id ⟹ one
  key pair" becomes "one id ⟹ one key pair EXCEPT with negligible probability" — a self-carried PQ key
  cannot impersonate the enrolled one except with negligible advantage. Discharged by
  `thread_advantage_bound` (the single `CollisionResistant` leaf), reusing the generic keystone.

## Non-fake

The floor is SATISFIABLE (`idCommit_exCR_CR`: the injective `IdentityCommitment.exCR` discharges it) and
LOAD-BEARING (`idCommit_badCR_not_CR`: the COLLIDING `IdentityCommitment.badCR` has an equivocator winning
on every key, advantage `1`, so its family is NOT CR — mirrors `IdentityCommitment.binding_needs_hashcr`).
The old injective-floor consumers are KEPT untouched; this file only ADDS the sibling. `#assert_all_clean`
(⊆ {propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}); no `sorry`, no fresh `axiom`.

## Coordination

This is the id-re-basing commit-reveal leg. The generic template + the concurrent-forgery composition are
`HermineHashCRRegrounded`; the STARK/FRI/Merkle hash consumers are `Circuit.FloorRegroundedConsumers`; the
`MSISHard`/DL Boolean crypto floors are `FloorBridge`/`CryptoFloorTeeth`. It stays in the
`IdentityCommitment` subtree — no consumer moved here lives elsewhere.

/-- **THE ID-COMMITMENT KEYED FAMILY.** The deployed hybrid-identity commit hash `cr.H ()` over the
length-framed preimages, as a `KeyedHashFamily` (`commitRevealFamily cr ()`). This is the keyed hash the
proper collision game runs over — the honest floor object the id re-basing actually needs. -/

/-! ## §2 — the ENROLLMENT EQUIVOCATION, as a SECURITY REDUCTION on the DEPLOYED gate.

⚑ **WHAT THIS SECTION USED TO EXPORT, AND WHY IT IS GONE.** `id_commitment_binds_advantage_bound` took
`hCR : CollisionResistant (idCommitFamily cr)`. `FloorGames.collisionResistant_iff_hashCRHardQuant_top`
proves that IS the collision floor at the UNRESTRICTED class, and `collisionResistant_false_of_compressing`
proves THAT false for any compressing hash — including the deployed
`BLAKE3(tag, ed ‖ len(ml) ‖ ml)`. So the exported binding rested on a hypothesis REFUTED at deployed
parameters. Its `_eff` sibling took a `CollisionFinder` and applied the floor TO IT, so the ENROLLMENT
never appeared in a `Prop` at all. BOTH ARE DELETED.

What stands here is stronger than a generic instantiation: the break game is stated on the DEPLOYED
enrollment gate `IdentityCommitment.verify_committed` — the Rust `==` check — so the adversary's win is
literally "two DISTINCT `(ed25519, ml_dsa)` pairs both pass the gate against one enrolled id". The
extractor is the LENGTH FRAMING, and `hframe`'s contrapositive is what makes the two framed pre-images
distinct: that is the step `IdentityCommitment.id_commitment_binds` spends its (false) `HashCR` on. -/

/-- **THE ENROLLMENT-EQUIVOCATION GAME.** The adversary is handed a sampled key and WINS iff it publishes
an identity together with TWO key pairs that BOTH pass the deployed enrollment gate
(`verify_committed`, i.e. `commit cr frame ed ml = id`) while DIFFERING. A win is exactly the
impersonation `IdentityCommitment.attacker_key_not_committed` denies: a self-carried PQ key that the
enrolled id accepts. The deployed gate is IN the win relation. -/

/-- **THE EXTRACTOR, AS A MAP OF ADVERSARIES.** An enrollment equivocator becomes a hash-collision finder

they are DISTINCT because `hframe` is injective in both arguments and the pairs differ, and their hashes
are EQUAL because both equal the published id. The `∃`-form of this fact is unconditionally TRUE at
deployed parameters by pigeonhole and so binds nothing; a MAP OF ADVERSARIES lands in a game advantage,
which a floor can bind. -/

/-- **⚑ RE-GROUNDED `IdentityCommitment.id_commitment_binds` — from the id-commit hash's collision floor,
VIA the reduction.** Under the collision floor at the class `Eff`, an enrollment equivocator whose
extracted finder is in that class has NEGLIGIBLE advantage: an id determines its `(ed25519, ml_dsa)` pair
EXCEPT with negligible probability, so a self-carried PQ key cannot impersonate the enrolled one except
with that advantage. The Boolean "one id ⟹ one key pair", which needed the FALSE injective `HashCR`,
becomes an honest advantage bound.

`Eff` is a parameter here because this is the statement at an ARBITRARY class; the DISCHARGED
instantiation is §2R's keyed-ROM binding (the `IsPolyTime` discharge that stood here is DELETED —
its floor is refuted at deployed parameters, see §2R's header). -/

/-! ## §2R — ⚑⚑ THE DISCHARGED SUCCESSOR: the enrollment binding on the PROVED keyed-ROM floor.

⚑ **WHAT WAS DELETED HERE, AND WHY.** `id_commitment_binds_from_polyTime` discharged `Eff` at
`CostAdversary.IsPolyTime`, whose floor `HashCRHardQuant … (IsPolyTime …)` is REFUTED at deployed
parameters (`Exec.SystemRootsBindingReduction.sysRoots_floor_polyTime_false_babyBear`: `IsPolyTime`
prices answer SIZE, so a `.pure` answerer with a hardcoded short collision is in the class and wins
with probability `1`). DELETED, and replaced by the keyed-ROM successor below.

⚑ **THE MODELLING STEP, STATED (not smuggled).** The deployed id-commit hash
`BLAKE3_derive_key(tag, ed ‖ len(ml) ‖ ml)` is idealised as ONE SAMPLED oracle
`H : Unit × Pre → Fin (2 ^ l)` over the (finite, truncated-deployed-shape) framed pre-image space —
the standard ROM idealisation at an ASYMPTOTIC id width, a deliberate labelled modelling step, NOT a
derivation about the fixed public function. What it buys: the floor under the binding is
`KeyedRomFloor.keyedRom_hard` (the birthday bound, PROVED). The break keeps §2's shape: the PUBLISHED
id is in the win relation, the LENGTH FRAMING is the carrier's encoding, and `hframe` — the structural
injectivity the deployed framing genuinely satisfies — is the ONLY per-site obligation. -/
