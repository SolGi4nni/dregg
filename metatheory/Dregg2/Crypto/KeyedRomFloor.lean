# `Dregg2.Crypto.KeyedRomFloor` — the KEYED, QUERY-COUNTED collision floor, and the death of the
counterexample that refutes the `IsPolyTime` floor.

## The bug this file answers (proved in-tree, `Exec.SystemRootsBindingReduction` §6)

`sysRoots_floor_polyTime_false_babyBear` proves

    ¬ HashCRHardQuant (spongeFamily D) (IsPolyTime (spongeAnsSize D))

i.e. the deployed sponge's collision floor, at the `CostAdversary.IsPolyTime` class, is **FALSE** at
deployed BabyBear parameters. The refutation is the same disease as ArkLib's `KZG.binding`
(`docs/reference/ARKLIB-KZG-VACUITY.md`): `IsPolyTime sz A` reduces to *poly-SIZE answers*
(`CostAdversary.isPolyTime_of_polySize_answers`), because `idAdv` embeds ANY Lean function — a
`Classical.choice` one included — as `.pure (a₀ l i)`, whose whole cost is `sz (a₀ l i)`. So the
`shortCollAdv` that answers each sampled tag with a TWO-LIMB collision (which EXISTS, by pigeonhole,
in the fixed compressing sponge) is in the class and wins with probability `1`. `IsPolyTime` prices
the answer's *size*, never the *difficulty of finding it*, so it cannot separate "writes a short
string" from "finds a collision". Every `_from_polyTime` reduction on the spine inherits this: their
floor hypothesis is refutable, hence they are VACUOUS at deployed parameters.

## The two load-bearing fixes (both required — the counterexample needs both), and where they already live

`Crypto.RomQueryFloor` already carries BOTH, for a random oracle:

  1. **The hash is an ORACLE the adversary QUERIES, cost is QUERY-COUNTED.** `RomOracle.OracleComp` is
     a decision tree that branches only on answers it *asked for*; `QueryBounded Q M` bounds the calls
     along every path; `RomEff F Q` is the class of raw adversaries that FACTOR THROUGH such a tree.
     The collision is not a `.pure` value handed back — it must be found through `query` nodes.
  2. **KEYED — the key/oracle sampled AFTER the adversary is fixed.** In `romCollisionGame F` the
     *instance* is the sampled oracle `H`; `RomEff`'s tree `M` is fixed BEFORE `H`. A `Classical.choice`
     answerer would have to know a collision of `H` without querying it — and
     `RomOracle.OracleComp.eval_congr_of_agree_on_queried` proves an oracle program's output is a
     function of the answers it *received* and of nothing else. So it cannot bake a collision in.

`RomQueryFloor.choiceAdv_not_romEff` PROVES the collision-answerer is excluded; `romCollision_hard`
PROVES the floor (the birthday bound, no assumption under it); `binaryRom_verdict` prices both poles.

## What THIS file adds

The deployed floor is over a KEYED family (`spongeFamily D` is keyed by its domain-separation tag).
This file gives the keyed presentation of `RomQueryFloor` — the collision game over the tag-separated
domain `Key × Input` — and, crucially, the two theorems that are the ACCEPTANCE TEST for the fix:

  * **§3 (a) THE FULL-ORACLE CHOICE ANSWERER IS EXCLUDED.** `not_keyedRomEff_of_not_negl`: any
    adversary whose advantage is not negligible is outside `KeyedRomEff`. Applied to the
    `Classical.choice` answerer (advantage `1` at a compressing family), it is EXCLUDED — the direct
    analogue of `shortCollAdv`'s exclusion. The refutation strategy of
    `sysRoots_floor_polyTime_false_babyBear` cannot produce a member of the fixed class.
  * **§3 (b) THE FIXED SHORT-COLLISION ANSWERER IS DEFANGED.** The sharper mirror. The *exact* shape
    that refutes the `IsPolyTime` floor — a `.pure` leaf answering with a FIXED short collision — IS
    admitted by `KeyedRomEff` (it is a `0`-query tree), but over the SAMPLED oracle a fixed pair
    collides with probability only `1/|R|` (`fixedPairAdv_gameAdv_eq`), which is NEGLIGIBLE
    (`fixedPairAdv_negl`). So the adversary that wins with probability `1` against the *fixed* sponge
    wins only negligibly against the *sampled* oracle. Sampling the key after the adversary is exactly
    what collapses its advantage. It does NOT refute the keyed/query-counted floor.

Together these are the counterexample dying: neither the excluded full-oracle answerer nor the
admitted fixed answerer refutes the fixed floor, and §2's `keyedRom_hard` PROVES the floor holds.

## Both poles, at the fixed model (§4)

`keyedRom_top_false` — the UNRESTRICTED floor at the same keyed game is FALSE (compressing pigeonhole),
so `KeyedRomEff` is not `⊤` in disguise. `twoPointKeyed_in_keyedRomEff` + `twoPointKeyed_gameAdv_pos`
— a real two-query adversary is in the class and wins with positive advantage, so it is not `⊥`.

## Axiom hygiene

`#assert_all_clean` ⊆ {propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}; no `sorry`, no fresh `axiom`, no
`native_decide`. `Classical.choice` enters only via the excluded full-oracle answerer.

/-! ## §1 — the keyed family, its collision game, and the query-bounded class.

The keying is the standard keyed-from-unkeyed model, exactly as `SpongeCarrierReduction.SpongeKeyed`
uses it: an unkeyed fixed hash lets an adversary hardcode a known collision, so the collision game
must sample something. Here what is sampled is the ORACLE (the random-oracle idealization of the
deployed sponge), and the domain is the TAG-SEPARATED input space `Key × Input`, so a collision is
between two distinct tagged messages — the object the domain-separated sponge is supposed to bind. -/

/-- **A KEYED RANDOM-ORACLE FAMILY.** At each security parameter: a finite tag/key space, a finite
input domain, and a finite range. The idealized keyed hash is a uniformly sampled function on the
tag-separated domain `Key l × D l`. No hash function is named — in the random oracle model the sampled
function IS the object, and the tag is a coordinate of its domain (domain separation). -/
structure KeyedRomFamily where
  /-- The domain-separation tag/key space at parameter `l`. -/
  Key : ℕ → Type
  /-- The message domain at parameter `l` — what is absorbed after the tag. -/

/-- **THE KEYED FAMILY AS A PLAIN RANDOM-ORACLE FAMILY** — the tag folds into the domain. The oracle
is `H : (Key l × D l) → R l`, so a collision is between two DISTINCT tagged messages, which is exactly
domain-separated collision resistance of the sponge that absorbs `tagCode t ++ msg`. -/

def keyedRomGame (F : KeyedRomFamily) : Game := romCollisionGame F.toRomFamily

/-- **THE QUERY-BOUNDED KEYED ADVERSARY CLASS — the fixed `Eff`.** `A` factors through a `Q`-query
oracle tree over the tag-separated domain. It is a restriction on the SAME raw adversary type the
floor quantifies over, so it plugs into `FloorGames.Hard` unchanged, and the key/oracle it attacks is
sampled AFTER the tree is fixed. -/

/-- **⚑⚑ THE KEYED HASH FLOOR, PROVED.** At a `λ`-growing digest space (`|R l| = 2^l`, the deployed
shape) and a polynomially bounded query budget, EVERY query-bounded keyed adversary's collision
advantage is negligible. Directly `RomQueryFloor.romCollision_hard` at the tag-separated family: the
birthday bound, with NO cryptographic assumption under it. This is what replaces
`HashCRHardQuant (spongeFamily D) (IsPolyTime …)`, whose hypothesis is FALSE. -/

/-! ## §3 — ⚑ THE COUNTEREXAMPLE DIES.

The refutation `sysRoots_floor_polyTime_false_babyBear` builds `shortCollAdv`: an adversary answering
each sampled tag with a fixed two-limb collision that EXISTS in the fixed compressing sponge, hence
wins with probability `1`, hence refutes the `IsPolyTime` floor. This section proves that strategy no
longer refutes the keyed/query-counted floor — in the two complementary ways the fix works. -/

/-- **THE GENERAL EXCLUSION.** A keyed adversary whose advantage is NOT negligible is OUTSIDE
`KeyedRomEff`: if it were inside, `keyedRom_hard` would make its advantage negligible. This is the
form of the death of every `shortCollAdv`-style refuter — the class the floor quantifies over does not
contain the adversary the refutation needs. -/

whole sampled oracle and returns a collision wherever one exists — the `shortCollAdv` analogue in the
random oracle model — is NOT in `KeyedRomEff`. It would have to know a collision of an oracle it never
queried; `RomOracle.OracleComp.eval_congr_of_agree_on_queried` forbids that. Directly

oracle and returns a FIXED pair of distinct tagged messages `(x l, y l)`. As a `0`-query tree it is

  4. **THE COUNTEREXAMPLE DIES BOTH WAYS**: the fixed short-collision answerer (the `IsPolyTime`
     refuter's shape) is admitted but its advantage is negligible.

So the floor is not vacuous, the class is neither `⊤` nor `⊥`, and the `shortCollAdv`-style refutation
