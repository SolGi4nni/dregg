# `Dregg2.Crypto.KeyedRomHidingFloor` — the KEYED-ROM HIDING FLOOR, **PROVED**, by the same
lazy-sampling counting that already proves the birthday collision bound.

## What this file answers

Commitment HIDING in this tree had the same disease collision-resistance had before
`RomQueryFloor`: the only stated floor lived at a class with no content.
`Metatheory.Open.BlindedSpanHiding` (Lane B) reduces a span-recovery hiding break of the deployed
wide blinded commitment to `WidePreimageFloor` — and then PROVES, in the same file, that the
`CostAdversary.IsPolyTime` instance of that floor is FALSE at deployed parameters
(`widePreimageFloor_polyTime_false`): `idAdv` prices answer SIZE, never search difficulty, so the
constant finder that hardcodes the fixed honest opening is `IsPolyTime` and wins with probability
`1`. Every hiding statement conditioned on that floor is therefore VACUOUS at the deployed hash.

The repo's PROVEN fix for the collision side is the QUERY-BOUNDED KEYED RANDOM ORACLE:
`RomQueryFloor.birthday_bound` ((Q² + 1)/|R|, information-theoretic, no assumption) at the class
`RomEff`/`KeyedRomEff`, where the oracle is sampled AFTER the adversary tree is fixed — which is
what defeats hardcoding. This file transports that discipline to HIDING. The argument is the same
one-sentence fact that carries the birthday bound (`RomCounting.condProb_fresh_eq`): *what the
adversary has not queried, it does not know.*

## The game (§2) — two-world indistinguishability, `FloorGames.distAdv`-shaped

The adversary FIXES two messages `msg0 msg1 : Msg` (equal length BY TYPE — one abstract type of
fixed-width span digests, so "equal-length" is enforced by the formalization, not checked) and a
challenge-indexed query tree, all BEFORE anything is sampled. The challenger samples the oracle
`H : Msg × B → R` uniformly and the blinding `r : B` uniformly, and hands the adversary the
challenge digest `H (m_b, r)` — the deployed `hash(span_digest ‖ BLINDING)` shape with the
blinding a HIDDEN coordinate of the preimage. The adversary makes up to `Q` oracle queries and
outputs a guess bit; `hidingAdv` is the DIFFERENCE of the two worlds' accept probabilities —
a genuine distinguishing advantage (`FloorGames` §7's `distAdv` shape, NOT a `winProb`), which is
exactly the "full two-world indistinguishability" `BlindedSpanHiding` §(c).1 names as open.

## The bound (§4), PROVED, information-theoretic:  `hidingAdv ≤ 2·Q / |B|`

(`|B|` = the BLINDING space — the prompt's "R"; also stated in the cruder `(2Q + 1)/|B|` form.)
Identical-until-bad, done as finite counting with NO measure theory and NO assumption:

  * **The reprogramming lemma** (`condProb_pin_untouched`, §1): pinning the oracle at a point `d`
    does not move the probability of any event that is a function of the tree's output GATED ON
    "`d` was not queried". Proof: the update-at-`d` bijection between slices preserves `eval` and
    `queried` on that event (`RomOracle.OracleComp.eval_congr_of_agree_on_queried`), so all
    `|R|` slices of `RomCounting.condProb_split` carry equal weight.
  * **Identical-until-bad** (`condProb_pin_diff_le`): real world (challenge = `H (m_b, r)`,
    i.e. the oracle PINNED at the challenge point) and hybrid world (challenge a fresh uniform
    value, oracle free) differ by at most the probability of the BAD event — the adversary
    queries the challenge point `(m_b, r)`.
  * **The union bound** (`sum_touch_le`): a `Q`-query tree queries at most `Q` points per run, so
    summed over the uniform hidden blinding `r` the bad event has mass at most `Q/|B|`
    (`RomOracle.QueryBounded.queried_length_le`). In the hybrid the view is `b`-independent, so
    the advantage collapses through two hybrid hops: `2·Q/|B|`.

Same status as `birthday_bound`: a counting fact about the finite function space `Msg × B → R`,
with the query budget the only resource.

## Non-vacuity — BOTH poles, PROVED (§5, §6)

  * **`⊤` is not hiding**: the unrestricted adversary — a function reading the WHOLE experiment
    tape `(H, r)`, which is exactly what the raw `accept` type permits and the query-bounded class
    forbids — recomputes `H (m₀, r)` and compares it to the challenge: advantage EXACTLY
    `1 − 1/|R|` (`topAdv_hidingAdv`). At the deployed shape that is ≥ 1/2 at every parameter, so
    the unrestricted hiding floor is FALSE (`hidingTop_false`) and this file's floor is not
    vacuously true. The CANARY (`canary_top_breaks_bound`) pins a concrete instance where
    `topAdv`'s advantage `3/4` violates the `Q = 1` bound `1/4` — hence `topAdv` is PROVABLY not
    in the one-query class (`canary_topAdv_not_oneQuery`).
  * **The class is inhabited by a REAL winner**: the one-query distinguisher that probes
    `(msg0, r₀)` at a fixed blinding guess `r₀` has advantage EXACTLY `(1 − 1/|R|)/|B| > 0`
    (`oneQueryAdv_hidingAdv`, `oneQueryAdv_hidingAdv_pos`) — it really queries, really wins
    sometimes, and sits inside the bound. And the hardcoding adversary is DEFANGED, not excluded:
    a `0`-query guesser is admitted and its advantage is EXACTLY `0`
    (`zeroQuery_hidingAdv_eq_zero`) — sampling the blinding after the adversary is fixed is what
    kills it, the `KeyedRomFloor.fixedPairAdv_negl` story on the hiding side.

## The re-grounding (§7)

`spanHiding_regrounded`: at the deployed-shape family (`λ`-bit blinding felt, wide digest), the
keyed query-bounded hiding floor HOLDS — every `Q(λ)`-query adversary's span-distinguishing
advantage is `≤ (2·Q(λ) + 1)/2^λ`, negligible for polynomial `Q` — while Lane B's
`WidePreimageFloor (IsPolyTime …)`, the floor the old conditional hiding statement rested on, is
REFUTED (re-exported from `BlindedSpanHiding`, read-only). The proved keyed floor is the
replacement: same deployed object, a class with content, no hypothesis.

## HONEST HEADER — what is and is not claimed

This is **ROM hiding**: it models the wide Poseidon2 as a keyed random oracle, and the bound is
INFORMATION-THEORETIC in the query-bounded class — no computational assumption, the same status as
the birthday collision bound already in the tree (`RomQueryFloor` §5). The ONE named residual is
the ROM-modeling of Poseidon2 itself (standard, named, NOT discharged here — exactly the residual
`RomQueryFloor`'s collision floor carries). We do NOT claim hiding against arbitrary
polynomial-time adversaries: the class is the query-bounded keyed class, whose budget is a QUERY
count (unbounded work between queries is allowed, `RomQueryFloor`'s "named residual" section), and
the `⊤`-pole theorem shows the unrestricted claim would be FALSE. "Equal-length messages" is
enforced by TYPE (one fixed-width message type), not by a length check.

/-! ## §1 — the general reprogramming machinery, over an arbitrary oracle `D → R`.

`RomCounting` proves lazy sampling for the FRESH-point event (`condProb_fresh_eq`) — the collision
bound's engine. Hiding needs one more general fact, NOT in the tree yet: pinning the oracle at a
point the adversary does not query moves NOTHING. That is the identical-until-bad hop, and this
section proves it by the same slice bijection `cyl_insert_card_eq` uses, upgraded to carry the
tree's output along (`OracleComp.eval_congr_of_agree_on_queried` is what makes the upgrade true). -/

is a function of the tree's output GATED ON "`d` was not queried", the conditional probability in
the world where the oracle is pinned at `d` equals the free-world probability. This is the general
lazy-sampling fact hiding needs beyond `condProb_fresh_eq`: the challenge value can be pinned (to
the challenge the adversary was handed) without disturbing anything the adversary can see short of
querying the challenge point itself. -/

(the prompt's "R": the hidden uniform blinding the challenger samples AFTER the adversary is

blinding" — mirroring `KeyedRomFamily.toRomFamily`'s tag-fold. -/

`Metatheory.Open.BlindedSpanHiding` (Lane B, imported READ-ONLY) proved span hiding CONDITIONALLY
on `WidePreimageFloor (IsPolyTime …)` — and then proved that floor FALSE at deployed parameters
(`widePreimageFloor_polyTime_false`), naming the keyed query-counted class as the honest
successor and leaving the two-world indistinguishability form (§(c).1) OPEN. This section is that
successor: the deployed blinded-commitment shape — `hash(span_digest8 ‖ BLINDING)` with the
blinding a hidden uniform felt sampled after everything else is fixed — modeled with the wide
Poseidon2 as a keyed random oracle, at the deployed growth (a `λ`-bit blinding felt, a wide
digest), with the two-world hiding advantage BOUNDED and NEGLIGIBLE against every `Q`-query keyed
adversary. The named residual is the ROM-modeling of Poseidon2 — the same residual the collision
floor carries — NOT a refutable cost-model floor. -/

spans at every parameter; equal width BY TYPE), a `λ`-bit blinding felt `Fin (2^l)` (the deployed

/-- **(THE REPLACED FLOOR, RE-EXPORTED READ-ONLY.)** Lane B's own refutation: the
`WidePreimageFloor` at `IsPolyTime` — the floor its conditional span-hiding rested on — is FALSE
at every deployed commitment. This is the vacuity THIS file's floor replaces; pinned here so the
replacement is visible at the replacement site. -/

/-- **⚑⚑⚑ THE RE-GROUNDING, IN ONE STATEMENT.** Both halves at once:

  1. the deployed-shape wide blinded span commitment HIDES ITS SPAN — advantage at most
     `(2·Q(λ)+1)/2^λ`, negligible — against EVERY `Q`-query keyed adversary, PROVED
     (information-theoretic, keyed ROM, no assumption);
  2. the floor it replaces — Lane B's `WidePreimageFloor` at `IsPolyTime` — is REFUTED at every
     deployed commitment (Lane B's own theorem, re-exported).

The old conditional hiding statement rested on a false floor; the new one rests on counting. The
one named residual is the ROM-modeling of the wide Poseidon2 (standard, named, not discharged
here). -/
