# `Dregg2.Crypto.LightClientSoundness` — THE UNIVERSAL FOLD as a CRYPTO game: whole-history
light-client soundness reduced to the DL/MSIS/hash FLOOR.

The deployed light client (`lightclient/src/lib.rs::verify_history`, `wasm/src/
bindings_lightclient.rs::verify_finalized_devnet_history`) trusts a WHOLE finalized history by
folding a sequence of finalized-block certificates — each a quorum of HYBRID-SIGNED votes by the
ENROLLED committee, whose ids commit to their ML-DSA keys — and RE-WITNESSING NOTHING. This file
supplies the cryptographic soundness of that fold: it shows that a light client which accepts a
history has accepted a GENUINELY finalized chain — UNLESS a vote was FORGED (a `HybridCombiner.
Forgery` refuting `EufCma`, discharged to `SchnorrDLHard ∨ MSISHard`) or an ML-DSA key NOT COMMITTED
by its committee id was accepted (a hash collision refuting `IdentityCommitment`/`HashCR`).

The model composes three floors already in the tree, with NO fresh carrier:

* **the finalization leg** — `ConsensusSafety.Finalized`: a block is finalized at a height when a
  quorum of `q = n − f` distinct committee members each hold a valid HYBRID vote (`ConsensusSafety.
  ValidVote` under `HybridCombiner.hybrid Cl Pq`);
* **the enrollment leg** — `IdentityCommitment.verify_committed`: each committee member's id
  `H("dregg-hybrid-id-v1", ed ‖ len(ml) ‖ ml)` COMMITS its `(ed25519, ml_dsa)` pair, so the id IS the
  enrollment (`id_commitment_binds` / `attacker_key_not_committed` under `HashCR`);
* **the ordering leg** — a `Chained` list of certificates whose heights are the consecutive naturals
  from the genesis anchor (the fold's `new_height[i] = old_height[i] + 1` temporal tooth).

The `AcceptedHistory` structure IS what the light client builds as it folds. The theorems:

1. **`lightclient_sound`** — acceptance yields a genuinely finalized chain: each step is `Finalized`
   (by construction) AND every HONEST quorum member GENUINELY cast its vote — because an accepted
   `ValidVote` on a body an honest member never cast is a fresh valid signature = a `Forgery` refuting
   its `EufCma`. So under each honest member's `EufCma`, an accepted history is genuine.
2. **`accepting_forged_history_breaks_floor`** — the contrapositive with the floor plugged in: a light
   client that accepts a history crediting an honest member with a vote it never cast BREAKS the floor
   (the `Forgery` yields a `DLSolver` classically / two SelfTargetMSIS solutions on the pq side via
   `HybridCombiner.hybrid_secure_if_either_floor`, impossible under `SchnorrDLHard ∨ MSISHard`). *A
   light client that accepts a FORGED history yields a break of the floor.*
3. **`lightclient_agrees_with_full_node`** — the fold witnesses EXACTLY what a re-executor concludes:
   every step the light client attests, a full node re-executing the same certificates `Finalized`s
   (same object), and — `lightclient_no_fork` — the accepted history never contains two conflicting
   blocks at one height (`consensus_safe_under_floor`), so the light client and a full node never
   disagree.
4. **ANTI-LONG-RANGE** — a history signed by a NON-ENROLLED committee: accepting an attacker who
   keeps the honest ids but swaps in its OWN ml_dsa keys EXHIBITS a hash collision
   (`accepting_long_range_breaks_hashcr`, the `¬ HashCR`-conclusion extractor witness). ⚑ The old
   deterministic `no_long_range` (`HashCR`-conditioned rejection) is DELETED (floor refuted at every
   compressing commitment); the discharged successor is `IdentityCommitmentRegrounded`'s keyed-ROM
   opening bound (floor PROVED). This is the anti-long-range / anti-pale-ghost tooth.

## No named-carrier laundering

Every irreducible object is either the crypto FLOOR (`SchnorrDLHard`, `MSISHard`, `HashCR`), a
forking REDUCTION hypothesis (a forger ⟹ a solver — a theorem of the existing forking machinery, not
a carrier), or the honest protocol THRESHOLD (`n > 3f`, `≤ f` Byzantine) which is the honest dual of a
crypto floor. `EufCma` is DISCHARGED through `HybridCombiner`; the id binding is DISCHARGED through
`IdentityCommitment` to `HashCR`. Nothing else.

## Teeth (both polarities, load-bearing)

(a) an HONEST finalized 2-step history is ACCEPTED (`toyHistory`); (b) a history crediting a member
with a vote it never cast EXHIBITS the `Forgery` (`tooth_forged_vote_is_forgery`); (c) an attacker key
whose id does not commit it is REJECTED by the enrollment gate (`tooth_attacker_key_rejected`), and
accepting it would be a hash collision.

then every step is a genuinely finalized chain step: it is `Finalized` (by construction) AND every
HONEST quorum member GENUINELY cast its vote (`Q m` holds for the vote body). The second conjunct is
the cryptographic content: an accepted `ValidVote` by an honest member on a body it NEVER cast is a
fresh valid signature = a `HybridCombiner.Forgery` refuting that member's `EufCma`. So under each
honest member's `EufCma`, a light client that accepts a history has accepted a genuine one — every
credited honest vote was really cast. -/

the `HybridCombiner` reductions, NOT carriers), a light client that ACCEPTS a history crediting a
member `m` with a vote for `(c.height, c.block)` that `m` NEVER cast (`¬ Q m body`) yields a
contradiction under `SchnorrDLHard ∨ MSISHard`. The accepted `ValidVote` is a `Forgery`; `EufCma` on
`m`'s hybrid key — produced by `hybrid_secure_if_either_floor` — refutes it. So **a light client that
accepts a FORGED history yields a break of the floor** (DL or MSIS): the ONLY way an accepted history
is not genuine is if the floor already fell. -/

`hcr : HashCR` hypothesis is pure injectivity of the id-commitment hash, PROVED FALSE for every
compressing commitment (`HashFloorHonesty.hashCR_false_of_compressing`), so it rejected nothing at
deployed parameters. Its content survives as `accepting_long_range_breaks_hashcr` below (the
`¬ HashCR`-conclusion extractor witness: an ADMITTED non-enrolled key IS a hash collision); the
DISCHARGED successor is `IdentityCommitmentRegrounded`'s keyed-ROM opening bound — a query-bounded
adversary that opens one enrolled id with a second key pair has NEGLIGIBLE advantage on the PROVED
floor `keyedRom_hard`, so a long-range committee swap is rejected except with negligible
probability, in the keyed ROM model. -/

/-- **`accepting_long_range_breaks_hashcr` — the reduction.** If a light client nonetheless ACCEPTS
the attacker's non-enrolled key (its enrollment gate passes for `(edPk m₀, mlAtt m₀)`), that is a hash
collision: two DISTINCT key pairs `(edPk, mlPk) ≠ (edPk, mlAtt)` both verifying against one id BREAKS
`HashCR` (`distinct_verifying_pairs_break_hashcr`). So a long-range history is rejected — or the hash
floor already fell. -/
