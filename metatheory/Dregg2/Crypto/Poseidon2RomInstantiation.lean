# `Dregg2.Crypto.Poseidon2RomInstantiation` — ⚑ THE ONE CENTRAL Poseidon2-is-a-keyed-random-oracle
assumption, with BOTH faces of the deployed commitment — BINDING (collision-resistance) and HIDING —
reduced to it, at the EXACT deployed cardinalities.

## The scatter this centralizes

Before this file the ROM tower named its one idealization TWICE, in two different registers:

  * **hiding** named it in Lean (`Poseidon2RomHidingInstantiation.RomFaithfulHiding` /
    `Poseidon2RandomOracleInstantiation`, per adversary, at the deployed cardinalities); while
  * **collision-resistance** carried the SAME idealization as PROSE ONLY (`RomCarrierSites` header:
    "a deliberate, labelled idealisation … NOT a derivation") — and its idealization lives at the
    ASYMPTOTIC digest width `Fin (2 ^ l)`, which equals the deployed BabyBear felt count at NO `l`
    (`mirrorFamily_card_never_deployed`; `babyBearP` is odd).

So the tower rested on one Lean-named assumption beside one prose one — morally identical, unbound.
This file gives the ONE central Lean name and reduces BOTH faces to it.

## The construction

  * **§1 `KeyedRomFaithful H₀ w`** — the generic central predicate, PER EXPERIMENT: for a two-world
    observable `w : Bool → (D → R) → Ω → Bool` (world bit, oracle, auxiliary sample), the two-world
    advantage at the FIXED oracle `H₀` is at most the advantage when the oracle is SAMPLED —
    "the fixed hash serves this experiment no better than a fresh random oracle would". The ROM
    heuristic stated as the inequality it actually is; a `def`/hypothesis, NEVER an `axiom`.
  * **§2 `Poseidon2IsKeyedRandomOracle D w`** — ⚑⚑ THE CENTRAL NAMED ASSUMPTION, at the deployed
    object: `KeyedRomFaithful (deployedSpongeOracle D) w`. The oracle IS the deployed blinded-span
    commitment map (`deployedSpongeOracle_spec` pins it `rfl`-tight to
    `wideHash (tagCode ‖ span_digest8 ‖ C_T ‖ BLINDING ‖ 0)` decoded), over the KEYED
    (blinding-separated) domain `Span × Blind`, at the exact deployed cardinalities — blinding
    literally `Fin 2013265921`, digests `2013265921^8` — fixing on the collision face the
    asymptotic-width trap the prose version carried.
  * **§3 HIDING FROM IT.** `hidingObservable A` is the hiding experiment as an observable, and the
    bridge is DEFINITIONAL: `fixedWorldAdv/romWorldAdv` at it ARE `fixedHidingAdv/hidingAdv`
    (`rfl`), so the central assumption is EQUIVALENT to the previously named hiding assumption
    (`poseidon2KeyedRO_iff_hidingInstantiation`) — a re-expression, not a second floor — and the
    deployed hiding bound `≤ 2Q/2013265921` follows (`deployed_hiding_of_poseidon2KeyedRO`).
  * **§4 BINDING FROM IT.** `collisionObservable M` embeds the collision game as the same shape
    (world `false` ≡ reject, world `true` ≡ the collision indicator): the fixed-oracle advantage is
    the deployed-sponge collision INDICATOR, the sampled-oracle advantage is `winProb (collWin M)`,
    and the PROVED birthday floor (`RomQueryFloor.birthday_bound`, untouched) closes the reduction:
    under the central assumption a `Q`-query forger's deployed collision indicator is
    `≤ (Q² + 1)/2013265921^8` (`deployed_binding_of_poseidon2KeyedRO`); since an indicator is 0-or-1,
    for any `Q` under the birthday bar the forger exhibits NO collision of the deployed commitment
    map at all (`deployed_noCollision_of_poseidon2KeyedRO`), i.e. its output pair is NOT an
    equivocation — deployed binding (`deployed_blindedSpan_binding_of_poseidon2KeyedRO`).
  * **§5 BOTH POLES, ON BOTH FACES.** Satisfiable: the constant hiding distinguisher and the
    diagonal (equal-pair) forger are both faithful at EVERY deployed commitment. Refuted universal:
    the `∀`-form of the central assumption is FALSE on the hiding face (transported: the leak-sponge
    table-baker, fixed advantage `1`, ROM advantage `0`) AND on the collision face
    (`poseidon2KeyedRO_not_universal_collision`: at the leak sponge a 0-query fixed pair collides
    with fixed-oracle certainty but sampled-oracle probability exactly `1/2013265921^8`). So the
    honest assumption is PER-EXPERIMENT ("uses the sponge generically") — any lane upgrading it to
    `∀ w` is asserting a shape refuted here twice.

## HONEST HEADER — what is PROVED vs what is ASSUMED

This file NAMES and CENTRALIZES the idealization; it does NOT discharge it. Poseidon2-is-a-keyed-RO
(`Poseidon2IsKeyedRandomOracle`, per experiment) stays the ONE named floor the whole ROM tower rests
on — not dischargeable without idealization (Canetti–Goldreich–Halevi; the §5 refutations are its
finitary shadow, in-tree, on both faces). PROVED (kernel-clean, no assumption): both reductions and
everything under them (the birthday floor and the hiding floor are information-theoretic counting);
the definitional bridges; the concrete-cardinality arithmetic; both poles on both faces. ASSUMED
(the one named residual): the central instantiation itself, per experiment. Nothing here says
anything about the real hash bytes beyond that named instantiation.

ADDITIVE, and scope disclosed: every existing collision and hiding theorem is UNCHANGED — the
asymptotic-width keyed-ROM tower (`KeyedRomFloor.keyedRom_hard` → `RomBindingReduction` →
`RomCarrierSites` → the `_binds_rom` sites, which the FRI closure consumes) still stands exactly as
it was, still carrying its prose caveat at its own sites. What THIS file adds beside it is the
deployed-cardinality statement of both faces under the one central name. The collision face here is
the blinded-span commitment map — the SAME deployed object hiding is about, which is exactly what
makes one shared oracle (hence one shared assumption) possible; re-pointing `RomCarrierSites`' other
per-site prose caveats at `KeyedRomFaithful` instances over their own domains is follow-up
(un-additive) rewiring, surfaced, not smuggled.

## Axiom hygiene

`#assert_all_clean` ⊆ {propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}; no `sorry`, NO new `axiom`, no
`native_decide`. The central assumption is a `def` reduced-to. NEW ADDITIVE file; imports read-only.

/-! ## §4 — BINDING (collision-resistance) reduces to the SAME central assumption.

A collision of `deployedSpongeOracle D` is exactly an EQUIVOCATION of the deployed blinded-span
commitment: two distinct `(span, blinding)` openings with equal commitment digest. The collision
game embeds into the central two-world shape with world `false` ≡ reject and NO auxiliary
randomness (`Ω := Unit`) — at a fixed public sponge the collision game has no residual sample, which
is precisely why the old prose caveat could not literally reuse the hiding predicate; the shared
OBSERVABLE shape is what unifies them. -/
