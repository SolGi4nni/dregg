# `Dregg2.Crypto.RomBindingReduction` — a deployed commitment binding, RE-GROUNDED on the keyed,
query-counted floor, with the forger an ORACLE PROGRAM and the floor PROVED (not assumed, not false).

## What this re-grounds, and why the raw-function spine could not be re-grounded in place

`SpongeCarrierReduction.carrier_binds_from_polyTime` and
`Market.WideCommitBoundary.stateCommit_binds_from_polyTime` are the deployed commitment bindings. They
are SECURITY REDUCTIONS — a forger becomes a hash-collision finder — but they discharge efficiency at
`Eff := CostAdversary.IsPolyTime`, and

    HashCRHardQuant (spongeFamily D) (IsPolyTime (spongeAnsSize D))

is **FALSE** at deployed parameters (`Exec.SystemRootsBindingReduction.sysRoots_floor_polyTime_false_babyBear`):
`IsPolyTime` prices answer SIZE, so a `Classical.choice` `.pure`-leaf answering with a short collision
is in the class and wins. Those reductions are therefore VACUOUS at the discharge site.

⚑ **The floor cannot be repaired by choosing a better `Eff` over the SAME game.** In
`hashGame (spongeFamily D)` the hash is a FIXED, KNOWN function and only the tag is sampled. Against a
fixed known function, an adversary that may query it — even a QUERY-BOUNDED one — brute-forces a
collision (the function is public), so NO query-counted `Eff` makes that floor both true and
non-vacuous. Collision resistance of a FIXED function is not a Lean theorem; it is a conjecture. The
floor must move to a SAMPLED oracle (the random-oracle model of the deployed sponge), where the birthday
bound is a THEOREM and query-counting has teeth. That is `KeyedRomFloor`, and it is what this module
reduces to.

## The re-grounded shape (the pattern every `_binds_from_polyTime` should become)

  * **The forger is an ORACLE PROGRAM.** `RomCarrierComp` — a per-parameter `OracleComp` over the
    tag-separated domain, `Q`-query-bounded (`RomCarrierEff`). It learns the sponge only by querying it,
    exactly as the deployed prover does; the key/oracle is sampled AFTER the program is fixed.
  * **The extractor is a POST-MAP of the program** (`OracleComp.mapOut`), so a query-bounded forger
    yields a query-bounded collision finder — `carrierFinder_in_romEff`, the honest successor to the
    `poly_time` discharge, and it PRESERVES the query bound rather than pricing answer size.
  * **The floor is PROVED.** `romCarrier_binds` closes the binding from `KeyedRomFloor.keyedRom_hard`
    (the birthday bound), with NO false hypothesis and NO cost model.
  * **The counterexample dies.** `romCarrier_choiceForger_excluded`: a forger whose advantage is not
    negligible is OUTSIDE the class — the direct analogue of `shortCollAdv`'s exclusion, now at the
    binding layer.

## What a full A1 unification (`docs/reference/ADOPT-ARKLIB-VCVIO-IDEAS.md`) still needs

This closes the carrier PATTERN. Re-pointing each deployed `_binds_from_polyTime` at it is the
remaining mechanical work: the raw-function forger `Adversary (carrierBreakGame …)` /
`Adversary (stateCommitBreakGame …)` must be RESTATED as a `RomCarrierComp`-style oracle program, and
`carrierBreakToFinder` / `stateBreakToWireBreak → wireBreakToFinder` composed with `mapOut`. The
reduction bodies transfer unchanged; only the adversary TYPE moves from a raw function to a query tree.
No new proof of collision resistance is created or needed — the birthday floor supplies it.

⚑ The CHAINED case is NOT mechanical, and is now CLOSED: for `wireCommitR8` the collision sits at an
interior chain step that depends on the oracle's answers, so the extractor cannot be a `mapOut` — it
must RE-WALK both chains, paying queries. `RomChainedReduction` supplies that (`OracleComp.bind`, the
chain as an oracle program, the walking extractor, `romChained_binds`), and
`Market.WideCommitBoundary` §P/§Q/§S lands it on the deployed state-commit schedule — the vacuous
`stateCommit_binds_from_polyTime` is DELETED there, with its floor hypothesis PROVED false
(`stateCommit_floor_polyTime_false_babyBear`).

/-! ## §2 — a deployed commitment carrier, with an oracle-program forger. -/

/-- **A DEPLOYED COMMITMENT CARRIER over a keyed random oracle.** The commitment is `H (encode c v)`
for a structural encoding into the tag-separated domain that is injective in the payload. This is the
`SpongeCarrier.ofFlatEncoding` shape — the commonest deployed 1-felt commitment — moved to the oracle
model: the only per-site content is `encode` and its injectivity, and the reduction supplies the rest. -/

  H (C.encode l c v)

/-- **THE CARRIER FORGERY GAME.** The instance is the sampled keyed oracle; the adversary wins iff it
outputs a context and two DISTINCT payloads carrying the SAME commitment — it equivocates the deployed
commitment. The break is IN the win relation, and it is checked against the SAMPLED oracle. -/

learns the sponge only by querying it. -/

/-- **⚑ THE QUERY-BOUNDED CARRIER CLASS — the fixed `Eff` at the binding layer.** A carrier forger is
efficient iff it factors through a `Q`-query tree. This is the honest successor to the `IsPolyTime`
discharge: it bounds QUERIES, and the oracle is sampled after the tree is fixed. -/

/-! ## §3 — the reduction: the extractor as a MAP OF ADVERSARIES, at the oracle level. -/

/-- **THE EXTRACTOR, AS A MAP OF ADVERSARIES.** A commitment equivocator becomes a collision finder by
returning the two encoded messages. This is the reduction; `encode_inj` is why it works. -/
def carrierFinder (F : KeyedRomFamily) (C : RomCarrier F)

  run := fun l H => let p := A.run l H; (C.encode l p.1 p.2.1, C.encode l p.1 p.2.2)

/-- **⚑ WIN-PRESERVATION.** Every oracle on which the equivocator wins, the extracted finder wins the
collision game of the SAMPLED oracle: the two encoded messages are distinct (`encode_inj` on the
distinct payloads) and share a digest (the equal commitments). -/

/-- **⚑ THE ADVANTAGE INEQUALITY — UNCONDITIONAL, over ALL adversaries.** The equivocator's advantage
is at most the extracted collision finder's, at every parameter. The adversary class does NOT appear;
it enters only when the floor is applied. -/

/-- **⚑ THE EXTRACTED FINDER IS QUERY-BOUNDED — the efficiency discharge, PRESERVING THE QUERY BOUND.**
A `Q`-query carrier forger yields a `Q`-query collision finder, because the extractor is a `mapOut`
post-composition (`OracleComp.mapOut_queryBounded`), which adds no queries. This is what replaces the
`poly_time` answer-size discharge: the finder is admitted by `RomEff` because it makes few CALLS, not
because it writes a short answer. -/

/-- **⚑⚑ THE RE-GROUNDED BINDING — from the KEYED, QUERY-COUNTED floor, WHICH IS PROVED.**

A carrier forger in the query-bounded class has NEGLIGIBLE advantage: at a `λ`-bit digest and a
polynomial query budget, the deployed commitment binds its payload except with negligible probability.

This is what replaces `carrier_binds_from_polyTime` / `stateCommit_binds_from_polyTime`. The difference
is the whole point: the floor here is `keyedRom_hard`, a THEOREM (the birthday bound), whereas the
`IsPolyTime` floor those carry is FALSE at deployed parameters. Efficiency is discharged by
`carrierFinder_in_romEff` (query-bound preservation), not by pricing answer size. -/

binding layer: a forger that equivocates the commitment with non-negligible probability is NOT in the
query-bounded class — if it were, `romCarrier_binds` would make its advantage negligible. So the
strategy that refutes the `IsPolyTime`-discharged binding cannot produce a member of the fixed class. -/

/-- **A CONCRETE CARRIER** — the identity commitment `enc H _ v = H v` on the tag-separated domain: an
