# `Dregg2.Crypto.RomCarrierSites` — the per-site instantiation kit for the keyed-ROM binding.

## What this is

`Crypto.RomBindingReduction` proved the carrier PATTERN once: an oracle-program forger
(`RomCarrierComp`, `Q`-query-bounded), an extractor that is a post-map (`OracleComp.mapOut`, budget
preserved), and the binding closed from the PROVED keyed floor (`KeyedRomFloor.keyedRom_hard`, the
birthday bound) with NO false `IsPolyTime` hypothesis. What each deployed `_binds_from_polyTime` site
still needs to consume it is MECHANICAL but repetitive:

  1. a `KeyedRomFamily` whose digest space is the `λ`-growing `Fin (2 ^ l)` — so the floor's
     `hw : card (R l) = 2 ^ l` obligation is discharged ONCE (`flatFamily_card_R`), never restated;
  2. a `RomCarrier` built from the site's structural encoding, with the domain-separation tag carried
     in the CONTEXT (`taggedCarrier`) — so per-site content is exactly the encoder and its
     payload-injectivity, the same two facts `SpongeCarrier.ofFlatEncoding` took;
  3. for CHAINED sites (commitment absorbs digest absorbs sub-block), sequential composition of oracle
     programs (`OracleComp.bindComp`) with ADDITIVE query accounting, and the union bound over two
     carriers of ONE family (`chained_rom_binds`) — the ROM successor of
     `EncodedBindingReduction.chained_binding_advantage_bound`, with the floor PROVED instead of
     parametric.

This module supplies those pieces once. It creates NO new collision-resistance claim: every binding
below is `romCarrier_binds` (hence `keyedRom_hard`, hence the birthday bound) applied.

## ⚑ The modelling caveat every consumer inherits (say it, do not smuggle it)

A site landing here has taken the standard RANDOM-ORACLE IDEALISATION of the deployed domain-separated
Poseidon2 sponge at an ASYMPTOTIC digest width: the sampled `H : Key × Msg → Fin (2 ^ l)` replaces the
fixed public `sponge (tagCode t ++ ·)`, and there is NO `l` at which `Fin (2 ^ l)` IS the deployed
31-bit BabyBear felt. That is a MODELLING step — a deliberate, labelled idealisation, exactly as
`DomainSeparatedCREffRegrounded` §5 demands — NOT a derivation. What it buys over the deleted
`IsPolyTime` discharge: the floor under the reduction is a THEOREM about the model instead of a
hypothesis that is FALSE at the deployed object. What it does not buy: any statement about the fixed
deployed sponge itself — collision resistance of a fixed public function is a conjecture, not a Lean
theorem (`RomBindingReduction` header, proved reasoning).

## Non-fake

Both generic poles are priced at the floor (`KeyedRomFloor` §3–§5). Here: the query class at any
carrier is INHABITED by the `0`-query constant answerer (`constTriple_in_eff`) whose advantage is
POSITIVE at every parameter (`constTriple_gameAdv_pos`) yet NEGLIGIBLE (`constTriple_binds`) — the
admitted-but-defanged pole, the exact transplant of the `shortCollAdv` shape that refutes the
`IsPolyTime` floor.

No `sorry`, no `axiom`, no `native_decide`. `#assert_all_clean` ⊆ {propext, Classical.choice,
Quot.sound}.

`RomBindingReduction.OracleComp.mapOut` post-maps a program's ANSWER without touching its queries.
A chained extractor must do more: run the forger's program, then make FURTHER queries that depend on
its answer (re-query the two inner digests). That is monadic `bind`, and its budget is the SUM. -/

/-! ## §2 — the FLAT FAMILY: any finite deployed message shape, under the `λ`-bit ideal digest. -/

/-- **A KEYED ROM FAMILY FROM A DEPLOYED MESSAGE SHAPE.** The key is the site's own domain-separation
tag space; the message domain is the site's (finite, possibly `λ`-indexed) absorbed shape; the digest
space is the ideal `Fin (2 ^ l)`. ⚑ The digest space is the MODELLING step (header): `λ`-growing where
the deployed felt is fixed ~31-bit. It is what lets `keyedRom_hard`'s `hw` close by computation. -/

/-- **THE `hw` OBLIGATION, DISCHARGED ONCE.** Every flat family has a `2 ^ l`-element digest space by
construction, so no site restates the floor's width obligation — the single biggest per-site trap
(`card BabyBear ≠ 2 ^ l` for any `l`) is closed at the constructor. -/

/-! ## §3 — the TAGGED CARRIER: the site's structural encoding, tag in the context. -/

/-- **A CARRIER FROM A STRUCTURAL EMBEDDING, TAG-IN-CONTEXT.** The context is a domain-separation tag
together with the site's own fixed opening data; the commitment is one oracle query at
`(tag, emb ctx val)`. The ONLY per-site obligations are the embedding into the message shape and its
injectivity in the payload — the same two facts `SpongeCarrier.ofFlatEncoding` took, with the width
obligation absorbed into the finiteness of `Msg`. -/

  encode_inj := fun l c a b h => emb_inj l c.2 a b (congrArg Prod.snd h)

/-- **⚑ THE FLAT-SITE BINDING — NO width obligation, NO floor hypothesis.** Any carrier over a flat
family binds against every query-bounded forger: `romCarrier_binds` with `hw` closed by
`flatFamily_card_R`. The hypotheses that remain — a polynomial query budget and the forger's
membership in the query class — are the honest ones; nothing refutable is carried. -/

advantage, and that answerer is DEFANGED (its advantage is negligible), not excluded. -/

/-- **THE CONSTANT ANSWERER** — the `0`-query program returning a fixed context and two fixed

  ⟨constTripleComp F C c v w, fun l => QueryBounded.pure (Q l) _, fun _ _ => rfl⟩

/-- **THE GAME IS WINNABLE — the advantage is POSITIVE at every parameter.** The constant oracle maps
both encodings to one digest, so on distinct payloads the constant answerer wins somewhere; hence the
binding theorems bound something that is genuinely nonzero, not the advantage of an unwinnable game. -/

itself: admitted by the class, positive advantage, NEGLIGIBLE advantage. Against the fixed sponge this
shape wins with probability `1` and refutes the `IsPolyTime` floor; against the sampled oracle its
advantage collapses. This is the counterexample dying at the carrier layer, per carrier. -/

both carrier games share the sampled-instance space and the union bound is a `winProb` fact. -/

/-! ## §6 — two more carrier constructors: a PINNED tag, and a KEY-DEPENDENT encoder.

`taggedCarrier` lets the adversary choose the tag in its context.  Two deployed shapes need more:

  * a site that attacks ONE fixed role (the XM-VRF leaf layer is `Role.leaf`, never a chosen tag) pins
    the tag in the ENCODING — `fixedTagCarrier`;
  * a site whose deployed serialization READS the key (`EncodedBindingReduction`'s
    `enc : ∀ l, Key l → α → Input`) carries the key in the context and the encoder consumes it —
    `keyedEncCarrier`.

Both are still just `RomCarrier`s: no new game, no new floor. -/

/-! ## §7 — the OPENING game: the PUBLISHED commitment IN the win relation.

`romCarrierGame` compares the two commitments to EACH OTHER.  The deployed break the
`commitOpenGame`-shaped sites state (`HermineHashCRRegrounded` §2 and its six instantiations) is
stronger in SHAPE: the adversary PUBLISHES a value and exhibits two DISTINCT payloads that BOTH open
it — the published value is part of the forgery, exactly as a beacon output, a session key or an
enrollment id is published on the wire.  This section is that game at the SAMPLED oracle, closed from
the SAME proved floor: the extractor DROPS the published value (`mapOut`, budget preserved) and the
two openings collide through it. -/

Deployed sites absorb variable-length limb lists (`List ℤ`).  A ROM message domain must be FINITE, so
the honest truncation is "length at most `m`, limbs in range" — the `SysRomMsg` move of
`Exec.SystemRootsBindingReduction` §7, supplied here once as a reusable shape.  `bvecOfList` embeds a
bounded list; `bvecOfList_inj` is the losslessness tooth: NOTHING the deployed prover can absorb (at
the truncation bound) is identified. -/
