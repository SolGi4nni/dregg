# `Dregg2.Crypto.RomChainedReduction` — the CHAINED commitment as an ORACLE COMPUTATION, and its
binding RE-GROUNDED on the keyed, query-counted floor.

## Why the flat carrier does not cover the deployed state commit

`RomBindingReduction.RomCarrier` re-grounds every commitment of the shape `H (encode c v)` — ONE
oracle call per commitment. The deployed wide state anchor is not that shape:
`Market.WideCommitBoundary.commit8` is `wireCommitR8`, a CHAINED absorption — a 4-limb head is
absorbed, then 3-limb chunks EACH FEEDING THE PREVIOUS DIGEST BACK INTO THE NEXT CALL, then the
receipt root last. A forger against it does not equivocate one query; it equivocates a CHAIN of
queries, and the collision its forgery yields sits at some INTERIOR step whose position depends on
the oracle's own answers. So the extractor cannot be a post-map of the forger's output
(`RomBindingReduction.OracleComp.mapOut` adds no queries and sees no digests): to FIND the colliding
step it must WALK both chains, querying the oracle as it goes — and those queries must be PAID FOR
in the class the floor quantifies over.

## What this file adds (the three missing objects, in the model where the floor is PROVED)

  * **§1 THE CHAIN AS AN ORACLE PROGRAM.** `chainComp enc acc bs` — one `query` node per absorption
    step, the previous ANSWER threaded into the next query point. `chainComp_eval` proves its run
    against any oracle is the fixed-function fold `chainEval`, and `chainComp_queryBounded` prices
    it at exactly one query per block. `Market.WideCommitBoundary.wireCommitComp` instantiates it at
    the DEPLOYED `wireCommitR8` schedule and proves `eval permW = wireCommitR8 permW l ir` — the
    deployed chained commitment IS this program, run at the deployed permutation.
  * **§2 THE CHAINED CARRIER AND ITS FORGERY GAME.** `RomChainedCarrier` — per-site content is the
    head/step encodings into the tag-separated domain and their injectivity: LAYOUT facts a
    deployment genuinely satisfies, never a claim about the hash. The forger (`RomChainedComp`,
    class `RomChainedEff`) is an oracle program fixed BEFORE the oracle is sampled.
  * **§3 THE EXTRACTOR AS AN ORACLE PROGRAM WITH A PAID BUDGET.** `breakFinderComp` re-walks both
    chains two queries per step and returns the first colliding query pair; `OracleComp.bind`
    sequences it after the forger, and `chainedFinder_in_romEff` prices the composed finder at
    `Q + 2·len + 2` queries. The honest successor to `mapOut` for a chained site: the extractor's
    own queries are COUNTED, not free.

`romChained_binds` (§4) closes the binding from `KeyedRomFloor.keyedRom_hard` — the birthday bound,
a THEOREM — with no cost model and no false hypothesis. `romChained_choiceForger_excluded` kills the
`Classical.choice` collision-answerer at this layer: a chained forger whose advantage is not
negligible is OUTSIDE the query-bounded class, because inside it the binding applies.

## Non-vacuity (§5)

The class is inhabited (`fixedChainedForger_in_eff`, a 0-query member) and the game is genuinely
winnable (`romChainedGame_win_at_const`: at a constant oracle EVERY distinct payload pair
equivocates — the chain forgets its input once the digests agree), so the binding is a statement
about a non-empty event over a non-empty class. The deployed-shape instantiation — and the labelled
MODELLING step it requires (`hw` forces a λ-growing digest space; the deployed BabyBear felt is
fixed 31-bit) — lives beside the object it re-grounds, in `Market.WideCommitBoundary` §S.

## Axiom hygiene

`#assert_all_clean` ⊆ {propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}; no `sorry`, no fresh `axiom`, no
`native_decide`.

/-! ## §0 — sequential composition of oracle programs, and its budget law.

The extractor for a chained site must RUN the forger and THEN keep querying (the chain walk). That
is `bind` — absent from `RomOracle` because the flat reduction only needed `mapOut`. Its two laws
are exactly the two the reduction consumes: running the composition is running the pieces
(`bind_eval`), and budgets ADD (`bind_queryBounded`). -/

/-- **RUN ONE ORACLE PROGRAM, THEN ANOTHER that depends on its output** — graft `f a` onto every
`pure a` leaf, keeping every `query` node.

(⚠ Like `RomBindingReduction.OracleComp.mapOut`, this is declared INSIDE this namespace: its full
name is `Dregg2.Crypto.RomChainedReduction.OracleComp.bind`, and dot-notation `M.bind` will NOT
resolve to it. Open this namespace or fully qualify.) -/

output, against the same oracle. -/

  | query d k ih =>
      show (OracleComp.bind (k (H d)) f).eval H = (f ((k (H d)).eval H)).eval H
      exact ih (H d)

/-- **BUDGETS ADD under sequencing.** A `QM`-query program followed by a `QF`-query continuation is
a `(QM + QF)`-query program — every path interleaves at most both budgets. This is what lets the
chain-walking extractor's queries be PAID rather than smuggled. -/

/-! ## §1 — THE CHAINED ABSORPTION, AS AN ORACLE COMPUTATION.

The deployed shape (`wireCommitR8` / `chainFrom8`): an accumulator digest, updated one block at a
time by hashing `enc acc b`. Generic in the domain/range/block types so the SAME definition serves
the deployed `List ℤ` fold (where `enc acc b = acc ++ b` and the "oracle" is the fixed `permW`) and
the finite tag-separated oracle domain of the keyed floor. -/

/-- The FIXED-FUNCTION chained absorption: fold the blocks through `H ∘ enc`. At
`enc acc b = acc ++ b`, `H = permW` this IS the deployed `chainFrom8`

/-- **⚑ THE CHAIN, AS AN ORACLE PROGRAM** — one `query` node per absorption step, each query point
built from the PREVIOUS ANSWER. This is the object the re-pointing campaign named: the chained

digest only by asking the oracle. -/

`r₀`, whatever the blocks. The non-vacuity witness below rides on this. -/

chained fold: absorb the head (`encHd`), then `len` blocks, each step re-absorbing the previous
digest (`encStep`). The per-site content is the two structural encodings into the tag-separated
domain and their injectivity — layout facts the deployment genuinely satisfies (fixed widths make
`acc ++ c` injective in the pair), NEVER a claim about the hash. The chain LENGTH is pinned by the
carrier (`len`), as deployed: the wide state anchor absorbs a fixed 178-limb payload schedule. -/

/-! ## §3 — the extractor: a CHAIN WALK that pays its own queries.

Two equal-length chains with equal final digests but different inputs must disagree at some query
point while agreeing on the answer — a genuine collision of the SAMPLED oracle. Which step that is
depends on the oracle, so the extractor re-runs both chains (two queries per step), comparing as it
goes. `chainCollComp` is that walk as an oracle program; `chainCollComp_eval_collides` is its
correctness; `breakFinderComp` adds the head layer. -/

/-- **THE CHAIN WALK, AS AN ORACLE PROGRAM.** Walk both chains in lockstep; at each step query both
points; the first step whose points DIFFER while the answers AGREE is a collision — return it.
`dflt` is returned only on paths where no collision is found (never taken on a winning forgery, as
the spec proves). -/

/-- **⚑⚑ THE RE-GROUNDED CHAINED BINDING — from the KEYED, QUERY-COUNTED floor, WHICH IS PROVED.**

A chained-commitment forger in the query-bounded class has NEGLIGIBLE advantage: at a `λ`-bit
digest and a polynomial total budget `Q'` dominating the forger's queries PLUS the extractor's
re-walk, the chained commitment binds its whole payload — head and every block — except with
negligible probability. The floor is `keyedRom_hard` (the birthday bound, a theorem); efficiency is
discharged by `chainedFinder_in_romEff` (query accounting), not by pricing answer sizes. This is
what replaces `stateCommit_binds_from_polyTime`, whose `IsPolyTime` floor is FALSE at deployed
parameters (`Market.WideCommitBoundary.stateCommit_floor_polyTime_false_babyBear`). -/

`romChained_binds` would collapse its advantage. The strategy that refutes every `IsPolyTime`
floor (answer with a known collision of the fixed function) cannot produce a member of this class:
against the SAMPLED oracle it would have to know a collision it never queried, and
`RomOracle.OracleComp.eval_congr_of_agree_on_queried` forbids that. -/
