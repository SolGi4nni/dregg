# `Dregg2.Crypto.RomHashedLeafOpening` — the HASHED-LEAF Merkle opening as a keyed-ROM object:
one family for a whole deployed tree (leaf blocks ⊕ node pairs), its single-absorb carriers, the
pure-path walk, and the LEAF-LEVEL opening whose extractor pays two leaf queries plus the walk.

## What this re-grounds

The deployed native-8-felt trees (`Circuit.DeployedCapTree`, `Circuit.DeployedHeapTree`,
`Circuit.DeployedFieldsTree`) each ride ONE chip (`descriptor_ir2::chip_absorb_all_lanes`) in two
arities: a short LEAF block (7 cap fields / 3 IMT limbs) and the arity-16 `node8` pack of two 8-felt
children, and their binding surface is currently exported as `…_binds_or_collides` DISJUNCTIONS —
"bind, or here is the colliding pair". At deployed parameters a collision EXISTS by pigeonhole, so a
bare disjunction is satisfiable through its right branch without any binding; the disjunction is an
extractor witness, not a security statement. The security statement lives HERE: the forger is an
ORACLE PROGRAM over a SAMPLED tag-separated oracle, fixed before the oracle is drawn, and every
export closes from `KeyedRomFloor.keyedRom_hard` — the birthday bound, a THEOREM, with no refuted
floor and no cost model.

## The one family, and why the shapes live together

`hlFam` domain-separates the two deployed absorbs by constructor inside ONE message space:

  * `Sum.inl (b : Leaf l)` — the truncated leaf block (the site's `leafFields` image);
  * `Sum.inr (x, y)`       — the ordered two-child node pair, at the IDEAL digest width.

One family means the leaf carrier, the node carrier, the pure-path walk and the hashed-leaf opening
all play over the SAME sampled oracle, so the opening's union-free case split (leaf digests collide /
they differ and the path walk lands on an interior node collision) is a single-game reduction.

## The four exported shapes (per deployed tree, instantiated per site)

  1. `hlLeaf_binds_rom` — the leaf digest binds its whole block (`flatSite_binds` at `hlLeafCarrier`);
  2. `hlNode_binds_rom` — the node digest binds BOTH ordered children (`flatSite_binds` at
     `hlNodeCarrier`) — the `nodeOf8`/`pack8` layout content at the ideal width;
  3. `hlPathRom_binds` — the `recomposeUp8` shape: two DISTINCT starting digests folding one SHARED
     `(bit, sibling)` schedule to one root cost an interior node collision, found by the re-walking
     extractor (`walkComp`, `2·depth` queries PAID);
  4. `hlOpenRom_binds` (+ the published-root form `hlOpenRootRom_binds`) — the `capOpen8`/GENTIAN
     shape: two DISTINCT leaves whose HASHED digests fold up one shared path to one root. The
     extractor queries both leaf points (2 queries); equal answers ARE the leaf-block collision,
     distinct answers hand the walk two distinct accumulators.

## ⚑ The modelling step every consumer inherits (say it, do not smuggle it)

Landing a deployed tree here idealises the fixed 8-output Poseidon2 chip as a keyed random oracle
into `Fin (2 ^ l)` (`RomCarrierSites` header discipline): an 8-felt child digest is ONE sampled
ideal value, the ordered pair `(x, y)` carries exactly the layout content `pack8` carries (order
preserved, both children bound), and there is NO `l` at which `Fin (2 ^ l)` is the deployed 8×~31-bit
digest. What this buys over the disjunction: a floor that is PROVED where the disjunction's right
branch was FREE. What it does not buy: any statement about the fixed public chip itself — collision
resistance of a fixed function is a conjecture, not a Lean theorem (`RomBindingReduction` header).

## Axiom hygiene

`#assert_all_clean` ⊆ {propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}; no `sorry`, no fresh `axiom`, no
`native_decide`.
