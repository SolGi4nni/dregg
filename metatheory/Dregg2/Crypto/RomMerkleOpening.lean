# `Dregg2.Crypto.RomMerkleOpening` — the MERKLE-PATH OPENING as a keyed-ROM object, its
walking extractor PAYING its own queries, and the binding from the PROVED floor.

## What this re-grounds

The deployed Merkle opening (`OodCommitmentBinding.merkleRecomputeZ`, `FriVerifier.merkleRecompute`,
`FriCompressRegrounded.merkleRecompute`) recomputes an opened leaf up a sibling path — one node hash
per level, the index bit fixing the order — and compares the result to a committed root. Its binding
used to be discharged at `Eff := CostAdversary.IsPolyTime` over the FIXED-hash game
(`FloorRegroundedConsumers.oodCommitmentOpening_advantage_bound` and its siblings), and that floor is
**FALSE at deployed parameters** (`Exec.SystemRootsBindingReduction.sysRoots_floor_polyTime_false_babyBear`):
`IsPolyTime` prices answer SIZE, so a `Classical.choice` `.pure`-leaf answering a short collision is
in the class and wins with probability `1`. Nor can a better `Eff` repair the fixed-hash game
(`RomBindingReduction` header): the floor must move to a SAMPLED oracle, where the birthday bound is
a THEOREM (`KeyedRomFloor.keyedRom_hard`).

## Why neither `RomCarrier` nor `RomChainedCarrier` covers this shape

  * `RomBindingReduction.RomCarrier` is ONE query per commitment (`H (encode c v)`); a path recompute
    is a CHAIN of queries, so `mapOut` cannot extract the interior collision.
  * `RomChainedReduction.RomChainedCarrier` chains over the PAYLOAD's blocks after a HEAD QUERY
    (`chainEval … (H (encHd c v.1)) (blocks v)`), and its win compares two payloads over ONE block
    schedule owned by the payload. The Merkle opening is the TRANSPOSE: the chain's starting
    accumulator IS the payload (the opened leaf, never pre-hashed), and the block schedule (index
    bits + siblings) is CONTEXT the two claims SHARE. Its extractor therefore needs only
    LEFT-injectivity of the step encoding (same block on both sides), not pair-injectivity — which
    is exactly why `chainCollComp` cannot be reused: its correctness consumes pair-injectivity that
    the ordered node encoding `(acc, s)`/`(s, acc)` does not have.

This file supplies the missing object once: the same-context chain walk (`walkComp`), its
unconditional correctness (`walkComp_eval_collides`), the opening forgery as a
`RomCarrierSites.RomForgery` over the node-pair family, and the binding `merkleOpenRom_binds` from
`keyedRom_hard` — no cost model, no false hypothesis, the extractor's `2·depth` queries PAID in the
same currency the floor counts.

## ⚑ The modelling step every consumer inherits (say it, do not smuggle it)

Landing a deployed Merkle site here idealises the fixed Poseidon2 node hash as a keyed RANDOM ORACLE
`H : Key × (digest × digest) → Fin (2 ^ l)` at an ASYMPTOTIC digest width (`RomCarrierSites` header,
`DomainSeparatedCREffRegrounded` §5's rule): there is NO `l` at which `Fin (2 ^ l)` is the deployed
~31-bit BabyBear felt, and at the deployed width the honest reading stays "binds exactly as well as
~31 bits allow" (birthday ≈ `2^15.5`, the felt-width wound). What the move buys over the deleted
`IsPolyTime` discharge: the floor under the reduction is a THEOREM about the model instead of a
hypothesis that is FALSE at the deployed object.

## Axiom hygiene

`#assert_all_clean` ⊆ {propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}; no `sorry`, no fresh `axiom`, no
`native_decide`.

`FloorRegroundedConsumers.merkleOpenBreakGame`'s win relation, transposed to the oracle model: the

/-! ## §3 — the SAME-CONTEXT chain walk: the extractor, paying two queries per level.

Two chains that share their block schedule but start at DISTINCT accumulators and end EQUAL must
merge at some interior level — and the merge point is a genuine collision of the sampled oracle.
Which level that is depends on the oracle's answers, so the extractor re-walks both chains, two
queries per level. Left-injectivity of the step encoding keeps the two query points distinct for as
long as the accumulators are. -/

/-- **THE WALK, AS AN ORACLE PROGRAM.** Descend the shared blocks with both accumulators; at each
level query both node points; the first level whose points differ (they do, while the accumulators
do) but whose answers AGREE is the collision — return it. `dflt` is returned only past the end of
the path, which the spec's hypotheses exclude. -/

shared block schedule agree yield a genuine collision of the oracle: two distinct query points with

`nodeMsg_left_inj` supplies. At an empty schedule the equal folds ARE the accumulators, refuting
their distinctness, so that branch is closed by contradiction. -/

/-- **(TOOTH — the game is genuinely WINNABLE: the constant answerer wins at the constant
oracle.)** At positive depth the fold forgets its leaf, so ANY two distinct leaves equivocate
there; the advantage the binding bounds is positive, not the advantage of an unwinnable game.
Distinct leaves exist at every `l ≥ 1` (`Fin (2 ^ l)` has two elements). -/

the class and the binding applies to it: positive advantage where the game is winnable, NEGLIGIBLE
advantage overall — where against the FIXED public hash the same shape wins with probability `1`.
Sampling the oracle after the adversary is fixed is what does the work. -/
