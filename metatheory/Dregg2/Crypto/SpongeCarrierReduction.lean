# `Dregg2.Crypto.SpongeCarrierReduction` — the ONE-FELT SPONGE reduction spine.

## What this is for

`Circuit.InjectiveFloorRegrounded` gave the WIDE (8-lane) carriers a security reduction: a forgery as a
`Game`, an extractor as a map of adversaries, an unconditional advantage inequality, and the conclusion
under `FloorGames.HashCRHardQuant`. `Market.WideCommitBoundary` then discharged the efficiency
obligation with `CostTactics.poly_time`, so `hEff` stopped being a floating parameter.

The ~1-felt sponge carriers never got that treatment. Dozens of deployed bindings across the umem/heap,
cap-root, rotation, membership and accumulator lanes are still stated as

    theorem X_binds (hash : List ℤ → ℤ) (hCR : Poseidon2SpongeCR hash) … : a = b

and `Poseidon2SpongeCR` is **FALSE at deployed BabyBear parameters** —
`Circuit.HashFloorHonesty.poseidon2SpongeCR_false_babyBear`: the sponge lands in one bounded field
while `List ℤ` is infinite, so collisions exist by pigeonhole. Every such theorem is **VACUOUSLY TRUE
at the deployed hash**: it is a true implication whose hypothesis nothing deployed satisfies, and
`#assert_axioms` cannot see it, because the proofs are clean and the HYPOTHESIS is the flaw.

This module is the shared spine that lets each of those sites be rebuilt as a real reduction, ONCE,
instead of forty times.

## The shape

  * **§1 — `SpongeKeyed`**: the deployed unkeyed sponge together with its domain-separation tag space.
    Keying is the standard keyed-from-unkeyed model: an unkeyed fixed hash lets an adversary hardcode a
    known collision (advantage `1`), so the collision game must sample something. The deployed "key" is
    the domain-separation tag the prover already absorbs ahead of each message.
    `spongeFamily` lifts it to a `HashFloorHonesty.KeyedHashFamily`, and `deployedSponge_is_family_instance`
    pins that the family's instance at `deployedTag` IS the function the prover computes — `rfl`.

    ⚑ This is the SAME OBJECT as `Circuit.Poseidon2KeyedBridge.DomainSeparatedSponge`, not a
    re-derivation of it. It is restated here only because `Poseidon2KeyedBridge` sits ABOVE
    `Circuit.OodCommitmentBinding` in the import graph (via `FloorRegroundedConsumers`), and
    `OodCommitmentBinding` is one of the sites that has to consume this spine. The identification is
    PROVED, not asserted, in `Dregg2.Crypto.SpongeCarrierBridge`
    (`spongeFamily_ofDomainSeparated`, by `rfl`), so nothing here is a mirror of an interface — it is
    the same interface, reachable from lower down.

  * **§2 — `SpongeCarrier`**: what a deployed 1-felt commitment site must supply, and the ONLY thing it
    must supply. A context `Ctx` both claims agree on (a Merkle index and sibling path, a turn, an
    address list — whatever the deployment fixes), a payload `Val` the commitment is supposed to BIND,
    the commitment `enc`, and — the real content — a **collision extractor** `find` with its spec:
    two DISTINCT payloads carrying the SAME commitment yield two DISTINCT lists on which the sponge
    genuinely collides. That is a total function and an unconditional theorem; it assumes nothing.

  * **§3 — the reduction**: `carrierBreakGame` (the forgery, with the break IN the win relation),
    `carrierBreakToFinder` (the extractor AS A MAP OF ADVERSARIES), `carrier_adv_le` (the advantage
    inequality — note the adversary class does NOT appear in it), and
    `carrier_binds_advantage_bound` (the security conclusion under `HashCRHardQuant (spongeFamily D) Eff`).

  * **§4 — the answer-size cost model** (`carrierAnsSize`/`spongeAnsSize`): the honest record of what
    that model prices. ⚑ The `IsPolyTime` discharge that stood here is DELETED — see the SUPERSEDED
    section below; the discharged successor is `RomBindingReduction.romCarrier_binds`.

  * **§5 — both poles, and the canary.** `Eff := ⊤` is FALSE at real BabyBear parameters
    (`carrierFloor_top_false_babyBear`); `Eff := ⊥` is vacuous (`carrierFloor_bot_vacuous`); the class
    at which §4 instantiates is PROVED INHABITED (`carrierFloor_isPolyTime_inhabited`) while the
    ⊤-collapse witness is PROVED EXCLUDED (`CostAdversary.bruteForce_not_polyTime`). The canary
    (`the_carrier_bound_needs_the_extracted_finder`) reds if a future edit lets the conclusion follow
    from the floor applied at some OTHER adversary.

## ⚑ The `_from_polyTime` discharges are DELETED (07-24); the successor is LANDED

`Exec.SystemRootsBindingReduction.sysRoots_floor_polyTime_false_babyBear` REFUTES
`HashCRHardQuant (spongeFamily D) (IsPolyTime (spongeAnsSize D))` at the deployed sponge, so §4's
`carrier_binds_from_polyTime` (and §6's `idCarrier_binds_from_polyTime` inhabitation form) were
VACUOUS at deployed parameters — and `Crypto.RomBindingReduction`'s header proves the fixed-function
game cannot be repaired by ANY `Eff`.  BOTH ARE DELETED.  The DISCHARGED successor is
`Crypto.RomBindingReduction.romCarrier_binds` on the PROVED keyed-ROM floor (with
`Crypto.RomCarrierSites` as the per-site kit), and the inhabitation witness the deleted
`idCarrier_binds_from_polyTime` supplied lives there as `RomBindingReduction.idRomCarrier_binds`
(the identity carrier fires end-to-end on the proved floor).  Every deployed consumer is re-pointed
(SystemRoots §7, Heap §2.4, FloorRegroundedConsumers, OodCommitmentBinding, the `Emit/*` sites).
§4's answer-size encodings and both-poles teeth remain as the honest record of what the answer-size
cost model can and cannot price; the `_advantage_bound` forms (`hEff` in the open) stay the honest
fixed-hash statements.

## What this does NOT buy

The reduction does not make the deployed sponge collision-resistant, and it does not close the gap
between the exact-Prop AIR layer and the computational game layer (the game samples a tag; a deployed
trace fixes `deployedTag`). What it buys is exact: the residual is ONE named floor over EFFICIENT
adversaries with both poles proved, in place of a hypothesis that is false at the deployed hash. A
`binds ∨ collides` disjunction would not be enough either — a collision EXISTS by pigeonhole, so that
disjunction is satisfiable through its right branch without binding ever holding. It quantifies over
SOLUTIONS; hardness quantifies over EFFICIENT ADVERSARIES. Hence a game, not a disjunction.

No `sorry`, no `axiom`, no `native_decide`, no `decide` on an opaque `Prop`. Cost stays SYNTACTIC.

/-! ## §2 — what a deployed 1-felt commitment site supplies: an EXTRACTOR, and nothing else.

The per-site content of every rebuilt binding is one total function and one unconditional theorem
about it. Note what is NOT here: no collision-resistance hypothesis, no injectivity, no floor. The
extractor is where the old proof's combinatorics go — the induction that used to peel a CR hypothesis
now LOCATES the colliding pair instead of assuming it away. -/

/-- **`IsSpongeColl h p`** — the pair `p` is a genuine collision of `h`: two DISTINCT lists with the
same digest. The extractor's postcondition, and definitionally the collision game's win relation. -/
def IsSpongeColl (h : List ℤ → ℤ) (p : List ℤ × List ℤ) : Prop :=
  p.1 ≠ p.2 ∧ h p.1 = h p.2

/-- **A DEPLOYED 1-FELT COMMITMENT CARRIER, with its collision extractor.**

`Ctx` is what both claims agree on and the deployment fixes (a Merkle index and sibling path, a turn,
a declared address list); `Val` is the payload the commitment is supposed to BIND; `enc` is the
deployed commitment. The load-bearing field is `find` with `find_spec`: given two DISTINCT payloads
that carry the SAME commitment, it RETURNS two distinct lists on which the sponge actually collides.

`find_spec` is unconditional — it assumes nothing about `h` at all, so unlike the binding it replaces
it is a true theorem at deployed BabyBear parameters. `size`/`outCo`/`outBo`/`find_len_le` are the
cost model's output-growth obligation: the extractor must not blow up its input, or the reduction
would not preserve efficiency. That fact is PROVED per site, never assumed. -/

  yield a genuine collision of the sponge. No floor, no injectivity, no hypothesis on `h`. -/
  find_spec : ∀ (h : List ℤ → ℤ) (c : Ctx) (a b : Val), a ≠ b → enc h c a = enc h c b →
    IsSpongeColl h (find h c a b)

    (find h c a b).1.length + (find h c a b).2.length ≤ outCo * (size c a + size c b) + outBo

/-- **THE COMMONEST CARRIER SHAPE — a flat, injectively-encoded preimage.** Most deployed 1-felt
commitments are `hash (encode v)` for a STRUCTURAL encoding that is injective on the nose: a fixed
tuple of felts laid out in a fixed order (`hash [holder, target, rights, op]`,
`hash [domain_tag, coll, key]`, `hash [addr, value]`, …). For those the extractor is simply the two
encodings, and the old CR-peeling proof — `hCR _ _ h` followed by `List.cons.injEq` as many times as
the arity — collapses into `encode_inj`, which is pure combinatorics and carries no floor.

⚑ Note what moved. The old proofs used collision-resistance to invert the HASH. Here injectivity is
required only of the ENCODING, which is a layout fact the deployment genuinely satisfies, and the
hash's contribution is priced by the reduction instead of assumed. -/

/-! ## §3 — the reduction: the forgery as a GAME, the extractor as a MAP OF ADVERSARIES. -/

/-- **THE CARRIER FORGERY GAME.** The adversary is handed a uniformly sampled domain-separation tag and
WINS iff it outputs a context and two DISTINCT payloads carrying the SAME deployed commitment — i.e. it
equivocates the very commitment the circuit publishes. The break is IN the win relation; this is the
statement the old `X_binds` was trying to make, with the quantifier over efficient adversaries that
cryptographic hardness actually has. -/

/-- **THE EXTRACTOR, AS A MAP OF ADVERSARIES.** A commitment equivocator becomes a sponge-collision
finder by running the carrier's extractor on its own output. This is the reduction; `find_spec` is why
it works, and it works at every tag, unconditionally. -/

    (A : Adversary (carrierBreakGame D C)) : Adversary (hashGame (spongeFamily D)) where
  run := fun l t => let p := A.run l t; C.find (D.hashAt t) p.1 p.2.1 p.2.2

/-- **⚑ WIN-PRESERVATION — the reduction, at the game level.** Every tag on which the equivocator wins,
the extracted finder wins the collision game of the DEPLOYED sponge. -/

/-- **⚑ THE ADVANTAGE INEQUALITY — UNCONDITIONAL, over ALL adversaries.** The equivocator's advantage
is at most the extracted collision finder's, at every security parameter, over the same sampled tag
space. Note what does NOT appear in this statement: the adversary class. The inequality is a fact
about the extractor, true of every adversary whatsoever; `Eff` enters only when the floor is applied. -/

/-- **⚑ THE REDUCED BINDING — the security conclusion, from the DEPLOYED sponge's collision floor.**

Under the deployed sponge's collision floor at the class `Eff`, a commitment equivocator whose
extracted finder lies in that class has NEGLIGIBLE advantage: the deployed 1-felt commitment binds its
payload except with negligible probability.

This is what replaces `X_binds (hCR : Poseidon2SpongeCR hash)`. The difference is not cosmetic. The old
hypothesis is FALSE at BabyBear, so the old theorem said nothing about the deployed hash; this one
quantifies over efficient adversaries and is priced at both poles in §5.

⚑ `hEff` is a PARAMETER here — the standard "the reduction is efficient", in the open, at an arbitrary
class. §4 DISCHARGES it at `Eff := IsPolyTime`. -/

/-! ## §5 — the floor, PRICED at both poles, plus the canary and the inhabitation tooth. -/

/-- **⚑ THE ⊤ POLE — the floor is FALSE at the REAL BabyBear parameters.** A sponge whose output is a
genuine BabyBear felt (`0 ≤ · < p`, `p = 2³¹ − 2²⁷ + 1`) has finite range while `List ℤ` is infinite,
so a collision exists at every tag and the floor at the UNRESTRICTED class is FALSE.

This is the honest price of `hEff`, stated as a theorem rather than a promise. What the reduction buys
is NOT a floor the deployed sponge satisfies at ⊤ — no such floor exists — it is that the residual is
ONE named class with both poles proved, in place of a hypothesis that is simply false.

⚑ The `⊤` is WRITTEN OUT in the statement. It used to be reachable through
`HashFloorHonesty.CollisionResistant`, which was a spelling of this very proposition; that name is
DELETED (2026-07-28) and the proof now applies `FloorGames.hashCRHardQuant_top_false_of_compressing`
directly, with no intermediate rewrite hiding which adversary class is in play. -/

The identity commitment `enc h _ v = h v` on `List ℤ` payloads: an equivocation IS a collision, so the
