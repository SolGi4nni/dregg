# `Dregg2.Crypto.VrfRegrounded` — the lattice LB-VRF UNIQUENESS keystone, CARRYING its reduction.

## What this file says

A validator that double-claims a committee seat is one that produces two DISTINCT short outputs `y₁ ≠ y₂`
with short proofs that both verify against the same public key and the same per-input commitment. That is
`vrfUniqGame`: a first-class adversary against a λ-indexed sampled LB-VRF instance, whose win relation IS
`VRF.latticeVerify` twice over. `lattice_vrf_uniqueness_advantage_bound` bounds its advantage under the
Module-SIS floor at the AUGMENTED map `[A | t]` — the object the reduction actually attacks.

The Boolean "two verifying outputs ⟹ equal" becomes "⟹ equal EXCEPT with negligible probability".

## The reduction is IN the statement — which is the whole point of this file's 2026-07-16 rewrite

`VRF.lattice_vrf_uniqueness_reduces_to_msis` turns two distinct short verifying outputs on a shared
commitment into a genuine `Lattice.IsMSISSolution` of `[A | t]`: the difference `(z₁ − z₂, −(y₁ − y₂))`,
nonzero from the OUTPUT coordinate, short by the triangle inequality, in the kernel because the extractor
cancels the shared commitment. That theorem was ALWAYS real. Until 07-16 it was not in this file's
statements — it was in this file's PROSE, while the theorem said

    (adv : S → Ensemble) (s : S) (hfloor : MSISHardQuantShape adv) : Negl (adv s)

whose proof is `hfloor s`, and which `HardQuantVacuity.the_vrf_keystone_accepts_the_hash_floor` discharged
by passing the POSEIDON2 COLLISION floor into the slot marked `MSISHardQuant`. It typechecked, because the
five `*HardQuant` floors were one content-free `Prop`. See `docs/deos/VACUITY-SWEEP.md` Finding 1.

Now the reduction is a chain of proof terms:

  * `uniqBreakToMsisSolver` — the extractor, as a map from uniqueness-breakers to MSIS solvers;
  * `uniqBreak_reduces_to_msis` — win preservation, which IS `lattice_vrf_uniqueness_reduces_to_msis` applied;
  * `uniqBreak_adv_le_msis_adv` — the advantage inequality, by `winProb_le_of_imp` over the shared
    instance space;
  * `lattice_vrf_uniqueness_advantage_bound` — the floor, applied to the EXTRACTED solver, dominated down.

Delete the reduction and the keystone does not follow: hypothesis and conclusion are now about DIFFERENT
games, and §2's canary compiles that fact (`fail_if_success` on `hfloor B hB`). Under the old statement
that canary was unwritable — hypothesis and conclusion were the same `Negl (adv s)`.

## The floor, and what it costs — read this before citing the keystone

`FloorGames.MSISHardQuant (vrfMsisFamily F) Eff` is the standard Module-SIS game at the augmented map, with
`IsMSISSolution` in the win relation. `Eff` is the adversary class, and it is a PARAMETER: this tree has no
cost model (`FloorGames` §8). Both poles are proved rather than promised — `Eff := ⊤` makes the floor FALSE
at compressing parameters (`lattice_vrf_floor_top_false_of_compressing`, which is why MSIS is a hard SEARCH
problem), `Eff := ⊥` makes it vacuous (`lattice_vrf_floor_satisfiable_vacuously`). The keystone's `hEff`
side condition — "the extracted solver is in the class" — is the standard "the reduction is efficient". It
is UNDISCHARGED, it is a named parameter at the use site, and it is the honest remaining gap.

## Axiom hygiene

`#assert_all_clean` (⊆ {propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}); no `sorry`, no fresh `axiom`, no
`native_decide`. The Boolean-floor consumer `VRF.lattice_vrf_unique_under_msis` is KEPT untouched.

## Coordination

Lattice search-floor leg. The signature forking `MSISHard` consumers ride `Crypto.ForkingDischarge`; those
are NOT re-grounded — no reduction in the tree connects `forkProb` to an `MSISFamily` adversary's advantage,
and `ThreadAdvantageBound` §4 names that obligation rather than dressing it. Stays in the VRF subtree.

## ⚑ NO KEYED-ROM SUCCESSOR EXISTS FOR THIS FLOOR — named, not dodged (2026-07-24)

The 07-24 keyed-ROM re-pointing campaign (`Crypto.KeyedRomFloor.keyedRom_hard` → the birthday bound)
DISCHARGES the hash-collision floors of the sibling `*Regrounded` files. It does NOT apply here, and
saying why precisely is the honest state: `keyedRom_hard` is a COLLISION bound for a SAMPLED oracle —
an information-theoretic birthday fact. The uniqueness break above extracts an `IsMSISSolution` of the
PUBLIC augmented map `[A | t]` — a short-vector SEARCH problem over a GIVEN linear map, not a
collision of anything sampled-after-the-adversary; no query-counted oracle model makes finding short
kernel vectors of a KNOWN map a theorem (the map is public — the analogue of
`RomBindingReduction`'s "collision resistance of a FIXED function is a conjecture" applies verbatim).
The honest successor would be a COST-CARRYING lattice floor (a deep-embedded adversary with real cost
semantics, `Eff := PolyTime` as a theorem-bearing class — the EasyCrypt/FCF-style grounding), which
this tree does not yet have. Until it does, `hfloor : MSISHardQuant (vrfMsisFamily F) Eff` stays a
NAMED, undischarged parameter with both poles priced (§3) — carried in the open, not laundered
through a floor that cannot ground it. -/

/-! ## §1 — the uniqueness keystone, ROUTED THROUGH THE REAL REDUCTION.

The 07-16 vacuity sweep proved the previous version of this section carried no lattice content: its
statement was `(adv) (s) (hfloor : MSISHardQuantShape adv) : Negl (adv s)`, whose proof is `hfloor s`, and
`HardQuantVacuity.the_vrf_keystone_accepts_the_hash_floor` discharged it by passing a POSEIDON2 COLLISION
floor into the slot. The reduction this file's own header cited —
`VRF.lattice_vrf_uniqueness_reduces_to_msis` — is real, and was simply never in the statement.

It is now. The uniqueness-breaking adversary is a first-class object (`vrfUniqGame`), the reduction MAPS it
to an MSIS solver (`uniqBreakToMsisSolver`, whose output IS the extractor's `(z₁ − z₂, −(y₁ − y₂))`), the
map is PROVED win-preserving (`uniqBreak_reduces_to_msis`, which is the extractor theorem applied), and the
advantage inequality follows by monotonicity of `winProb`. The floor then bites on the EXTRACTED solver, at
the MSIS game of the AUGMENTED map — the object the reduction actually attacks. -/

/-- **⚑ RE-GROUNDED LATTICE-VRF UNIQUENESS — from MSIS hardness, VIA the reduction.**

Under the MSIS floor at the AUGMENTED family the reduction attacks, a uniqueness-breaking adversary whose
extracted solver is in the floor's adversary class has NEGLIGIBLE advantage: a validator double-claims a
committee seat only with negligible probability. The Boolean "two verifying outputs ⟹ equal" becomes
"⟹ equal except with negligible probability", and — unlike its predecessor — this statement is FALSE if
you delete the reduction: the conclusion is about the VRF game, the hypothesis about the MSIS game, and
`uniqBreak_adv_le_msis_adv` is the only bridge.

⚑ **THE `hEff` OBLIGATION IS UNDISCHARGED AND THAT IS THE HONEST STATE.** `hEff` says the extracted MSIS
solver is in the class the floor quantifies over — the standard side condition "the reduction is
efficient". It is trivial for the class the reduction preserves and unprovable in general, because this
tree has no cost model (`FloorGames` §8). It is a PARAMETER here, in the open, at the use site. It is NOT a
costume: `FloorGames.hard_top_iff_solvableFrac_negl` proves that filling it with `⊤` makes the floor false
and `hard_bot_vacuous` that filling it with `⊥` makes it vacuous, so the reader can price it exactly. -/

hypothesis. Two teeth, both negative, both permanent. -/

the VRF adversary's negligibility from the MSIS floor applied at some OTHER solver — and the proof does not
go through: the floor bounds the extracted solver, and only `uniqBreak_adv_le_msis_adv` connects that to
the VRF game. Under the OLD statement this tooth was impossible to write: hypothesis and conclusion were
the same `Negl (adv s)`, so `hfloor s` closed it. Here `exact hfloor B hB` cannot: it proves `Negl` of the
WRONG advantage. -/
