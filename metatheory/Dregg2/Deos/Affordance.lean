# Dregg2.Deos.Affordance — an agent fires only the affordances its caps authorize (leg 4 of the crown).

`docs/deos/DEOS.md` §"the verified-deos program", target 4 (**Affordance soundness**):

  > A cell-affordance interaction is a verified turn; prove an agent can only fire affordances its caps
  > authorize (gateOK on the affordance effect-template), and the post-state surface binds the attested
  > root.

`docs/deos/DEOS.md` §"htmx on crack": a `CellAffordance` is a named `dregg_turn::Effect` template, "the
render/fire gate is the GENUINE `is_attenuation` (`required ⊆ held`, the proven lattice — not a new
gate)", "an unauthorized fire is REFUSED in-band, an authorized one yields a verified-turn
`AffordanceIntent`". The realization is `starbridge-web-surface::affordance` (15 module tests); this is
the proof.

## ⚑ FLAG DAY 2026-08-07 — the attested-root binding was an IDENTITY CARRIER; `fire` changed shape.

The previous `fire` built its receipt as `let _receipt : Receipt := mkReceipt 0 s post aff.name` —
**underscore-prefixed and DISCARDED** — and then set the surface's `boundRoot := post` from the same
free `post` the caller handed in. `firedSurface_binds_attested_root` re-derived
`mkReceipt 0 s post aff.name` *in its own statement* and concluded `boundRoot = that.newCommit`, i.e.
**`post = post`**. Nothing was attested. Three further defects rode along:

  * `effectsHash := aff.name` — the receipt committed to the affordance's **display name**, not to the
    effect. Two affordances with one name produced byte-identical receipts (see
    `docs/audit` / the display-name-collision class); the thing that fired was not bound at all.
  * `prevHash := 0` (= `genesisSentinel`) — **every** fire's receipt claimed to be genesis, so no fire
    could ever be linked into the receipt chain the tamper-evidence law speaks about.
  * `post : Nat` was a **free parameter the verifier consumed** — an over-naming, in the sense of
    `minted-over-naming-migrates-into-transcript-geometry`: the caller chose the attested root.

The repair: `fire` takes a `FireCtx` (a §8 **effect digest**, the prior chain head's digest, and the
pre/post commitments), **produces a real `Receipt` and RETURNS it** in the `AffordanceIntent`, and the
post-state surface binds **that receipt's** `newCommit`. Everything downstream of `fire`
(`Deos.GatedAffordance`, `Deos.Reactive`) re-emits against the new shape; the old `(s post : Nat)`
argument pair no longer exists and a call in the old shape does not typecheck.

## What is proven

  * `fireGate required held` — the affordance gate: `required ⊆ held` (the genuine `is_attenuation`,
    decidable). Reflexive; transitive along projection.
  * `fire aff held fc` — the fire dispatch: iff `held` authorizes `aff.required`, yields an
    `AffordanceIntent` carrying the REAL effect, the RECEIPT the turn produced, and the post-state
    surface bound to that receipt's `newCommit`; otherwise `none` (refused in-band).
  * `fire_authorized_iff` — ⓘ **DEFINITIONAL** (it is `(if c then some _ else none).isSome ↔ c`, the
    shape of `fire`). The content lives one step out, in `fire_authorized_iff_subset`.
  * **`fire_authorized_iff_subset` (KEYSTONE)** — a fire commits IFF `aff.required ⊆ held`, the
    ORDER RELATION on rights (not the boolean gate restated). Rides `fireGate_iff_subset`, which is a
    real `List.all`/membership proof, not `rfl`.
  * **`firedSurface_binds_attested_root`** — the post-state surface's `boundRoot` equals
    **`intent.receipt.newCommit`** — the receipt the fire ACTUALLY produced and RETURNED, not one the
    statement re-derives.
  * **`firedReceipt_commits_to_effect`** — the receipt's `effectsHash` is the §8 digest of the effect
    that fired (never the display name).
  * **`firedReceipt_determines_effect` (the attestation with teeth)** — under the NAMED §8 hypothesis
    that the effect digest is injective, two committed fires with the SAME receipt fired the SAME
    effect. The receipt binds *what happened*. `determines_effect_needs_injectivity` proves the
    hypothesis is load-bearing: with a degenerate (constant) digest the conclusion is FALSE.
  * **`firedReceipt_extends_chain`** — the produced receipt links onto a well-linked chain
    (`Exec.Receipts.wellLinked_append`), so a fire is an append to the real receipt log rather than a
    free-floating genesis claim.
  * `unauthorized_fire_refused` / `unauthorized_fire_no_surface` — fail-closed, anti-ghost.
  * `projectFor_monotone` / `projectFor_all_fireable` — progressive enhancement → progressive
    ATTENUATION.

## Non-vacuity (registered, `metatheory/CLAIMS.md` §Deos)

`firedSurface_binds_attested_root_satisfiable` (fires: a concrete committed fire, root ≠ pre-state,
effectsHash = the real effect's digest) · `firedReceipt_determines_effect_bites` (bites: two
affordances with DIFFERENT effects produce DIFFERENT receipts) · `determines_effect_needs_injectivity`
(the §8 hypothesis is not droppable).

Discipline: axiom-clean (`#assert_all_clean` at the close). The fire gate IS `required ⊆ held`; the
attested root IS the EXISTING `Receipts.Receipt.newCommit`. No new gate, no new commitment. The effect
digest is a §8 portal (a hypothesis, never a Lean axiom), exactly as `Receipt`'s chain digest `H` is.

/-! ## §1 — The affordance gate IS `is_attenuation` (`required ⊆ held`).

The render/fire gate is the GENUINE `is_attenuation` — `required ⊆ held`, the SAME lattice the cap
crown proves (`Dregg2.Exec.attenuate_subset` narrows ALONG it; here it GATES). We use the decidable
`required.all (held.contains ·)` form and bridge it to `List.Subset`. NO new gate. -/

/-- **`fireGate required held`** — may an agent holding `held` rights fire an affordance requiring
`required`? Iff `required ⊆ held` — the genuine `is_attenuation` (`required ⊆ held`, the Rust
`cell/src/capability.rs:461` order), decidable as `required.all (held.contains ·)`. This is NOT a new
gate: it is the SAME subset order the cap crown's attenuation narrows along. -/
def fireGate (required held : List Auth) : Bool := required.all (fun a => held.contains a)

/-- **The gate IS the subset relation** — `fireGate required held = true ↔ required ⊆ held`. Ties the
decidable gate to the `List.Subset` the lattice laws speak in, so the affordance gate is literally
`is_attenuation`, not a look-alike. This is the file's one genuinely non-definitional gate lemma; every
"an agent fires only what it may" statement below routes through it. -/

/-! ## §2 — A `CellAffordance`: a named effect-template carrying a REAL effect.

A `CellAffordance` is the deos "htmx on crack" element — a named `dregg_turn::Effect` template, gated
by `required` rights. The effect type `φ` is abstract (so ANY real effect fits — the
`starbridge-web-surface` realization carries a `dregg_turn::Effect`); the affordance carries a REAL
`effect : φ`, not a stand-in. -/

variable {φ : Type}

/-- **`CellAffordance φ`** — a named, cap-gated effect-template: the rights `required` to fire it, plus
the REAL `effect : φ` it carries (the `dregg_turn::Effect`). The "button" of the deos surface — and
who may press it is decided by `required ⊆ held`, not a session cookie.

⚠ `name` is a DISPLAY LABEL and nothing else. It is deliberately NOT what the receipt commits to (see
`FireCtx.effectDigest`): display names collide, and the previous version of this module committed the
name in place of the effect. -/

  /-- The rights an agent must hold to fire this affordance (the `is_attenuation` template). -/
  required : List Auth
  /-- The REAL effect this affordance fires — abstract so any `dregg_turn::Effect` fits. -/

deriving DecidableEq

/-- **`FireCtx φ`** — everything a verified turn needs that the affordance itself does not carry.
Threaded, not invented: the caller supplies the turn context, and `fire` builds the receipt from it.

  * `effectDigest` — the **§8 portal**: a commitment to the effect that fires. Exactly the same kind of
    object as `Dregg2.Exec.Receipts`'s chain digest `H` (a parameter, with its collision-resistance
    entering downstream theorems as a NAMED `Function.Injective` hypothesis — never a Lean axiom).
  * `prevDigest` — `H` of the receipt this turn chains onto (`genesisSentinel` only at genesis).
  * `pre` / `post` — the state commitments before/after the turn (`oldCommit` / `newCommit`). -/

  pre          : Nat
  /-- The state commitment AFTER the turn (the receipt's `newCommit`). -/
  post         : Nat

/-- **`FiredSurface φ`** — the post-state surface a committed fire yields: the REAL effect that fired
plus the attested root it bound. The `boundRoot` is set from the PRODUCED receipt's `newCommit`
(`fire`, §3) — it is not a field the caller fills in. -/
structure FiredSurface (φ : Type) where

that fired, **the receipt the turn produced**, and the resulting attested post-state surface.
(`docs/deos/DEOS.md`: "an authorized one yields a verified-turn `AffordanceIntent`".)

⚑ The `receipt` field is the flag-day repair: the previous version discarded the receipt into a
`let _receipt`, which is why its root-binding theorem reduced to `post = post`. -/

deriving DecidableEq

/-! ## §3 — `fire`: the cap-gated, receipt-producing dispatch.

`fire aff held fc` runs the affordance ONLY when `held` authorizes `aff.required` (`fireGate`), and on
commit BUILDS the verified turn's receipt from `fc` — linking onto `fc.prevDigest`, carrying
`fc.pre → fc.post`, and committing to `fc.effectDigest aff.effect` — then binds the post-state surface
to THAT receipt's `newCommit`. An unauthorized fire is REFUSED in-band (`none`). -/

/-- **`receiptOf fc aff`** — the receipt a fire of `aff` under `fc` produces: `prevHash = fc.prevDigest`
(the append-only link), `oldCommit → newCommit = fc.pre → fc.post`, and `effectsHash =
fc.effectDigest aff.effect` — a commitment to the EFFECT, not to `aff.name`. -/
def receiptOf (fc : FireCtx φ) (aff : CellAffordance φ) : Receipt :=
  mkReceipt fc.prevDigest fc.pre fc.post (fc.effectDigest aff.effect)

/-- **`fire aff held fc`** — fire affordance `aff` for an agent holding `held` rights in turn context
`fc`. IF `fireGate aff.required held` (the agent's caps authorize the affordance), yields `some` of the
verified-turn `AffordanceIntent` carrying the produced receipt and a surface bound to that receipt's
`newCommit`; ELSE `none` (refused in-band). The `gateOK`-on-the-affordance-template dispatch. -/

/-- ⓘ **DEFINITIONAL — this is the SHAPE of `fire`, not a security property.** `fire` is
`if fireGate … then some _ else none`, so this theorem is `(if c then some _ else none).isSome ↔ c`.
It is true, it is `#assert_axioms`-clean, and it says only that the `if` is the `if`. **The content is
`fire_authorized_iff_subset`** (immediately below), which relates the dispatch to the ORDER on rights
through the non-definitional `fireGate_iff_subset`. Kept because downstream modules
(`Deos.GatedAffordance`, `Deos.Reactive`) route their own gate proofs through it. -/

/-- **THE KEYSTONE — `fire_authorized_iff_subset`.** A fire COMMITS if and only if the affordance's
required rights are a SUBSET of the rights the agent holds — the `is_attenuation` ORDER itself, not the
boolean gate restated. Both polarities: an agent whose held rights cover `required` fires; one whose do
not is REFUSED. So an agent can fire ONLY the affordances its caps authorize — target 4's first clause,
against the lattice the cap crown proves on. (Routes through `fireGate_iff_subset`, whose proof is a
real `List.all`/membership argument.) -/

  · rw [if_neg hg] at h; exact absurd h (by simp)

/-- **A COMMITTED FIRE RETURNS THE RECEIPT IT PRODUCED** — the intent's `receipt` is exactly
`receiptOf fc aff`. This is the fact the previous version could not state, because the receipt was
discarded into a `let _receipt`. -/
theorem fire_returns_receipt (aff : CellAffordance φ) (held : List Auth) (fc : FireCtx φ)

/-- **THE POST-STATE SURFACE BINDS THE ATTESTED ROOT** — target 4's second clause, repaired. When
`fire` commits, the surface's `boundRoot` EQUALS **the `newCommit` of the receipt the intent carries** —
the receipt this fire produced and returned, not one the statement re-derives from the same free
variable. So the fragment the witness-graph records is pinned to the commitment of the turn that
actually ran.

⚠ **Say what this is and is not.** It is still a STRUCTURAL AGREEMENT between two fields of the
returned intent, and its proof is `rfl` once the `some` is destructed. What changed is that it is now
**refutable**: an implementation that bound `fc.pre`, or a root the receipt did not produce, makes it
FALSE — whereas the old statement re-derived its own right-hand side from the caller's free `post` and
was satisfied by an implementation with no receipt at all. The load-bearing content of "the surface
binds an ATTESTED root" lives in the three theorems below it —
`firedReceipt_commits_to_effect`, `firedReceipt_extends_chain`, `firedReceipt_determines_effect` —
which say what the receipt commits to, that it is linked, and that it pins what fired. -/

/-- **THE RECEIPT COMMITS TO THE EFFECT THAT FIRED** — its `effectsHash` is the §8 digest of

/-- **THE FIRE'S RECEIPT EXTENDS THE REAL CHAIN** — given a well-linked chain whose head digests to
`fc.prevDigest`, prepending the produced receipt keeps it well-linked
(`Dregg2.Exec.Receipts.wellLinked_append`). So an affordance fire is an APPEND to the append-only
receipt log, inheriting `chain_tamper_evident`; it is not a free-floating genesis claim. ⚠ The previous
version hard-coded `prevHash := 0 = genesisSentinel`, under which this statement is unprovable for any
non-empty chain (`HFresh` forbids it). -/

that the effect digest is injective — the same kind of obligation `chain_tamper_evident` carries as

that produced the SAME receipt fired the SAME effect. So a receipt cannot be re-presented as evidence
of a different interaction: the post-state surface's attested root is bound to *what happened*.

/-- **FIRES (non-vacuity of `firedSurface_binds_attested_root`).** A concrete authorized fire COMMITS,
and its conclusion is EXERCISED on that instance: the surface's bound root is the produced receipt's
`newCommit`, the receipt commits to the REAL effect's digest (not to `aff.name = 1`), it anchors at the
pre-state and the prior chain digest, and the bound root is genuinely NOT the pre-state. Every conjunct
is about the receipt the fire RETURNED. -/

/-- **BITES (the binding is two-valued).** Two affordances with DIFFERENT effects, fired in the SAME
turn context by the SAME viewer, produce DIFFERENT receipts — so `firedReceipt_determines_effect` is
refutable in the only way that matters: swap the effect and the attestation changes. (Under the OLD
`effectsHash := aff.name` these two would still differ only because their *names* differ — rename
either and the receipts collide while the effects do not. The digest closes that.) -/
theorem firedReceipt_determines_effect_bites :

/-- **THE §8 HYPOTHESIS IS LOAD-BEARING** (`firedReceipt_determines_effect` is NOT PROVABLE without
`hinj`). Under a DEGENERATE constant effect digest, two committed fires of affordances with DIFFERENT
effects produce IDENTICAL receipts — so the conclusion `aff₁.effect = aff₂.effect` is FALSE. The
injectivity obligation cannot be dropped, and a digest that fails it makes the attestation meaningless
rather than merely weaker. -/
