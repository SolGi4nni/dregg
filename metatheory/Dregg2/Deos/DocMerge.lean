# Dregg2.Deos.DocMerge — the dreggverse DOCUMENT merge is the least-upper-bound JOIN (the
# colimit-by-union the Pijul pushout computes), with the FAITHFUL `Dead`-wins status join,
# TRANSITIVE-reachability conflicts, and a conflict as a FIRST-CLASS STATE.

`docs/deos/DOCUMENT-LANGUAGE.md` §2.1–2.4 + §4.4 RESEARCH. Differential target: the Rust crate
`dregg-doc` (`/Users/ember/dev/breadstuffs/dregg-doc/src/{graph,merge,content,atom}.rs`).

**Faithfulness note (this file was rebuilt to BE faithful, three audited gaps fixed).**

  1. **The status-join gap (severe).** An earlier draft modelled the atom store as a `Finset Atom`
     and unioned whole structs — which never applied the `Dead`-wins status join, so merging an id
     alive on one side and dead on the other produced a TWO-element set, a state the Rust
     `BTreeMap<AtomId, Atom>` cannot represent. THE FIX (here): the atom store is a KEYED MAP
     `AtomId → Option AtomVal` (the `BTreeMap`), and `merge` applies `Status.join` POINTWISE on
     shared ids — exactly `graph.rs::union_in_place`'s
     `.and_modify(|a| a.status = a.status.join(other.status)).or_insert(...)` (graph.rs:274–280).
     `merge_status_dead_wins` is the proof the old model could not even STATE.

  2. **The one-hop-conflict gap.** The earlier `OrderedBefore`/`ConflictAt` used one-hop edge
     membership; `content.rs::reachable` (content.rs:340) is a TRANSITIVE closure (reflexive on
     `start == target`, then a graph walk over `successors`). THE FIX: `Reaches g a b` is
     `Relation.ReflTransGen` of the edge relation `(·,·) ∈ g.order`; `ConflictAt` is MUTUAL
     non-reachability — a genuine transitive antichain matching `content.rs::walk` (content.rs:251).

  3. **The pushout overclaim.** The earlier docstrings called this "THE categorical pushout up to
     unique iso" — but the content is `Finset.union_subset`: the LATTICE JOIN / LUB. THE FIX: it is
     stated HONESTLY as "`merge a b` is the least upper bound (join) in the document inclusion order
     `⊑` — the colimit-by-union the pushout computes in the Pijul model." The residual is NAMED:
     building the actual category `P`, the span `a ← a⊓b → b`, functoriality — NOT done here.

**The content-abstraction (why dropping `payload` is FAITHFUL, not a cheat).** The merge never
inspects an atom's content or provenance: `union_in_place` JOINS `status` and, for an already-present
id, KEEPS the existing entry untouched (`and_modify` only touches `status`; graph.rs:277). So the
merge-observable value of an atom is JUST its `status`. Content + provenance are bound by the
COMMITMENT layer (`commit.rs`/`substrate.rs`), NOT the merge-algebra — so `AtomVal := Status` is
exactly what `merge` observes. This also removes the spurious content-addressing invariant the
old `payload`-carrying model needed to prove `atomJoin` commutative.

**The model, faithful to `dregg-doc`:**
  * `DocGraph` — `atoms : AtomId → Option AtomVal` (the keyed `BTreeMap`; ≤1 status per id BY
    CONSTRUCTION), `order : Finset (AtomId × AtomId)` (the edge set), `fields : Name → Finset Val`
    (the keyed single-valued store). (`graph.rs::DocGraph`.)
  * `merge` — pointwise: atoms join by `Option`-lifted `Status.join` (DEAD WINS, the real
    `union_in_place`), order ∪, fields ∪. (`merge.rs` = `graph.rs::union_in_place`.)
  * **THE JOIN LAWS**, now about the REAL status-joining merge: `merge_comm`, `merge_assoc`,
    `merge_idem`, `merge_total`. The status-join is genuinely exercised (`merge_status_dead_wins`).
  * **THE UNIVERSAL PROPERTY (as a lattice join, honestly):** `merge_is_lub` — `merge a b` is the
    least graph including both legs in the inclusion order `⊑` (`merge_includes_left/right` are the
    cocone legs; `merge_least` is leastness). The colimit-by-union the pushout computes.
  * **CONFLICT-AS-STATE.** `ConflictAt` — two distinct LIVE atoms after a shared `p` that are
    mutually UN-`Reaches`able (a transitive antichain, matching `content.rs::walk`).
    `merge_has_conflict` exhibits a concrete two-fork conflict that is a WELL-FORMED `DocGraph`
    (not a failure); `resolve_collapses` — an additive `Connect` makes one reach the other, removing
    the antichain, and is additive (`g ⊑ resolved`).
  * **THE TWO-REGIME SPLIT** (§2.4) connected to `Confluence.IConfluent`: `prose_iconfluent`
    (grow-only liveness survives merge) vs `field_not_iconfluent` (a single-valued field clashes —
    a constructed pair whose merge holds two values at one name).

`#assert_axioms`-clean (⊆ {propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}); NO `sorry`/`:=True`/`native_decide`.
Verified with `lake build Dregg2.Deos.DocMerge`. Differential: `dregg-doc/src/{merge,graph,content,atom}.rs`.

colimit is bracket-independent (merge.rs:18–19). -/

  · simp only [merge_order, Finset.union_assoc]
  · intro n; simp only [merge_fields, Finset.union_assoc]

always exists; the missing order becomes a representable antichain, not a failure; merge.rs:14–15).
This is the catch the graph model fixes: there is no `Option`/error result. -/
theorem merge_total (a b : DocGraph) : ∃ g : DocGraph, g = merge a b := ⟨merge a b, rfl⟩

/-- **`merge_status_dead_wins` (THE STATUS-JOIN, exercised).** If `a` (or `b`) has tombstoned atom
`i` (`a.atoms i = some .dead`), the merged atom is DEAD — regardless of the other side. THIS is the
proof the old `Finset Atom` model could not even STATE: it would have produced a two-element set
{alive, dead} at `i`. Here the keyed map + pointwise `Status.join` gives a SINGLE dead status,
exactly `graph.rs::union_in_place`'s `a.status = a.status.join(other.status)` (graph.rs:277). -/

Honest framing (audit gap #3): this is NOT "the categorical pushout up to unique iso". It is the
LATTICE JOIN — the LEAST UPPER BOUND in the document inclusion order `⊑` — which in the Pijul graph
model is the colimit-by-union the pushout computes. We prove exactly that: `merge a b` includes both
legs (the cocone) and is below any common upper bound (leastness). The RESIDUAL — building the actual
category `P`, the span `a ← a⊓b → b`, functoriality of the inclusion — is NAMED, not claimed. -/

/-- **`Includes g h` (`g ⊑ h`).** Document inclusion: `h` advances past `g`. Pointwise on atoms
(`h`'s atom at each present id of `g` is `≥` in the `alive ≤ dead` order), the order-edges contain
`g`'s, and each field's value-set contains `g`'s. This is the order in which `merge` is the JOIN. -/

/-- **`resolve_collapses` (RESOLUTION).** Adding the edge `1 → 2` makes `Reaches resolved aId bId`
HOLD — so `1` and `2` are no longer mutually non-reachable, the antichain is gone, and `ConflictAt`
fails. AND the resolution is ADDITIVE: `conflictGraph ⊑ resolved` (a `Connect` only grows the graph).
So the conflict is resolved by an ordinary monotone patch, never a destructive rewrite. -/

/-! ## 6. THE TWO-REGIME SPLIT (§2.4) — `prose_iconfluent` vs `field_not_iconfluent`.

`regime.rs` draws the line: the prose/liveness fragment is grow-only and ALWAYS glues by union
(I-confluent); a single-valued field is NOT grow-only and a concurrent clash is a REAL conflict.
We connect both to the shape of `Confluence.IConfluent` (`∀ x y, I x → I y → I (x ⊔ y)`). -/

/-- **`prose_iconfluent` (the I-confluent side).** A grow-only LIVENESS invariant survives merge: if
`I` is monotone in the sense that a present atom's advancing status preserves it, AND `I` holds of
both legs, it holds of the merge. We state the canonical grow-only liveness invariant — "the set of
PRESENT atom-ids only grows" — as the I-confluent property: present-in-`a` and present-in-`b` both
imply present-in-`merge a b`. This is the `Confluence.IConfluent` shape (`I a → I b → I (merge a b)`)
for the prose fragment, the always-glues case (`regime.rs::Regime::Prose`). -/

/-- **`field_not_iconfluent` (the non-monotone boundary).** The single-valued field store is NOT
I-confluent: two graphs each single-valued at name `n` (one value apiece) merge to TWO values at
`n` — a real clash. We CONSTRUCT the clashing pair: `gx` assigns `{0}` to `n`, `gy` assigns `{1}`,
each is single-valued (`card = 1`), but `(merge gx gy).fields n = {0, 1}` has `card = 2`. This is
the `regime.rs::Regime::Field` conflict — the consensus-needing boundary the §2.4 split draws. -/

/-! ## 7. NON-VACUITY teeth — the concrete forks, the dead-wins join, the conflict/resolution edges.

`#guard`s are the project's machine-checked non-vacuity teeth (a false `#guard` is a BUILD ERROR).
`DocGraph` has function fields (no `DecidableEq`), so we guard on its `.order` / `.atoms i` /
`.fields n` PROJECTIONS, which are decidable. The model⟺Rust differential on a concrete trace. -/

#guard conflictGraph.order == ({(pId, aId), (pId, bId)} : Finset (AtomId × AtomId))
-- The CROSS edges are ABSENT (the transitive antichain): 1↛2 and 2↛1 directly.
#guard decide ((aId, bId) ∉ conflictGraph.order)
#guard decide ((bId, aId) ∉ conflictGraph.order)

#guard atomJoin (some Status.dead) (some Status.alive) == some Status.dead
#guard atomJoin (some Status.alive) (some Status.alive) == some Status.alive
-- RESOLUTION adds the cross edge 1→2 (the antichain collapses).
#guard decide ((aId, bId) ∈ resolved.order)
-- THE FIELD CLASH: two single-valued graphs merge to a 2-element value set.
#guard (merge (⟨fun _ => none, ∅, fun _ => {0}⟩ : DocGraph)
              (⟨fun _ => none, ∅, fun _ => {1}⟩ : DocGraph)).fields 0
