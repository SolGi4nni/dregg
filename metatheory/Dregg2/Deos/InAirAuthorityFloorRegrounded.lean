# `Dregg2.Deos.InAirAuthorityFloorRegrounded` — the `FloorDigestBinds` consumers RE-GROUNDED off the
FALSE-AS-NAMED injective felt-digest floor onto a REAL collision game carrying an explicit `Eff`.

## The bug this closes (VACUITY-SWEEP FINDING 2, the `FloorDigestBinds` site)

`InAirAuthorityDigestGadget.FloorDigestBinds hash := ∀ l l' : List ℤ, hash l = hash l' → l = l'` is
stated as **injectivity** of the Option-B felt-domain floor digest — literally the same predicate
shape as `StateCommit.compressNInjective`, which `HashFloorHonesty` ALREADY proves FALSE. `List ℤ` is
INFINITE; the deployed `hash_many` lands in ONE BabyBear felt (`p = 2013265921`), so its range is
FINITE. By pigeonhole the floor is **FALSE at deployed parameters** (§1,
`floorDigestBinds_false_of_finite_range` / `floorDigestBinds_false_babyBear`), and all four consumers
conditioned on it — `gentian_selector_forced_discharged`, `gentian_settle_forced_discharged`,
`gentian_partial_unsat_discharged`, `gentian_phantom_unsat_discharged` — are **VACUOUSLY TRUE** at
real parameters. `#assert_axioms` is blind: the gadget's proofs are clean; the HYPOTHESIS is the flaw.

⚑ **The file states the bound that refutes its own floor.** Every one of those four consumers already
carries `hcanon : ∀ c, 0 ≤ (envAt t i).loc c ∧ (envAt t i).loc c < 2013265921`. The deployed felt range
is right there in the same signature — the premise of `floorDigestBinds_false_babyBear` is a
hypothesis the carrier already assumes about the very felts it digests.

## The re-grounding (the `PreRotationKeySetRegrounded` pattern)

  * **§1 — FALSE AS NAMED.** The counting core (`HashFloorHonesty.not_injective_of_finite_range`)
    fires on `FloorDigestBinds` directly; `floorDigestBinds_false_babyBear` is the deployed form, fed
    by `HashFloorHonesty.finite_range_of_field_bound` — already stated for exactly `List ℤ → ℤ`,
    which is exactly this carrier's type.
  * **§2 — the KEYED family.** `FloorDigestDeployment` bundles the deployed `hash_many` floor digest
    with its domain-separation tag space (the effective key — the standard keyed-from-unkeyed model)
    and the floor the `B_AUTHORITY_DIGEST` limb pre-commits to at each sampled instance.
    `floorDigestFamily` lifts it to a `HashFloorHonesty.KeyedHashFamily`;
    `deployed_hash_is_family_instance` pins FAITHFULNESS — the game is about the function the chip
    computes.
  * **§3 — the ALTERNATE-FLOOR ATTACK GAME.** `gentian_selector_forced_discharged`'s docstring says
    the forger "can dodge NEITHER by an alternate witnessed floor ... NOR by `sel = 0`". The
    alternate-floor dodge is put IN the win relation: handed a sampled tag, the adversary outputs a
    floor and WINS iff it is NOT the committed one yet its digest HITS THE LIMB THE DEPLOYED TRACE
    PUBLISHES at the real `gentianAuthDigestCol` column, read through the real `envAt`. The win
    relation therefore names the deployed gadget, not a restatement of the collision relation —
    and `limb_eq_witnessed_digest_of_sat` PROVES that limb is the very value the gadget's poseidon2
    chip lookup + `gentianRecomputeBindGate` force on a satisfying trace.
  * **§4 — THE REDUCTION.** `alternateFloorToCollisionFinder` pairs the presented floor against the
    committed one; `alternate_wins_imp` proves win-preservation by TRANSPORTING the limb-hit through
    the limb binding `hcommitLimb` into a genuine digest collision; `alternate_adv_le` is the
    advantage inequality by `winProb_le_of_imp`.
  * **§5 — the RE-GROUNDED CONSUMERS.** The Boolean "the alternate-floor dodge is IMPOSSIBLE" becomes
    "impossible EXCEPT with negligible probability" — which is what a real felt hash can actually
    deliver, and what the FALSE injective floor was standing in for.

## ⚑ SCOPE — exactly which leg this re-grounds, and which it does NOT

`gentian_selector_forced_discharged` rests on THREE named hypotheses. This module re-grounds **one**:

  * `hCR : FloorDigestBinds hash` — the **CR leg**, the alternate-floor dodge. RE-GROUNDED here,
    onto `Hard (floorCollisionGame D) Eff` via the reduction.
  * `hChip : ChipTableSound hash (t.tf .poseidon2)` — the **chip-table-faithfulness leg**. NOT
    touched. It is a separate floor (does the poseidon2 chip table actually compute `hash`?) with its
    own shape and its own repair path; nothing here says anything about it.
  * `hcommitLimb : (envAt t i).loc gentianAuthDigestCol = hash committedFloor` — the **wide-commit
    binding**. NOT touched. It is a binding assumption about the rotated limb, discharged (or not)
    upstream by the wide-commit absorption argument, not by any hash floor.

So: the gadget keystone is NOT wholly re-grounded by this file. Its CR leg is. Saying otherwise would
be the exact `Describe-At-CURRENT-Resolution` sin the sweep exists to catch.

## ⚑ RESIDUAL — what the attack game does and does NOT read off the deployed gadget

Stated at CURRENT resolution, not intended:

  * **It DOES** read the attacked value out of a real `VmTrace` — `digestLimb t` is literally
    `(envAt (D.trace t) (D.row t)).loc gentianAuthDigestCol`, the real column through the real `envAt`
    — and `limb_eq_witnessed_digest_of_sat` proves, from `Satisfied2` on the real
    `gentianGadgetDescriptor` plus `ChipTableSound`, that this limb equals the digest of the trace's
    witnessed floor columns, by composing the gadget's OWN deployed levers (`recompute_discharged`
    and the `gentianRecomputeBindGate` gate). So the game's target is the gadget's object.
  * **It does NOT** carry `Satisfied2` inside the win relation. It cannot: `Game.winsDec` demands a
    DECIDABLE win event and `Satisfied2` is not decidable. Satisfaction therefore enters as the
    hypothesis of `limb_eq_witnessed_digest_of_sat`, beside the game, rather than within it.
  * **`hcommitLimb` is a structure FIELD, not a discharged fact.** The deployment ASSERTS that the
    published limb is the committed floor's digest. That is the gadget keystone's own third
    hypothesis, held fixed, and the reduction transports through it — it is not proved here, and this
    file makes no claim to prove it.
  * **The trace is a deployment field, not a live prover output.** `D.trace` is quantified over, so
    the bound holds for every trace family the deployment names; no `VmTrace` produced by the Rust
    prover is exhibited anywhere in this file.

## ⚑ THE `Eff` PARAMETER IS THE WHOLE HONESTY, AND IT IS UNDISCHARGED

`FloorGames` §2 (`hard_top_iff_solvableFrac_negl`): at the UNRESTRICTED adversary class a game floor IS
the existence floor, so it is FALSE wherever collisions exist — and §1 proves they exist at the
deployed felt digest. §7 instantiates both poles at THIS carrier:
`floorDigest_floor_top_false_of_compressing` / `_babyBear` (`Eff := ⊤` is FALSE at deployed
parameters) and `floorDigest_floor_bot_vacuous` (`Eff := ⊥` is vacuous). So `Eff` is a PARAMETER, in
the open, at every use site: this tree has no cost model (`FloorGames` §8), and inventing a shallow
imitation would be another costume. `hEff` is UNDISCHARGED; naming it is the repair.

## Non-fake

The floor is REFUTABLE (`brokenFloorDigest_floor_top_false`: a constant felt digest has a finder
winning at every tag, advantage `1`) and the reduction is LOAD-BEARING (§6's canary: the keystone does
NOT follow from the floor applied at some OTHER finder). The OLD `FloorDigestBinds` consumers are KEPT
untouched in `InAirAuthorityDigestGadget`; siblings ADDED here. `#assert_all_clean`; no `sorry`, no
fresh `axiom`.

## Coordination

This is the felt-domain Option-B floor-digest lane. The key-set carrier is
`Apps.PreRotationKeySetRegrounded`; `RosterCR` is `Circuit.CouncilRosterRegrounded`; the
STARK/FRI/Merkle hash consumers are `Circuit.FloorRegroundedConsumers` / `Circuit.Poseidon2KeyedBridge`.

/-! ## §1 — FALSE AS NAMED: the injective `FloorDigestBinds` floor is refuted by the deployed digest.

`FloorDigestBinds hash` IS `Function.Injective hash` on the INFINITE `List ℤ` — the identical
predicate `HashFloorHonesty` already refutes for `Poseidon2SpongeCR` and `compressNInjective`. The
deployed Option-B floor digest is `hash_many` into ONE BabyBear felt, so its range is finite and the
counting core fires. No felt collision need be exhibited; cardinality suffices, and is the honest
statement. -/

/-- **TOOTH — `FloorDigestBinds` is FALSE for any range-bounded felt digest.** Literally the counting
core: the floor IS injectivity on `List ℤ`, which is infinite, while a real digest's range is finite.
Stated in the same shape as its flagged siblings
(`HashFloorHonesty.poseidon2SpongeCR_false_of_finite_range`,
`HashFloorHonesty.compressNInjective_false_of_finite_range`) — this carrier is the third instance of
the same predicate, and it is false for the same reason. -/
theorem floorDigestBinds_false_of_finite_range (hash : List ℤ → ℤ)
    (hfin : (Set.range hash).Finite) : ¬ FloorDigestBinds hash :=
  fun hCR => not_injective_of_finite_range hash hfin (fun l l' h => hCR l l' h)

/-- **TOOTH (deployed form) — `FloorDigestBinds` is FALSE at the deployed BabyBear felt digest.** A
digest whose output is a genuine BabyBear field element (`0 ≤ · < p`, `p = 2³¹ − 2²⁷ + 1`) — i.e. every
real `hash_many` Option-B floor commitment, the object the gadget's own docstring points at ("the
felt-domain digest of the cell's required-tag floor") — REFUTES the floor.

⚑ The refuting bound is ALREADY IN THE CONSUMERS' SIGNATURES: `gentian_selector_forced_discharged`
carries `hcanon : ∀ c, 0 ≤ (envAt t i).loc c ∧ (envAt t i).loc c < 2013265921`. The file states the
felt range that refutes its own floor. So the floor is not merely un-proven at the deployed hash; it is
provably FALSE there, and every `FloorDigestBinds` consumer is vacuous at real parameters. -/

  floorDigestBinds_false_of_finite_range hash (finite_range_of_field_bound hash _ hb)

/-- **THE COLLISION THE FALSITY EXHIBITS.** A range-bounded felt digest has, at every parameter, a
genuine collision — two DISTINCT floors with equal digests. This is the counting core in the positive
form the game floors below consume: it is what makes the `⊤`-class floor false (§7), and therefore what
makes the `Eff` parameter load-bearing rather than decorative. -/

/-! ## §2 — the KEYED family: domain separation is the key.

The deployed `hash_many` is a FIXED unkeyed function; its effective key is the domain-separation tag
the chip absorbs ahead of the floor felts. Modelling that tag as the key is the standard
keyed-from-unkeyed treatment (`Poseidon2KeyedBridge` §1-§2) and is what stops the "hardcode a known
collision" degeneracy that collapses an unkeyed floor. -/

/-- **The deployed Option-B floor-digest scheme.** `hash` is the tag-keyed felt-domain floor digest
(the deployed `hash_many` at each domain-separation tag); `Tag` is the finite, inhabited tag space the
CR game samples; `committedFloor t` is the required-tag floor the `B_AUTHORITY_DIGEST` limb commits to
at the sampled instance `t` — the `committedFloor` argument of `gentian_selector_forced_discharged`;
`deployedTag` is the tag the cell computes.

⚑ The instance also carries the DEPLOYED TRACE (`trace t`) and the attacked row (`row t`), so that the
attack game below can be stated about the value the trace actually PUBLISHES at the real
`gentianAuthDigestCol` column — read out through the real `envAt` — rather than about a restatement of
the collision relation. `hcommitLimb` is the gadget keystone's own `hcommitLimb` hypothesis, carried as
a NAMED FIELD: it is the leg this file explicitly does NOT re-ground (see the header), and naming it
here keeps it visible rather than dissolving it. -/

/-- **The published authority-digest limb** at the sampled instance: the value the deployed trace
carries at the real `gentianAuthDigestCol` column, read through the real `envAt`. This — not a
restatement of `hash (committedFloor t)` — is what the attack game below makes the adversary hit. -/

/-- **`floorDigestFamily D`** — the deployed felt-domain floor digest lifted to a `KeyedHashFamily`,
keyed by its domain-separation tag, with `Input := List ℤ` and `Out := ℤ` — exactly the carrier's own
types. This is the object `HashFloorHonesty.CollisionResistant` is realized at for the real digest. -/

  keyNonempty := fun _ => D.tagNonempty
  inputDecEq := inferInstance
  outDecEq := inferInstance

/-- **FAITHFULNESS.** The deployed FIXED digest IS the keyed family's instance at the deployed tag — a
definitional equality, no idealization. So the collision game below is a game about the very function
the gadget's poseidon2 chip lookup computes. -/

/-- **THE OLD-FLOOR ⟹ NEW-FLOOR BRIDGE.** If the injective `FloorDigestBinds` held at every tag it
would discharge `CollisionResistant (floorDigestFamily D)` (no collisions ⟹ every finder's advantage
`0`). So the OLD floor was STRICTLY STRONGER than the honest computational floor — and, being FALSE at
the deployed digest (§1), it was an EMPTY hypothesis. Nothing is lost re-grounding; a false hypothesis
is replaced by one a real felt hash can satisfy. -/

/-! ## §3 — the floor COLLISION GAME and the ALTERNATE-FLOOR ATTACK GAME, as first-class objects. -/

/-- **THE FLOOR-DIGEST COLLISION GAME.** Instances are sampled domain-separation tags; the adversary
outputs two floors and WINS iff they are a GENUINE collision of the deployed felt digest at that tag —
distinct floors, equal digests. This is the game the floor below quantifies over, with an explicit
adversary class. -/

  wins := fun _ t p => p.1 ≠ p.2 ∧ D.hash t p.1 = D.hash t p.2
  winsDec := fun _ _ _ => inferInstance

/-- **THE PROBLEM IS IN THE STATEMENT** — the win relation unfolds, by `Iff.rfl`, to a genuine
collision of the real deployed felt digest. Not a docstring: the `Prop` itself. -/
theorem floorCollisionGame_wins_iff (D : FloorDigestDeployment) (n : ℕ) (t : D.Tag)
    (p : List ℤ × List ℤ) :
    (floorCollisionGame D).wins n t p ↔ (p.1 ≠ p.2 ∧ D.hash t p.1 = D.hash t p.2) :=
  Iff.rfl

/-- **THE ALTERNATE-FLOOR ATTACK GAME.** `gentian_selector_forced_discharged`'s docstring says the
forger "can dodge NEITHER by an alternate witnessed floor (the recompute lookup + recompute-bind + CR
floor force it equal to the committed floor) NOR by `sel = 0`". This game IS the first dodge, as a win
relation: handed a sampled tag, the adversary outputs a floor and WINS iff it is NOT the committed
floor yet its digest HITS THE LIMB THE DEPLOYED TRACE PUBLISHES at `gentianAuthDigestCol`. Such a floor
rides the recompute chain: the chip lookup digests it, the recompute-bind gate ties that digest to the
published limb, and the decode then reads an escrow requirement out of the WRONG floor — so the
selector is no longer forced.

⚑ Note what the win relation mentions: `D.digestLimb t`, i.e. `(envAt (D.trace t) (D.row t)).loc
gentianAuthDigestCol` — the real column of the real gadget, read through the real `envAt`. It is NOT
`D.hash t (D.committedFloor t)` restated; that the two coincide is `hcommitLimb`, a hypothesis the
reduction must TRANSPORT THROUGH (`alternate_wins_imp`), and `limb_eq_witnessed_digest_of_sat` proves
this limb is the same object the deployed gadget's chip lookup forces. -/

/-- **⚑ FAITHFULNESS — the attacked limb is the object the DEPLOYED GADGET forces.** On a satisfying
gadget trace, against the sound chip table, the published `gentianAuthDigestCol` limb IS the felt
digest of the trace's WITNESSED floor columns — proven by composing the gadget's own deployed levers:
`recompute_discharged` (the poseidon2 chip lookup forces `witDigestCol = hash [F0, F1]`) with the
`gentianRecomputeBindGate` gate (which ties `witDigestCol` to `gentianAuthDigestCol`, field-faithfully
under `hcanon`).

This is what stops `digestLimb` from being an abstracted stand-in: the value the attack game makes the
adversary hit is exactly the value the deployed recompute chain publishes. Hitting it with a floor
`≠ committedFloor` is precisely the step at which `gentian_selector_forced_discharged` invokes `hCR`. -/

/-- **THE REDUCTION, AS A MAP OF ADVERSARIES.** An alternate-floor forger becomes a floor-digest
collision finder by pairing the floor it PRESENTED against the floor the limb COMMITTED to. This is not
a rename and not a re-indexing: it is the gadget's `hdig` step (`hash witnessedFloor = hash
committedFloor`, forced by the recompute lookup + recompute-bind gate) read as an extractor — the

level.** Wherever the alternate-floor forger wins, the extracted pair is a GENUINE collision of the
deployed felt digest. The win hands over `hash presented = digestLimb t` — an equation about the value
the TRACE PUBLISHES, not about `hash committed`; the reduction must TRANSPORT it through the limb
binding `hcommitLimb` (the gadget keystone's own named hypothesis) to land `hash presented = hash
committed`, which with `presented ≠ committed` is the collision. That transport is the deployed step
`gentian_selector_forced_discharged` performs before invoking `hCR`. The crypto content lives in a
proof term, not in a sentence about one. -/

/-! ## §5 — the RE-GROUNDED CONSUMERS.

The Boolean keystones become advantage bounds, derived FROM the collision floor VIA the reduction. The
old statements are kept in `InAirAuthorityDigestGadget`; these are their honest siblings. -/

/-- **⚑ RE-GROUNDED `InAirAuthorityDigestGadget.gentian_selector_forced_discharged` (CR LEG).**

Under the floor-digest collision floor at the game the reduction actually attacks, an alternate-floor
forger whose extracted finder is in the floor's adversary class has NEGLIGIBLE advantage: the Boolean
"the alternate-witnessed-floor dodge is IMPOSSIBLE" becomes "impossible EXCEPT with negligible
probability" — which is what a real felt hash can actually deliver, and what the FALSE injective
`FloorDigestBinds` was standing in for.

⚑ **SCOPE.** This re-grounds the CR leg — the `hCR` step of the keystone, where an alternate witnessed
floor is ruled out. The keystone's OTHER two hypotheses are untouched and remain exactly as they were:
`hChip : ChipTableSound hash (t.tf .poseidon2)` (chip-table faithfulness — a separate floor with its
own repair path) and `hcommitLimb` (the wide-commit binding of `gentianAuthDigestCol`). The gadget
keystone as a whole is NOT re-grounded by this file; one of its three legs is.

Unlike its predecessor this statement is FALSE if you delete the reduction: the conclusion is about the
alternate-floor game, the hypothesis about the collision game, and `alternate_adv_le` is the only
bridge (§6's canary compiles that fact).

⚑ **`hEff` IS UNDISCHARGED AND THAT IS THE HONEST STATE** — the standard "the reduction is efficient"
side condition, a PARAMETER because this tree has no cost model (`FloorGames` §8). The floor's honesty
is exactly its `Eff`'s, and §7 prices both poles: `⊤` makes it FALSE at the deployed felt digest, `⊥`
vacuous. -/

/-- **⚑ RE-GROUNDED `gentian_settle_forced_discharged` / `gentian_partial_unsat_discharged` /
`gentian_phantom_unsat_discharged` (CR LEG).** All three downstream consumers take `hCR` and use it
ONLY through `gentian_selector_forced_discharged` — they add no further crypto step (the settle-forcing
is gate arithmetic off the forced selector; the two unsat teeth are `decide` contradictions off the
settle-forcing). So the CR leg of all three is re-grounded by the SAME bound: the alternate-floor dodge
that would break the selector forcing has negligible advantage.

The `Eff` obligation is the same undischarged side condition as above — named, not hidden. Their
`hChip` and `hcommitLimb` legs are likewise untouched. -/

/-! ## §6 — the CANARY: break the reduction and the keystone goes RED. -/

/-- **(CANARY — the keystone does NOT follow from the floor applied at some OTHER finder.)** Strip the
reduction — try to conclude the alternate-floor forger's negligibility from the collision floor applied
at some OTHER finder `B`, NOT the one extracted from the forger — and the proof does not go through:
the floor bounds `B`, and only `alternate_adv_le` connects the EXTRACTED finder to the alternate-floor
game. Under the OLD free hypothesis (`hCR : FloorDigestBinds hash`, hypothesis and conclusion sharing
the same free `hash`) this tooth was unwritable. It compiles now, and reds if a future edit reconnects
the games. -/

    (hcol : Hard (floorCollisionGame D) Eff) : True := by
  fail_if_success
    (have : Negl (gameAdv (alternateFloorGame D) A) := hcol B hB)
  trivial

/-- **THE POSITIVE POLE — the RIGHT floor DOES discharge it.** A gate that refuses everything is a
broken keystone, not a fixed one. With the collision floor at the EXTRACTED finder the keystone fires.
Refusal is discrimination only if acceptance still happens. -/

/-! ## §7 — the `Eff` parameter, PRICED: both poles proved at THIS carrier.

`FloorGames` §2 says a game floor at the unrestricted class IS the existence floor. Here is that
theorem instantiated at the deployed felt-domain floor digest, so a reader can price any `Eff` exactly
rather than take the residual on faith. -/

/-- **⚑ (TOOTH — the floor is FALSE at `Eff := ⊤` for the DEPLOYED digest.)** The real content, and the
reason `Eff` is not decoration: a range-bounded felt digest HAS a collision at every tag (§1's counting
core), so the collision game is always solvable, so the floor at the unrestricted adversary class is
FALSE — and every consumer would be vacuous there. `Classical.choice` is the adversary and no
restatement of the win relation can see it coming. This is the price of `hEff`, stated as a theorem
instead of a promise. -/
theorem floorDigest_floor_top_false_of_compressing (D : FloorDigestDeployment)
    (hfin : ∀ t : D.Tag, (Set.range (D.hash t)).Finite) :
    ¬ Hard (floorCollisionGame D) (fun _ => True) :=
  not_hard_top_of_always_solvable (floorCollisionGame D)
    (fun _ => ⟨([], [])⟩)
    (fun _ t => exists_collision_of_finite_range (D.hash t) (hfin t))

/-- **(TOOTH — the deployed BabyBear form of the same.)** A genuine BabyBear felt digest (`0 ≤ · < p`)
refutes the unrestricted-class floor — the deployment the gadget's docstring names is exactly where
`Eff := ⊤` fails.

⚑ Note what supplies the hypothesis: the consumers' OWN `hcanon : ∀ c, 0 ≤ (envAt t i).loc c ∧
(envAt t i).loc c < 2013265921` asserts precisely this felt bound about the columns the digest ranges
over. The signature that carries the floor also carries its refutation. -/

  floorDigest_floor_top_false_of_compressing D
    (fun t => finite_range_of_field_bound (D.hash t) _ (fun l => hb t l))

/-- **(TOOTH — the OTHER pole: `Eff := ⊥` is vacuous.)** At the empty adversary class the floor holds
for ANY deployment, including a completely broken felt digest. Recorded HONESTLY: a satisfiability
witness is worth nothing without the refutation beside it, and these two poles together are what make
`Eff` a dial rather than a costume. -/

/-! ### The floor is REFUTABLE on a broken deployment (load-bearing, not `True`-shaped). -/

distinct floors collides at every tag, and every floor whatsoever hits the published limb. -/

  trace := fun _ => { rows := [], pub := zeroAsg, tf := fun _ => [] }
  row := fun _ => 0
  hcommitLimb := fun _ => rfl

/-- **(TOOTH — the floor is REFUTABLE.)** The broken deployment's collision game is solvable at every
tag (`[0] ≠ [1]`, both digest to `0`), so it has no unrestricted-class floor. So the floor is a GENUINE
constraint — a broken digest refutes it — not vacuously true. -/

  not_hard_top_of_always_solvable (floorCollisionGame brokenFloorDigest)

    (fun _ _ => ⟨([0], [1]), by decide, rfl⟩)

/-- **(TOOTH — the ATTACK game is refutable too.)** On the broken deployment the alternate-floor dodge
SUCCEEDS at every tag (`[0] ≠ []` yet both digest to `0`), so the attack game has no unrestricted-class
floor either. The dodge the keystone's CR leg rules out is a real event that a real (broken) digest
admits — the win relation is not `True`-shaped in the other direction. -/

    (fun _ _ => ⟨[0], List.cons_ne_nil _ _, rfl⟩)

/-! ### The floor is SATISFIABLE (the connection to the keyed-family treatment). -/

/-- **(TOOTH — the keyed family is SATISFIABLE on an injective deployment.)** A deployment whose per-tag
digest is injective discharges `CollisionResistant (floorDigestFamily D)` — the honest floor is
REALIZABLE, unlike the injective `FloorDigestBinds` at deployed parameters. ⚑ Recorded with its price:
this is the `⊤`-class object, which §7's first tooth proves FALSE at a range-bounded (i.e. real) felt
digest. The satisfiability is honest only as a non-emptiness check, never as evidence the deployed
`hash_many` satisfies it. -/
