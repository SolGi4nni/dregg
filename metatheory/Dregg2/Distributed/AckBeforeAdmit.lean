# Dregg2.Distributed.AckBeforeAdmit — the acknowledge-before-admit buffer rule
# (Blocklace paper §5.1–§5.3), authored HERE and exported to the node's ingest path.

**THIS IS LEAN-AUTHORED CONSENSUS LOGIC. Rust calls the exported artifact and decides nothing.**

## The defect this closes

`docs/reference/READING-BLOCKLACE-2026-08-08.md` §0.4 (`e549b1117`): the blocklace's headline
guarantee — *"a Byzantine node may harm only a finite prefix of the computation"* — is
**Proposition 5.5 (Finite Harm)** of the blocklace's own paper (Almeida & Shapiro,
arXiv:2402.08068, `pdfs/blocklace-byzantine-repelling-crdt-almeida-shapiro-2402.08068.pdf`),
and its entire content is the §5.3 **acknowledge-before-admit buffer discipline**. Our buffer
(`node/src/catchup.rs::OrphanBuffer`) buffered on **missing predecessors only**. Without the
acknowledgment condition there is no `R_q(B)` and no bound: BC §5.1 — *"a colluder `p` can remain
undetected indefinitely, allowing it to create any number of blocks, preceded by any number of
blocks from the Byzantine node `q`, indefinitely, and thus polluting the blocklace of any node
accepting `p`-blocks."* The paper proves the colluder can **never** be exposed in finite time
(Def. 5.2: exposure "only at infinity"), so the buffer is not an optimisation over detection —
it is the only thing bounding the damage.

## The rule (BC §5.3, with one deviation, named below)

A received block is staged until its predecessors are present (the existing orphan buffer —
CM Def. 19 *closed*, **unchanged and not relaxed**: it is the hypothesis under DAG-Rider's
same-causal-history property and this repo's `ClosedExtension` discharges). Once closed, a
candidate **head** `h` licenses the batch `S = ⌊h⌋ ∩ D` (its own closure intersected with the
buffer), admitted at once into `B' = B ∪ S`, iff either

1. **first evidence** (BC Def. 5.3 clause 1, §5.1 principle 2): admitting `h` strictly grows
   `byz` — `h` completes a fork (or otherwise first-proves a creator Byzantine). First evidence
   is always admissible; anything else would break eventual visibility of the proof itself.
2. **acknowledged head** (BC Def. 5.3 clause 2 + the `R_q` condition of Prop. 5.5's proof):
   `node(h) ∉ byz(B ∪ S)`, and for EVERY `q ∈ byz(B)` the head's own closure carries the
   evidence (`q ∈ byz(⌊h⌋)` — an incomparable `q`-pair inside `⌊h⌋`), and — the `R_q` tooth —
   if the batch carries any `q`-block then this is the head creator's FIRST acknowledging block
   (`r ∈ R_q(B)`: no prior `r`-block in `B` acknowledges `q`).

## The deviation from Def. 5.3's letter, and why it is the paper's own intent

BC Def. 5.3 read strictly requires a full peeling of `B'` down to `∅` in which EVERY block
satisfies clause 1 or 2 against its growing prefix. That reading refuses every pre-knowledge
block forever: an `r`-block created before `r` saw the evidence has `byz(B) ⊄ byz(⌊b'⌋)` at
every position of every peel (the evidence is already in `B`, hence in every prefix), so it can
never enter — contradicting the paper's own §5.3 narrative (*"except perhaps for some `r`-block
`b'` that precedes some block `b` … with `b'` created before `s` knew `q` to be Byzantine"*),
the proof of Prop. 5.4 (old honest blocks must eventually enter), and §5.1 principle 1.
What Prop. 5.5's proof actually counts is **head-licensed batches**: *"`p` will add a new
`q`-block `b` to `B` only if `b` precedes an `r`-block `b'` for some `r` ∈ R_q(B) such that
`q ∈ byz(b')`"* — the license lives at the head, interior blocks ride in its closure, and the
head's creator must be in `R_q(B)` (no prior acknowledgment). This module implements THAT gate:
clauses checked at the head, batch confined to the head's signed closure, plus the explicit
`R_q`-freshness condition. Without the freshness tooth, bare clause 2 admits an unbounded
laundering replay: a never-equivocating Byzantine `r` that acknowledges the fork in every block
while pointing at fresh `q`-blocks would ferry them in forever. With it, each `(r, q)` pair
licenses q-carriage ONCE — `admit_shrinks_Rq` below — which is exactly the decreasing measure
of the paper's proof.

## What `byz` is here, honestly (the narrowing)

BC §5.2 extends `byz` to `eqvc(B) ∪ {creators of ¬wf / ¬valid / ¬brep blocks}`. This module's
`byzOf` is **`eqvc` only** — equivocators by TRUE incomparability (Def. 4.2, the same shape as
`Authority.Blocklace.Equivocation` / `finality.rs::detect_equivocation`; deliberately NOT the
round-equality subset `hasEquivInPast` tests). Consequences, stated rather than hidden:

* **The harm bound below binds equivocators** (and their colluders). A Byzantine node whose
  misbehavior never includes an equivocation is invisible to this `byz` and is NOT bounded by
  this gate. Forged signatures / unenrolled creators are refused outright by the Rust pin
  (`receive_block_pinned` — BC §4.1 option 1, correct for unverifiable authorship: an unsigned
  block proves nothing about its claimed creator). Non-cordial blocks (CM Def. 25) are the
  named unwired debt of `BlocklaceFinality.isCordialBlock`; the right composition when it is
  wired is BC §4.1 **option 2** — a `¬wf` arm INSIDE `byzOf` (admit the block as evidence,
  flag its creator) — never a discard, which would violate eventual visibility of the evidence,
  and never a hold. The `¬brep(≺b)` recursive arm is likewise future work; with the `R_q`
  freshness tooth above it is not needed for the equivocator bound.

## The harm bound this buys (stated against Prop. 5.5)

Once `B` holds evidence for `q` (`q ∈ byzOf B`), a new `q`-block enters only inside a batch
whose head is first evidence (each such head strictly grows `byzOf` — at most once per creator,
`first_evidence_grows`) or an acknowledging head whose creator is FRESH for `q`
(`admit_shrinks_Rq`: the admission removes that creator from `R_q` — at most once per roster
member). Each batch is `⌊head⌋ ∩ D`, bounded by the Rust buffer cap (`MAX_ORPHANS`). So the
`q`-blocks admitted after evidence number at most
`(|R_q(B)| + |roster \ byz|) × MAX_ORPHANS` — **finite, and q-admission STOPS once `R_q`
drains to colluders**, who by Def. 5.2 never produce an acknowledging head. This is Prop. 5.5's
"finite prefix" — finite but a-priori-unbounded in the paper, here additionally per-batch-capped
— under the paper's own hypotheses (Node Liveness Def. 5.1, connected correct nodes) and the
`byz = eqvc` narrowing above. The count is assembled from the per-step theorems below; the
induction over ingest RUNS (a trace semantics for the buffer loop) is prose, not yet a theorem —
the same class of named boundary as `sortedLace`'s qsort-permutation note in
`BlocklaceFinality`.

## Composition with the other admission-adjacent rules (three rules, one order, no fight)

1. **Closure** (orphan buffer / `MissingPredecessor`) — untouched, evaluated FIRST, and
   re-checked here (`batchClosed`): admission never relaxes it.
2. **Signature/roster pin** (`receive_block_pinned`) — Rust, §8 crypto seam; runs per block ON
   admission, after this gate says yes. A pin refusal drops the block; its dependents re-orphan.
   The gate's `byz(B)` premise therefore only ever reads VERIFIED blocks; batch-interior
   (not-yet-pinned) blocks can never spoof evidence into another head's closure because `S` is
   confined to the head's own signed pointer closure.
3. **THIS GATE** (BC §5.3) — decides WHETHER/WHEN a closed, pinnable block enters the lace.
4. **Exclusion-by-past** (`ExclusionByPast` / τ's anchor-relative `hasEquivInPast`) — decides
   what already-admitted structure COUNTS at ordering time; per-closure, never buffers, never
   refuses ingest. This gate bounds how much excluded material can pile up; exclusion-by-past
   discounts whatever still enters. They compose freely because they act at different times on
   different questions.
5. **Cordiality** (`isCordialBlock`) — defined, still unwired (its own module says so); the
   prescribed composition is the `¬wf` arm of `byzOf` above, NOT a fourth buffer.

`#assert_axioms`-clean (⊆ {propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}) for the spec theorems;
concrete-trace instances are `native_decide` + `#assert_compiled` (they execute the fuel-bounded
BFS `causalPastIncl`, which does not kernel-reduce under `decide` — the boundary
`BlocklaceFinality` §9 records). Verified with `lake build Dregg2.Distributed.AckBeforeAdmit`.

/-! ## 1. `eqvc` by TRUE incomparability, executably (BC Def. 4.2).

NOT the round-equality subset (`hasEquivInPast`): two same-creator blocks are an equivocation
iff neither observes the other, whatever their rounds. `causalPastIncl B x` is `x`'s INCLUSIVE
causal past, so for distinct ids `a ≺ b ↔ a ∈ ⌊b⌋`. -/

/-- `a ∥ b` — distinct ids, neither in the other's inclusive causal past (BC Def. 4.2's `∥`). -/
def incomparableB (B : Lace) (a b : Block) : Bool :=
  a.id != b.id
    && !(causalPastIncl B b.id).contains a.id
    && !(causalPastIncl B a.id).contains b.id

/-- `q ∈ eqvc(B)`: some incomparable same-creator pair by `q` exists in `B` (the pair need not
be observed by anyone — BC §4.2's remark; `finality.rs::detect_equivocation`). -/
def equivocatesIn (B : Lace) (q : AuthorId) : Bool :=
  B.any fun a => a.creator == q && B.any fun b => b.creator == q && incomparableB B a b

/-- **`byzOf B`** — `byz(B)` under the `eqvc`-only narrowing (module docblock): the distinct
creators of `B` that equivocate in `B`. -/
def byzOf (B : Lace) : List AuthorId :=
  ((B.map (·.creator)).dedup).filter (equivocatesIn B)

/-- **`acksByz B b q`** — `q ∈ byz(⌊b⌋)`: an incomparable `q`-pair inside `b`'s OWN closure.
This is the block-level acknowledgment BC §5.3 waits for, and the executable twin of
`ExclusionByPast.ByzInClosure` (which proves the agreement/durability/partial-view poles of
exactly this per-closure shape at the `Prop` level). `acksByz B b b.creator` is the executable
`ExcludedByPast`. -/
def acksByz (B : Lace) (b : Block) (q : AuthorId) : Bool :=
  equivocatesIn (closureLace B b.id) q

/-- `r` already has an acknowledging block for `q` in `B` — the negation of `r ∈ R_q(B)`'s
second condition (Prop. 5.5's proof). -/
def hadAcked (B : Lace) (r q : AuthorId) : Bool :=
  B.any fun b => b.creator == r && acksByz B b q

/-- The batch carries a `q`-block. -/
def carriesBlockBy (S : Lace) (q : AuthorId) : Bool :=
  S.any fun s => s.creator == q

/-- **`Rq B roster q`** — the paper's `R_q(B)` (proof of Prop. 5.5): roster members not
themselves flagged and with no acknowledging block for `q` in `B`. The decreasing measure of
the finite-harm argument. -/
def Rq (B : Lace) (roster : List AuthorId) (q : AuthorId) : List AuthorId :=

/-! ## 2. The batch and the gate (BC §5.3: `S = ⌊b⌋ ∩ D`, admitted at once). -/

/-- `U` with the head removed — the `B \ {b}` of Def. 5.3 clause 1. -/
def sans (U : Lace) (h : BlockId) : Lace := U.filter (fun b => b.id != h)

/-- **`batchOf B D h`** — `S = ⌊h⌋ ∩ D`: the buffered blocks inside the head's own closure,
computed over `B ∪ D`. Confinement to the head's SIGNED closure is load-bearing: nothing an
adversary places in `D` can enter (or influence the head-clean check through) a batch whose
head does not point at it. -/
def batchOf (B D : Lace) (h : BlockId) : Lace :=
  let past := causalPastIncl (B ++ D) h
  D.filter fun d => past.contains d.id

/-- **`batchClosed B S`** — every predecessor of every batch member resolves in `B ∪ S`
(BC §5.3's `⌊S⌋ ⊆ B ∪ S`; CM Def. 19 *closed*). The closure gate, RE-CHECKED at admission —
never relaxed. -/
def batchClosed (B S : Lace) : Bool :=
  S.all fun s => s.preds.all fun p => (B ++ S).has p

/-- **Clause 1 — first evidence** (Def. 5.3.1, principle 2): removing the head shrinks `byz`,
i.e. the head is essential to some creator's flagging. -/
def firstEvidence (B S : Lace) (h : BlockId) : Bool :=
  (byzOf (B ++ S)).any fun q => !(byzOf (sans (B ++ S) h)).contains q

/-- **Clause 2 — acknowledged head** (Def. 5.3.2 + the `R_q` condition): head's creator is not
Byzantine in `B ∪ S`; the head's own closure acknowledges EVERY currently-known Byzantine; and
for each `q` the batch carries blocks of, this is the creator's FIRST acknowledgment
(`replay_refused` is the tooth this last conjunct grows). -/
def headLicensed (B S : Lace) (hb : Block) : Bool :=
  !(byzOf (B ++ S)).contains hb.creator
    && (byzOf B).all fun q =>
         acksByz (B ++ S) hb q
           && (!carriesBlockBy S q || !hadAcked B hb.creator q)

/-- **THE GATE** — BC §5.3's admission procedure for head candidate `h` against lace `B` and
buffer `D`: the head must be a buffered block, the batch closed, and clause 1 or clause 2 hold.
The Rust ingest (`node/src/catchup.rs::apply_with_buffering`) consults this (via the export
below) before ANY insert once a fork is known, and holds the block otherwise. -/
def admitBatch (B D : Lace) (h : BlockId) : Bool :=
  match (batchOf B D h).lookup h with
  | none => false
  | some hb =>
      batchClosed B (batchOf B D h)
        && (firstEvidence B (batchOf B D h) h || headLicensed B (batchOf B D h) hb)

/-- The admitted batch in an insertion order compatible with `≺` (closure sizes ascending:
`a ≺ b ⇒ ⌊a⌋ ⊊ ⌊b⌋ ⇒ |⌊a⌋| < |⌊b⌋|`). The Rust side re-verifies each emitted block through
`receive_block_pinned`, which enforces closure per insert — a mis-ordered emission cannot
corrupt the lace, only re-orphan. -/
def batchOrder (B D : Lace) (h : BlockId) : List BlockId :=
  let S := batchOf B D h
  let U := B ++ S
  ((S.map fun s => (s.id, (causalPastIncl U s.id).length)).mergeSort
      (fun a b => a.2 ≤ b.2)).map (·.1)

/-! ## 3. Spec theorems — the gate's promises, named. -/

/-- The gate's whole truth condition, given the head resolves in its batch. Everything below is
a corollary, named separately because each is a distinct promise the ingest relies on. -/

/-- **The colluder pole** — a head that does not acknowledge a known Byzantine is never
licensed. A colluder (Def. 5.2: NO block ever acknowledges `q`) therefore never licenses a
batch; its stream is held forever, and with it every `q`-block it ferries. -/

the head's creator from `R_q` of the POST-admission lace — the head itself is now the
acknowledging block. Each `(creator, q)` pair can therefore drain from `R_q` at most once, and
`R_q` never refills (acknowledgments are blocks; blocks are never removed). -/
