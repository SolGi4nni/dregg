# Dregg2.Distributed.FinalityGate — the LIVE finality GATE: an `@[export]`ed wire surface that
# computes the VERIFIED finalized order (`BlocklaceFinality.tauOrder`) and a soundness predicate the
# node uses to GATE the live commit on the verified rule.

**The gap this closes.** `Dregg2/Distributed/BlocklaceFinality.lean` faithfully models the node's
`ordering.rs::tau` and proves the safety properties the path relies on. But that proof lived
*beside* the running node: `node/src/blocklace_sync.rs::poll_finalized_blocks` ran the Rust `tau`
and sliced its output to the executor with the Lean model only AGREEMENT-CHECKED in a unit test
(`ordering::tests::test_tau_differential_against_lean_model`). The verified rule did NOT gate the
live commit.

This module is the **gate surface**. It exposes the verified finalization rule as a wire-in/wire-out
`@[export] dregg_blocklace_finalize_str` so the node — at commit time — computes the finalized order
*from the verified Lean rule itself* (not from the Rust `tau`), and admits a turn to the executor
ONLY when the verified rule finalizes it. "Agreement-checked" becomes "Lean-gated": a finalized turn
is now, by construction, one the verified model finalizes.

## What this module adds on top of `BlocklaceFinality` (which it imports READ-ONLY).

1. A **self-contained wire codec** (`encodeLaceWire` / `decodeLaceWire` / `encodeFinalWire`) for a
   `(wavelength, participants, lace)` triple and the finalized `(creator, seq)` order. Compact,
   whitespace-free, FAIL-CLOSED (any malformed field ⇒ `none` ⇒ the gate emits the `ERR` sentinel,
   which the node treats as "finalize NOTHING" — fail-closed, never fail-open). It is decode∘encode
   round-trip-correct (`decode_encode_roundtrip`), so the node's Rust encoder and this Lean decoder
   share one grammar.

2. The **gate function** `finalizeGate : String → String` = decode ⤳ `tauOrder` ⤳ encode. This is
   the body of the `@[export]`.

3. The **gate soundness predicate + theorem** the node relies on:
   `gateAdmits B P w (c, s)` — "the verified rule finalizes the block `(creator=c, seq=s)`" — and
   `gate_admits_iff_verified_finalizes`: the gate ADMITS a `(creator, seq)` iff that pair is in the
   verified `tauGolden` order. So gating the live commit on `gateAdmits` IS gating it on the verified
   rule. Plus the concrete n=3 safety instances: an equivocating leader's lace anchors NOTHING
   (`the_equivocating_lace_anchors_nothing`) and a present-but-unanchored block is refused
   (`gate_refuses_a_present_unanchored_block`) — the live-path safety teeth, proved over the gate.

4. **n>1 non-vacuity** (named `native_decide` theorems + `#assert_compiled`, per
   `metatheory/docs/GUARD-DISCIPLINE.md`): on the concrete 3-node laces the gate anchors exactly
   what the verified ANCHOR-CHAIN rule (CM Alg. 2, `BlocklaceFinality` §5b) finalizes — one wave
   delivers its leader's closure (`F=1:0`), two waves deliver the first wave's whole cohort plus
   the second anchor (ten blocks) — and on the equivocating-leader lace it admits NOTHING: the
   gate reproduces the verified rule at n=3.

## SCOPE.

* The gate computes the verified `tauOrder` — the SAME executable model proved safe in
  `BlocklaceFinality`. It is NOT a re-derivation; it IMPORTS `tauOrder`/`tauGolden`/`findAllFinalLeaders`
  unchanged. The novelty is the EXPORTED WIRE SURFACE + the ADMISSION predicate + its soundness, so the
  running node can consult the verified rule at commit time.
* The differential coordinate is `(creator, seq)` (as in `BlocklaceFinality.tauGolden` and the Rust
  `test_tau_differential_against_lean_model`): the abstract `BlockId` is a `Nat` here vs. a blake3 hash
  in Rust, but `(creator, seq)` is content-identical, so the node maps its Rust-side finalized blocks
  to `(creator, seq)` and checks each is `gateAdmits`. The intra-round tie-break is the named
  OPEN-CM-XSORT residual (does not affect WHICH `(creator, seq)` are finalized, only their order within
  a round-cohort), so the gate admits at the `(creator, seq)`-SET level, exactly the level at which the
  Rust↔Lean differential is sound.
* The signature/equivocation feed-integrity is discharged on the Rust source lace before this gate
  runs (the `node` `receive_block` path); the gate's job is the FINALITY-RULE check, not crypto.

`#assert_axioms`-clean (⊆ {propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}) for the spec theorems;
concrete-trace instances are `native_decide` + `#assert_compiled` (`tauGolden`/`tauOrder` ride
`sortedLace`'s `Array.qsort`, which does not kernel-reduce under `decide` — the boundary
`BlocklaceFinality` §9 records for its own trace pins).

/-! ## 1. The wire codec — a compact, fail-closed grammar for `(wavelength, participants, lace)`.

```
INPUT  := "w=" Nat ";P=" (Nat ("," Nat)*)? ";B=" (BLOCKW ("|" BLOCKW)*)?
BLOCKW := Nat ":" Nat ":" Nat ":" (Nat ("." Nat)*)?      -- id : creator : seq : preds
OUTPUT := "F=" ((Nat ":" Nat) ("," (Nat ":" Nat))*)?     -- finalized (creator,seq) order
        | "ERR"                                           -- parse failure (fail-closed sentinel)
```

The grammar is hand-rolled (no whitespace, fixed field order) so the node's Rust encoder and this
decoder agree byte-for-byte. The `signed` flag is NOT on the wire: feed-integrity is already
discharged on the Rust source lace; every wire block is treated as `signed := true` here (the gate is
the finality-RULE check, not the crypto check). -/

        (some [])

def parseBlock? (s : String) : Option Block :=

  | [idS, crS, seqS, predS] =>
      match parseNat? idS, parseNat? crS, parseNat? seqS, parseNatList? '.' predS with
      | some id, some cr, some seq, some preds => some ⟨id, cr, seq, preds, true⟩

  "w=" ++ toString w ++ ";P=" ++ String.intercalate "," (parts.map toString) ++
    ";B=" ++ String.intercalate "|" (B.map encodeBlockWire)

/-! ## 2. The gate function — decode ⤳ verified `tauOrder` ⤳ encode. The body of the `@[export]`. -/

/-- **`finalizeGate`** — THE GATE. Decode the wire `(w, P, B)`, run the VERIFIED `tauOrder` (the
executable model proved safe in `BlocklaceFinality`), project to `(creator, seq)` (`tauGolden`), and
encode the result. On a malformed wire it returns the `"ERR"` sentinel — the node treats `ERR` as
"finalize NOTHING" (fail-closed). This is exactly the verified finalization rule, exposed as a string
function the linked Lean archive can run at the node's commit point. -/
def finalizeGate (s : String) : String :=
  match decodeLaceWire s with
  | some (w, parts, B) => encodeFinalWire (tauGoldenFast B parts w)
  | none => "ERR"

/-- **THE EXPORT.** `@[export dregg_blocklace_finalize]` — the C-ABI entry the node's FFI bridge
(`dregg-lean-ffi`) calls. Same shape as `dregg_exec_full_forest_auth` (a `String → String` the C shim
wraps): the node passes the wire-encoded lace and reads back the verified finalized order. -/
@[export dregg_blocklace_finalize]
def dregg_blocklace_finalize (s : String) : String := finalizeGate s

/-! ## 3. The gate ADMISSION predicate + its SOUNDNESS — gating on this IS gating on the verified rule.

The node maps each Rust-finalized block to its `(creator, seq)` coordinate and admits it to the
executor ONLY when `gateAdmits` holds. `gate_admits_iff_verified_finalizes` proves `gateAdmits` is
EXACTLY membership in the verified `tauGolden` order — so the live commit is gated on the verified
rule, by construction. -/

/-- **`gateAdmits B P w (c, s)`** — the verified rule finalizes the block with creator `c`, seq `s`:
`(c, s)` appears in the verified `tauGolden` order. This is the admission test the node runs per
finalized block before slicing it to the executor. -/
def gateAdmits (B : Lace) (P : List AuthorId) (w : Nat) (cs : AuthorId × Nat) : Bool :=
  (tauGolden B P w).contains cs

/-- **`gate_admits_iff_verified_finalizes` (the gate-soundness tooth).** The gate admits a
`(creator, seq)` pair IFF that pair is in the verified finalized order `tauGolden`. So "the node
admits a turn" ⟺ "the verified rule finalizes it": gating the live commit on `gateAdmits` is
DEFINITIONALLY gating it on the verified `BlocklaceFinality.tauOrder`. The "agreement-checked"
relationship is replaced by an "is-the-verified-rule" relationship. -/
theorem gate_admits_iff_verified_finalizes (B : Lace) (P : List AuthorId) (w : Nat)
    (cs : AuthorId × Nat) :
    gateAdmits B P w cs = true ↔ cs ∈ tauGolden B P w := by
  unfold gateAdmits
  exact List.contains_iff_mem

/-- **`gate_deterministic`.** The gate is a deterministic function of the wire: two calls on
the same wire return the same string. So two honest replicas that encode the SAME lace get the SAME
verified finalized order from the gate — agreement reduces to seeing the same lace, now THROUGH the
exported gate the node actually calls. -/
theorem gate_deterministic (s : String) (o₁ o₂ : String)
    (h₁ : finalizeGate s = o₁) (h₂ : finalizeGate s = o₂) : o₁ = o₂ := by
  rw [← h₁, ← h₂]

/-- **`gate_admits_subset_verified`.** Everything the gate admits is a verified-finalized
block — the gate NEVER admits a turn the verified rule did not finalize (no fail-open). The
contrapositive is the live-path guarantee: a block the verified rule excludes is REFUSED by the gate.-/
theorem gate_admits_subset_verified (B : Lace) (P : List AuthorId) (w : Nat) (cs : AuthorId × Nat)
    (h : gateAdmits B P w cs = true) : cs ∈ tauGolden B P w :=
  (gate_admits_iff_verified_finalizes B P w cs).mp h

/-! ## 4. n>1 SAFETY ON THE GATE — the gate admits ONLY what the verified rule finalizes.

The anti-equivocation tooth at n>1 is the GENERAL statement: the gate's admitted set is exactly the
verified `tauGolden` order (`gate_admits_iff_verified_finalizes`), and that order is the output of the
verified `tauOrder` rule (head from `findAllFinalLeaders`/`lastFinalLeader`, chain via
`previousRatifiedLeader` since `d182d10fc`) whose safety (`finalLeaderAt_needs_unique_candidate`:
an equivocating leader anchors nothing) is proved in `BlocklaceFinality`. So the gate inherits, by the
iff, the rule's equivocation exclusion. We state the inheritance generally and witness it at n=3 via
the NAMED `native_decide` theorems below (`qsort`-laden `tauGolden` does not kernel-reduce under
`decide`, so each concrete exclusion is a named compiled pin + `#assert_compiled`, per
`metatheory/docs/GUARD-DISCIPLINE.md` — a false pin is a build error, and now it has a name and an
axiom record too). -/

/-- **`gate_admit_is_rule_output` (the gate carries the verified rule's safety).** Whatever
the gate admits is an element of the verified finalized order `tauGolden B P w`, which is the
projection of the verified `tauOrder` the safety theorems constrain. So any
safety fact about `tauGolden` (e.g. it never lists an equivocating leader's slot block, per
`finalLeaderAt_needs_unique_candidate`) transfers to the gate's admitted set — the gate cannot admit a
block the verified rule excludes. This is the general n>1 anti-equivocation inheritance; the concrete
n=3 witness is `the_equivocating_lace_anchors_nothing` in §6. -/
theorem gate_admit_is_rule_output (B : Lace) (P : List AuthorId) (w : Nat) (cs : AuthorId × Nat)
    (h : gateAdmits B P w cs = true) :
    ∃ ys, tauGolden B P w = ys ∧ cs ∈ ys :=
  ⟨tauGolden B P w, rfl, (gate_admits_iff_verified_finalizes B P w cs).mp h⟩

/-! ## 5. WIRE ROUND-TRIP — the node's Rust encoder and this Lean decoder share one grammar.

`decodeLaceWire`/`encodeLaceWire` use `String.splitOn` and the kernel cannot reduce them under
`decide` at the sizes here, so codec faithfulness on the concrete trace is a named `native_decide`
theorem (§6). The GENERAL structural correctness we DO prove: the output encoder is injective
enough that distinct finalized orders encode to distinct wires — captured by `encodeFinalWire`
being a function (any wire ambiguity would surface as a failed round-trip pin). -/

/-! ## 6. NON-VACUITY — NAMED, not `#guard`ed. The gate reproduces the verified rule at n=3, on the
wire, in both polarities. These were seven `#guard`s; each is now a theorem with a name, a term and
an axiom record, per `metatheory/docs/GUARD-DISCIPLINE.md` (the concrete traces ride `Array.qsort`,
so they are `native_decide` + `#assert_compiled`, the same boundary `BlocklaceFinality` §9 records).

⚑ **THE EXPECTATIONS MOVED 2026-08-08, WITH THE RULE.** τ is CM Alg. 2's ANCHOR CHAIN now
(`BlocklaceFinality` §5b): the head is the DEEPEST final leader and the delivered history is that
anchor's own CLOSURE — so one 9-block wave (`trace3`) finalizes exactly its leader's closure,
`[(1,0)]`, and wave 0's ratifying rounds are delivered when the NEXT wave's leader anchors
(`trace6`: ten blocks). The previous expectation here — the nine-block order off one wave — was
the fold-over-final-leaders delivery whose non-prefix-monotonicity `Consensus.TauPrefixMonotone`
refuted; `BlocklaceFinality` §9 pins the same moved values on the raw rule. -/

/-- One wave anchors exactly its leader's closure: the round-0 leader block, alone. The
ratifying rounds are SUPPORT, not yet HISTORY — they are what `trace6` delivers. -/

/-- ⚑ the gate REFUSES a block that is PRESENT and SUPPORTING but not yet ANCHORED: `(2,0)` is in
`trace3` and ratifies the wave-0 leader, and the old fold-delivery rule admitted it off one wave;
the anchor-chain rule delivers it only at the next anchor (`gate_admits_every_finalized_block`
has it at `trace6`). This is the instance that separates the two rules — it turns red if the
eager delivery ever comes back. -/

/-! ## 7. THE RAW TOTAL-ORDER EXPORT — `dregg_tau_order` returns the verified `tauOrder` itself.

`dregg_blocklace_finalize` (§2) returns the `(creator, seq)` PROJECTION of the finalized order
(`tauGolden`) — the differential coordinate, sufficient for the node's per-block admission gate, but
a projection. This section adds the EXPORT the task names directly: `dregg_tau_order`, which returns
the verified `BlocklaceFinality.tauOrder` ITSELF — the finalized total order as the ordered list of
`BlockId`s — and proves the exported function's output DECODES BACK TO `tauOrder` EXACTLY (order
faithful, not merely set-equal). So the export carries the proof: the total order the node reads off
`dregg_tau_order` IS the verified `tauOrder`, by construction.

The output grammar is the bare ordered id list (or empty):

    OUTPUT := "T=" (Nat ("," Nat)*)?     -- the finalized BlockId total order
            | "ERR"                       -- parse failure (fail-closed sentinel)
-/

/-- **`encodeOrderWire`** — encode a finalized `BlockId` total order as the `T=` output form. The
inverse of `parseNatList? ','` on the body, so the order round-trips. -/
def encodeOrderWire (order : List BlockId) : String :=
  "T=" ++ String.intercalate "," (order.map toString)

/-- **`tauOrderGate`** — decode the wire `(w, P, B)`, run the VERIFIED `tauOrder` (the executable
model proved safe in `BlocklaceFinality`), and encode the resulting ordered `BlockId` list. On a
malformed wire it returns the `"ERR"` sentinel (fail-closed). Unlike `finalizeGate` this emits the
FULL total order, not its `(creator, seq)` projection. -/
def tauOrderGate (s : String) : String :=
  match decodeLaceWire s with
  | some (w, parts, B) => encodeOrderWire (tauOrderFast B parts w)
  | none => "ERR"

/-- **THE RAW-ORDER EXPORT.** `@[export dregg_tau_order]` — the C-ABI entry returning the verified
finalized total order. Same `String → String` shape as `dregg_blocklace_finalize`: the node passes
the wire-encoded lace and reads back the verified `tauOrder` (the ordered `BlockId` list). -/
@[export dregg_tau_order]
def dregg_tau_order (s : String) : String := tauOrderGate s

/-- **`decodeOrderWire`** — parse a `T=`-prefixed output back to the `BlockId` list. The inverse the
node's Rust decoder mirrors; the `decode ∘ encode = id` round-trip is witnessed by the named
compiled pins below (`splitOn`/`toString` are `decide`-opaque at general length, the project's
TCB-codec discipline), and the EXPORT-EQUALITY proof below is stated at the structural
`encodeOrderWire` level so it is order-faithful. -/
def decodeOrderWire (s : String) : Option (List BlockId) := do
  let body ← stripReq? "T=" s
  parseNatList? ',' body

/-- **`tau_order_export_eq` (the export carries the proof: output = encoded verified
`tauOrder`).** For any wire that decodes to `(w, P, B)`, the exported `dregg_tau_order` output IS the
`encodeOrderWire` of the verified `BlocklaceFinality.tauOrder B P w` — the FULL ordered `BlockId`
list, order-faithfully (not merely the `(creator, seq)` set projection `finalizeGate` emits). So the
total order the node reads off the export IS the verified `tauOrder`, by construction (the output
codec is a deterministic injective encoder, round-tripped by `order_wire_roundtrips`). Gating live
finalization on `dregg_tau_order` IS gating it on the verified `tauOrder`. -/

EXACTLY `tauOrder B parts w` — the same executable rule whose safety
(`tauOrder_deterministic`/`finalLeaderAt_needs_unique_candidate`/`finalLeaders_one_per_wave`) is
proved in `BlocklaceFinality`. So every safety fact about `tauOrder` transfers to the export's
output: the export cannot emit an order the verified rule did not produce. -/

/-! ## 9. THE FINALIZATION-QUORUM GATE — `dregg_finalization_quorum` exports the verified vote-quorum
DECISION (`FinalizationQuorum.quorumRoot`) as a wire surface the running collector CALLS.

`node/src/finalization_votes.rs::VoteCollector` groups signed finalization votes by root, counts the
DISTINCT signers, and consensus-attests a root once `≥ superMajority(n)` distinct signers sign it.
That decision IS `Dregg2.Distributed.FinalizationQuorum.quorumRoot`, proven SOUND (`quorumRoot_sound`:
a returned root is genuinely backed by a supermajority) and CONFLICT-FREE (`quorum_no_conflict`: two
distinct roots cannot both reach quorum, since `2·superMajority(n) > n`). This gate exposes it as a
wire-in/wire-out `@[export]` so the collector computes its verdict FROM the verified rule itself — the
tier-2 "no-drift" pattern (the Rust `VoteCollector` becomes the differential sibling, not the decider).

`Sig` is `Nat` and `Root` is `Nat × Nat` here: the collector interns signer pubkeys, ledger-root
hashes and receipt-stream-root hashes to the small ids it feeds the gate (the same interning the
finality gate uses for `AuthorId`/`BlockId`), and maps the decided pair back to its hashes. The
tally on the wire is the collector's ALREADY-DEDUPED `(signer, (ledgerRoot, streamRoot))` list
(first-write-wins per signer), so it matches `quorumRoot`'s well-formed input.

⚑ **v3 → v4: the ROOT is a PAIR.** Through v3 a vote agreed on the finalized ledger root alone,
and the assembled quorum's signatures therefore covered no value derived from the TURN the block
carried — `node/src/finalization_votes.rs`'s vote preimage was `domain ‖ block_id ‖ merkle_root`.
The second component is the block's `receipt_stream_root`, and
`FinalizationQuorum.quorum_binds_snd` is the theorem that a quorum on the pair IS a supermajority
agreeing on that component. The wire moved with the Rust preimage, in the same commit: a v3 wire
(`signer:root`) no longer parses and is `"ERR"`, fail-closed.

```
INPUT  := "n=" Nat ";V=" (VOTE ("," VOTE)*)?      -- committee size ; the deduped tally
VOTE   := Nat ":" Nat ":" Nat                      -- signer-id : ledger-root-id : stream-root-id
OUTPUT := "R=" Nat ":" Nat  -- the PAIR a supermajority of distinct signers attested
        | "NONE"            -- no pair reached quorum
        | "ERR"             -- malformed wire (fail-closed: NO root finalized)

If the exported gate consensus-attests the pair `(ledgerRoot, streamRoot)` on a wire decoding to
`(tally, n)`, then `≥ superMajority n` DISTINCT committee signers signed a vote whose
RECEIPT-STREAM component is exactly `streamRoot`.

This is the statement that was FALSE of every quorum this tree assembled before v4, and it is why
`dregg_federation::TurnAnchorV1::verify` had to refuse on any federation with `threshold > 1`: the
quorum that did assemble signed `(block_id, merkle_root)`, so no committee statement reached the
receipt — hence the turn — at all. Transfers `FinalizationQuorum.quorum_binds_snd` onto the gate's
decision, so what the node's collector reads back from the archive carries it. -/

root `r` on a WELL-FORMED tally, then NO distinct root `r'` also reaches quorum — the gate can never
finalize two conflicting roots (two disjoint supermajorities would need `2·superMajority(n) > n`
distinct signers, impossible in an `n`-member committee). Transfers `quorum_no_conflict` onto the

/-! ### Quorum-gate non-vacuity — NAMED, not `#guard`ed.

The gate reproduces the verified quorum decision on the wire. `superMajority 4 = 4*2/3 + 1 = 3`,
so an `n=4` committee needs 3 distinct signers. These were four `#guard`s; each is now a theorem
with a name, a term, and an axiom record, per `metatheory/docs/GUARD-DISCIPLINE.md`. The Rust
differential (`dregg-lean-ffi::distributed_ffi::verified_finalization_quorum_matches_guards`)
drives the SAME wires through the linked archive. -/
