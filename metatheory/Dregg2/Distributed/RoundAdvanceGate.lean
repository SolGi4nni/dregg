# Dregg2.Distributed.RoundAdvanceGate — the EVENTUAL-SYNCHRONY round-advance gate
# (Cordial Miners Alg. 4 lines 67–75), authored HERE and exported to the node.

**The defect this closes** (`docs/reference/READING-DAG-BFT-2026-08-08.md` §5.3). Cordial Miners
(arXiv:2205.09174) gives TWO protocol instances that differ in *both* leader election and round
advance, and §6.2 says the pairing is deliberate:

  * ASYNCHRONY (w = 5): retrospective shared-coin leader, advance **as soon as the round is
    cordial** (Alg. 4:59 — `es_advance_round` is a no-op).
  * EVENTUAL SYNCHRONY (w = 3): prospective round-robin leader, advance **only when the leader
    block is present / ratified / super-ratified — or a timeout fires** (Alg. 4:67–75).

The node runs the ES half of leader election (`wave_leader`, round-robin, published in genesis)
with the ASYNC half of round advance (`node/src/blocklace_sync.rs::plan_round_block` — cordiality
alone, no leader clause, no timer). CM §6.2, on why the ES clauses exist: *"These conditions are to
prevent the adversary from ordering the messages after GST, in particular, the leader block and the
blocks that super-ratify it, **as the leader is known in advance**."* And CM Prop. 38 (ES
leader-liveness w.p. 1) is stated **only** under `timeout > ∆`. The mixed halves are a LIVENESS
hole: an adversary controlling delivery keeps the (publicly known) leader's block out of the
fastest 2f+1 arrivals at each wave-start round and no wave ever anchors; and without any adversary,
a persistently slow leader loses its `1/n` of all waves, deterministically.

**This module is the missing half, authored in Lean** (consensus rules are AUTHORED IN LEAN; Rust
only calls the exported artifact). It defines the line-67 predicate over the SAME executable
vocabulary as the verified finalization rule (`BlocklaceFinality`: `roundOf`, `waveLeader`,
`leaderCandidates`, `approves`, `isSuperRatified`), proves the spec-level facts the node relies on,
and exposes the decision as `@[export] dregg_round_advance` (the `FinalityGate` /
`StrandAdmission` wire template). `node/src/blocklace_sync.rs::produce_round_block` consults it
before honoring a `RoundPlan::Advance`.

## The rule, translated to this repo's 1-indexed rounds

CM's rounds are 0-indexed (wave-start ⟺ `r mod w = 0`); the node's are 1-indexed with wave 0 =
rounds `[1, w]` (`ordering.rs::round_to_wave`), so the wave POSITION of round `r` is
`(r − 1) mod w`. For the round `r` a producer wants to COMPLETE (it is at `my_max_round = r` and
wants to author `r+1`):

```
advanceGate B P w r timeout :=
  cordialRound r                    -- Alg. 1:25–26: a supermajority of distinct enrolled
                                    --   participants have a block at round r
  ∧ ( pos = 0     ⟹ the wave leader has a block at round r            -- Alg. 4:69–70
    ∧ pos = 1     ⟹ that leader block is ratified by prefix(r)        -- Alg. 4:71–72
    ∧ pos = w − 1 ⟹ that leader block is SUPER-ratified at round r    -- Alg. 4:73–74
    ∨ timeout )                                                       -- Alg. 4:75
```

`timeout` is an INPUT BIT, deliberately: the CLOCK is I/O and lives in Rust (the node measures
elapsed time from the first instant round `r` was observed cordial, against the configured
`round_advance_timeout_ms`, which MUST exceed the assumed post-GST delay bound ∆ — Prop. 38's
hypothesis; the node states its ∆ assumption where the config is defined). The RULE — what the bit
unlocks and what it never unlocks — is decided here. `timeout_does_not_bypass_cordiality` pins the
never-half: CM's line 68 conjunction puts cordiality OUTSIDE the `∨ timeout`.

## Two deliberate deviations from the paper's letter, both named

1. **The wave-end clause uses the DEPLOYED finality predicate** `isSuperRatified` (ratifiers
   counted among WAVE-END-round blocks only, B6-enrollment-gated) rather than the paper's
   `super_ratifies(blocklace_prefix(r), b)` (ratifiers anywhere in the prefix). Wave-end-only
   ratifier counting is what `finalLeaderAt` — the rule that decides whether the wave ANCHORS —
   actually requires, so gating on it makes "advance past the wave end" wait for exactly the
   condition finality needs, not a weaker cousin that can pass while τ still skips the wave. It is
   STRICTER than the paper's clause (wave-end blocks ⊆ prefix blocks), and the `∨ timeout` arm is
   untouched, so Prop. 38's liveness argument (which only needs the timeout arm plus post-GST
   delivery) is unaffected.
2. **Cordiality counts ENROLLED participants only** (the B6 ratifier-enrollment discipline),
   where the Rust `plan_round_block` counts ANY distinct creator at the round. An unenrolled
   creator's block must not help a round LOOK complete any more than it may help a leader look
   super-ratified. The Rust cordiality check stays as the cheap pre-filter and diagnostic
   (`RoundPlan::Wait` carries the wedge telemetry); THIS predicate is the decider, and it is the
   stricter of the two, so the composition (Rust-cordial ∧ this gate) equals this gate.

The middle-round clause (`pos = 1`, and every non-end position for a hypothetical `w ≠ 3`;
deployed `w = 3` — `ordering.rs::OrderingConfig::default`, `node/src/finality_gate.rs::WAVELENGTH`)
is the paper's `ratifies(blocklace_prefix(r), b)` transliterated (`prefixRatifies`), with the
approver count enrollment-filtered for the same B6 reason. `wavelength = 0` is out of contract and
fails the clause (the gate then advances only on cordial ∧ timeout — fail-safe, never fail-open).

## What this module does NOT do

It does not change WHO the leader is (`waveLeader` stays round-robin — completing the ES instance,
not switching to the async one, is the design choice; the async instance needs a retrospective
shared coin this tree does not have), does not touch τ / finalization, and does not measure time.

`#assert_axioms`-clean (⊆ {propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}) for the spec theorems;
concrete-trace instances are `native_decide` + `#assert_compiled` (the round map rides
`sortedLace`'s `Array.qsort`, which does not kernel-reduce under `decide` — the same boundary
`FinalityGate` §4 records). Verified with `lake build Dregg2.Distributed.RoundAdvanceGate`.

/-- **`cordialRound`** — CM Alg. 1:25–26 `cordial_round(r)`: a supermajority of distinct ENROLLED
participants have a block at round `r`. This is the ONLY clause the node's `plan_round_block`
checks today (with the divergence that it counts any creator; see the module docstring — this
enrolled count is the decider, and stricter). -/

distinct ENROLLED participants have a block at depth ≤ `r` that `approves` the leader block `l`
(the prefix is downward-closed, so "in the closure of the prefix" is "at depth ≤ r"). The
`pos = 1` clause of Alg. 4:71–72 ("second round of the wave: the round-(r−1) leader is ratified"). -/

round `r`. The wave-start leader blocks are `leaderCandidates` (creator = `waveLeader`, depth =
wave-start round); `∃b` in the paper is `List.any` here — an equivocating leader (two slot blocks)
can still satisfy the clause, and that is CORRECT for an ADVANCE gate: τ will skip such a wave
regardless (`finalLeaderAt` requires a UNIQUE candidate), and holding the round for it would buy
nothing but the timeout. `wavelength = 0` fails the clause (out of contract, fail-safe). -/

/-- **THE GATE** — CM Alg. 4:67–75 for one round: complete round `r` (author `r+1`) iff the round
is cordial AND (the leader clause holds OR the timeout fired). `timeoutFired` is the Rust-measured
clock bit (elapsed-since-cordial ≥ `round_advance_timeout_ms > ∆`); the rule around it is decided
here. Note the conjunction shape: cordiality is OUTSIDE the disjunction — a timeout never advances
a round the committee has not filled (`timeout_does_not_bypass_cordiality`). -/

The refusal pole needs a lace that is CORDIAL-BUT-LEADERLESS, or the refusal theorem is satisfied
by any starving round and says nothing about the leader clause. At n=3 that shape cannot exist
(`superMajority 3 = 3` — every cordial round contains everyone), so the witness is n=4
(`superMajority 4 = 3`): creators 2,3,4 fill round 1, the wave-0 round-robin leader (participant
1) is silent. `noLeader_r1_cordial` is the anti-vacuity leg — the refusal below is attributable to
