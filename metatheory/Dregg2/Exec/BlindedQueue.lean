# Dregg2.Exec.BlindedQueue — the "commitments-in, nullifiers-out" private-consumption queue.

`STORAGE-AS-CELL-PROGRAMS.md §3.4`: a `BlindedQueue` is **not a new Effect** — it is a **cell**
whose state is a commitments set (blinded items *added*), a nullifier set (items *spent*), and
two monotone counts (`countAdded`/`countSpent`, with `countSpent ≤ countAdded`). It is the
canonical privacy-voting / sealed-bid primitive: a producer enqueues a *blinded* commitment, and
a consumer privately spends it by publishing a *nullifier* (revealing nothing about *which* item)
together with a ZK **spend proof**. Per `PREDICATE-INVENTORY.md §9.4` it is the ONLY storage
primitive needing a `Witnessed` spend predicate — and that predicate is exactly the `dregg2 §8`
verify oracle.

We **reuse, never redefine**:
- `NullifierCell.Cell` (the G-Set of consumed nullifiers) + `spend` + its anti-double-spend law
  `spend_no_double_spend` for the *anti-double-spend half* (§3.4 slot 1 / slot 5: `nullifier_root`
  monotone, double-spend rejected). We do NOT touch the nullifier-set discipline; we wrap it.
- `CryptoKernel.verify` (the `dregg2 §8` decidable spend oracle) for the *privacy-gate half*
  (§3.4 slot 6: `spend_air_vk`). A `consume` is admissible only when `verify spendStmt proof`
  accepts — the witnessed `WitnessedPredicate::Custom { vk_hash }` of §3.4 made into an interface
  obligation we USE. Its soundness/extractability is the CIRCUIT obligation, NEVER a Lean law.

Headline theorems (both proved):
- `blinded_no_double_spend` — a nullifier already spent cannot be consumed again (lifted from
  `NullifierCell.spend_no_double_spend`).
- `consume_needs_verify` — a committed `consume` implies `CryptoKernel.verify` accepted the
  spend proof: the privacy gate.
- `countSpent_le_added` — spent never exceeds added, preserved by every transition.

Parametric over `[CryptoKernel Digest Proof]`, so every theorem holds for *any* lawful kernel
(the abstract proving instance) AND for the Rust FFI one (the running instance). The `#eval`
demos run against the `Reference` kernel in `CryptoKernel.lean`.

Pure, computable, `#eval`-able. No `axiom`/`admit`/`native_decide`/`sorry`.

/-! ## The state — commitments added, nullifiers spent (reusing the `NullifierCell`), and counts. -/

/-- **A `BlindedQueue` state** (`STORAGE-AS-CELL-PROGRAMS §3.4`, name-keyed not 8-slot):
- `commitments` — the set of blinded item commitments *added* (the §3.4 `commitments_root`,
  modelled as the live `Finset` of digests rather than a Merkle digest; grow-only).
- `nullifiers`  — the spent-nullifier set, REUSING `NullifierCell.Cell` *unchanged* (the §3.4
  `nullifier_root`; its append-only / anti-double-spend discipline is the cell's own law).
- `countAdded` / `countSpent` — the monotone counters (`commitment_count` / `nullifier_count`),
  with the standing invariant `countSpent ≤ countAdded` (a spend consumes an added item).

`Digest` is the commitment carrier (the `CryptoKernel`'s hash/commit codomain). -/
structure State (Digest : Type) where
  /-- The blinded commitments added so far (grow-only; the `commitments_root` live set). -/
  commitments : Finset Digest
  /-- The spent-nullifier set — the reused `NullifierCell.Cell` (its own append-only law). -/
  nullifiers : NullifierCell.Cell
  /-- Number of items added (monotone ↑). -/
  countAdded : Nat
  /-- Number of items spent (monotone ↑); standing invariant `countSpent ≤ countAdded`. -/
  countSpent : Nat

/-- The empty queue: nothing added, nothing spent (the genesis state). -/
def empty [DecidableEq Digest] : State Digest :=
  { commitments := ∅, nullifiers := NullifierCell.empty, countAdded := 0, countSpent := 0 }

/-! ## `add` — enqueue a blinded commitment (monotone, fail-open: adding is always allowed). -/

/-- **`add s c`** — the producer enqueues a blinded commitment `c`. Insert it into the
commitments set and bump `countAdded`. This is grow-only (`STORAGE-AS-CELL-PROGRAMS §3.4`:
"commitments only added"): no commitment is ever removed. Adding never spends, so the
`countSpent ≤ countAdded` invariant is *preserved* (the gap only widens). -/
def add [DecidableEq Digest] (s : State Digest) (c : Digest) : State Digest :=
  { s with commitments := insert c s.commitments, countAdded := s.countAdded + 1 }

/-! ## `consume` — privately spend an item (fail-closed; the two-gate AND of §3.4). -/

/-- **`consume s spendStmt proof n`** — the consumer privately spends, publishing nullifier `n`
under the spend statement `spendStmt : Digest` with witness `proof : Proof`. It is the AND of
**both** §3.4 gates, fail-closed (`none` on either failure):

1. **The privacy gate** (`CryptoKernel.verify spendStmt proof = true`) — the `dregg2 §8`
   witnessed spend predicate (§3.4 slot 6). You may not spend without a valid spend proof. Its
   soundness is the circuit obligation; here it is the decidable oracle the cell consults.
2. **The anti-double-spend gate** (`NullifierCell.spend s.nullifiers n` succeeds) — `n` must be
   *fresh* in the spent set, REUSING the nullifier cell's own append-only `spend`. A re-presented
   nullifier is rejected by `NullifierCell`'s law.

On success: the nullifier is recorded (via the reused cell) and `countSpent` is bumped. -/
def consume (s : State Digest) (spendStmt : Digest) (proof : Proof) (n : Nullifier) :
    Option (State Digest) :=
  if CryptoKernel.verify spendStmt proof then
    match NullifierCell.spend s.nullifiers n with
    | some nz => some { s with nullifiers := nz, countSpent := s.countSpent + 1 }

  else
    none                                    -- spend proof rejected ⇒ fail-closed (privacy gate)

/-- If nullifier `n` is already in the spent set, `consume` returns `none` regardless of the
spend proof. Delegates to `NullifierCell.spend_rejects_double`; the verify gate cannot rescue an
already-spent nullifier. -/
