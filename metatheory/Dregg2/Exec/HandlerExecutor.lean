# Dregg2.Exec.HandlerExecutor — THE CUTOVER KEYSTONE (additive; the live switch is mechanical).

This is the file the seven handler batches were built FOR. It assembles them into ONE executor that is a
DROP-IN, SOUNDNESS-STRENGTHENING replacement for `TurnExecutorFull.execFullA`, and proves the global
conservation/gate laws for it WITHOUT a per-arm matrix — by LIFTING the scaffold's generic `turn_conserves`
/ `turn_head_authorized` / `turn_head_admitted` (`Dregg2.Exec.Handler`). This is additive: it does NOT edit
`execFullA`/`FullActionA`; switching the call-sites is a later mechanical step.

The five deliverables:

  1. **`masterRegistry`** (`§2`) — the coproduct `Registry = List PackedHandler` packing ALL the proved
     handlers across the seven files (transfer / mint / burn / state-write / createCell / escrow /
     release / refund / note / seal / unseal / seal-pair / swiss-export/enliven/handoff/drop / delegate /
     attenuate / revoke / bridge-lock/finalize/
     cancel / pipelined-send / exercise). Every entry's obligation proofs are a TYPING condition on entry.

  2. **`toClosedEffect`** (`§3`) — the TOTAL map `FullActionA → ClosedEffect` mapping each of the 56
     constructors to its handler + args, ALIASES collapsed (obligation→escrow, committed→escrow,
     introduce/validateHandoff→delegateAtten, slash→release, fulfill→refund, bridgeMint→mint,
     createCellFromFactory/spawn→createCell, dropRef/revokeDelegation→revoke, the lifecycle/emit
     family→a live-gated state write). 56/56 constructors covered.

  3. **`execHandlerTurn`** (`§4`) — `List FullActionA → RecChainedState → Option RecChainedState`: map
     `toClosedEffect`, run each `ClosedEffect`'s `step` on the `.kernel`, thread the state through the
     scaffold's generic `execTurn` (the `.log` carries the audit trace).

  4. **THE DERIVED GLOBAL CONSERVATION** (`§5`) — `execHandlerTurn_conserves`: the combined per-asset
     measure `recTotalAsset` (over `.kernel`; log-independent) moves by the SUM of the
     per-effect deltas, proved by LIFTING the scaffold's generic `turn_conserves` (NOT a 56-arm cases
     matrix — THIS is the matrix-killer demonstrated at full scale). Plus the gate companions
     (`execHandlerTurn_head_authorized` / `_admitted`) lifted from `turn_head_authorized`/`_admitted`.

  5. **THE STRENGTHENING** (`§6`) — `handler_refines_execFullA_*`: the handler executor is a SOUND
     STRENGTHENING of `execFullA`: for the hole-closing effects (a transfer R1, an escrow-release R2, a
     state-write R6) every commit the handler executor makes, `execFullA` ALSO makes, AND they AGREE on
     the kernel. The handlers only ADD gates.

  6. **THE TEETH** (`§7`) — concrete attacks `execFullA` ADMITS but `execHandlerTurn` REJECTS: a transfer
     into a Sealed cell (R1), an escrow-release by a stranger (R2), a state-write into a Sealed cell (R6).
     `#eval`-verified: `execFullA = some` (the live hole) vs `execHandlerTurn = none` (the algebra closes
     it). The cutover STRICTLY improves soundness.

The conservation keystone REUSES `turn_conserves` (generic) — it is NEVER re-derived. Verified
standalone: `lake build Dregg2.Exec.HandlerExecutor`.

/-! ## §1 — Pretty names for the master registry indices (the audit-trail tags).

Each `ClosedEffect` already carries the registry `tag` its batch assigned (the coproduct injection key);
`toClosedEffect` (`§3`) reuses each batch's `ClosedEffect` builder VERBATIM, so the tags it emits are the
batch-local ones. The master registry below LISTS every handler so the executor's dispatch is one LOOKUP
over the coproduct — the 56-arm `match` of `execFullA` collapsed into a list. -/

/-! ## §2 — `masterRegistry`: the coproduct (LIST) of ALL the proved handlers, seven batches assembled.

This is the master menu. Each entry is one `PackedHandler` carrying a handler whose obligation proofs are
DISCHARGED (the structure literal would not type-check otherwise). The generic `turn_conserves` /
`turn_head_authorized` / `turn_head_admitted` are generic over THIS list — adding an effect is adding one
well-typed entry, never a lemma. -/

/-- **`masterRegistry`** — the coproduct of all proved handlers across the seven batches. The 56-effect
op-set as a single list; the executor dispatches by LOOKUP, not a bespoke `match`. -/

/-! ## §3 — `toClosedEffect`: the TOTAL `FullActionA → ClosedEffect` dispatch (56/56 constructors).

This is the cutover's heart: it sends every `FullActionA` constructor to the registered handler that
implements it, plus its concrete args, by REUSING each batch's `ClosedEffect` builder verbatim (so the
obligation proofs come along for free). The ALIASING is the dregg2 dispatch collapse the catalog already
records: an obligation IS an escrow, a slash IS a release-to-beneficiary, a fulfil IS a refund-to-obligor,
an introduce / validate-handoff IS an attenuated delegation, a bridge-mint IS a mint, a factory/spawn IS a
born-empty createCell, a dropRef / revoke-delegation IS a target revocation. (F1b: the escrow/
obligation/committed-escrow/bridge-LFC constructors are GONE — the factory contracts own them.)

The lifecycle/emit family (`emitEventA` / `cellSealA` / `cellUnsealA` / `cellDestroyA` /
`refreshDelegationA`) routes to the dedicated `Lifecycle` handlers (real `lifecycle`/`deathCert`/
`delegations` side-table edits + authority-free emit membership gate). The seven named-field writes
(`setFieldA` / `incrementNonceA` / `setPermissionsA` / `setVKA` / `makeSovereignA` / `refusalA` /
`receiptArchiveA`) map onto the GENERIC live-gated `stateWriteH`. -/

/-- **`toClosedEffect`** — the TOTAL dispatch map (every one of the 56 `FullActionA` constructors). Each
arm reuses its batch's `ClosedEffect` builder, so the looked-up handler's obligation proofs are carried.
Aliases collapse onto one handler; the field-write/lifecycle family routes through the generic
live-gated `stateWriteEffect` at a pinned field name (closing R6 for the whole family). -/

/-! ## §4 — `execHandlerTurn`: the registry executor over the chained state.

Map each `FullActionA` to its `ClosedEffect` via `toClosedEffect`, run the looked-up handler's
fail-closed `step` on the `.kernel`, and thread the kernel through the scaffold's generic `execTurn`
(the `List.foldlM` all-or-nothing transaction). The `.log` carries the audit trace: each committed
effect appends its handler's `trace` Turn. This is the executable shadow that REPLACES `execFullA` —
additive here, the call-sites switch later. -/

/-- The closed-effect list a chained turn dispatches to (the cutover's per-turn dispatch table). -/
def closedOf (acts : List FullActionA) : List ClosedEffect := acts.map toClosedEffect

/-- **`execHandlerTurn`** — the registry executor. Run the closed effects (the `toClosedEffect` images)
all-or-nothing over the `.kernel` via the scaffold's `execTurn`, threading the receipt log. Any single
fail-closed handler aborts the whole turn (the `Option`-monad fold). -/

/-! ## §5 — THE DERIVED GLOBAL CONSERVATION (lift the scaffold's generic `turn_conserves`).

The combined per-asset measure over the kernel moves by the SUM of the per-effect deltas — PROVED by
LIFTING `Dregg2.Exec.Handler.turn_conserves` (generic over ANY `List ClosedEffect`) onto the chained
state's kernel. There is NO per-effect restatement and NO 56-arm cases matrix: the executable kernel
transition of `execHandlerTurn` IS `execTurn (closedOf acts)`, so the generic theorem applies VERBATIM.
THIS is the matrix-killer demonstrated at full scale. -/

/-- The combined per-asset turn delta of a `FullActionA` list under the handler executor: the SUM of the
per-effect deltas of the `toClosedEffect` images. (The right-hand budget conservation holds the measure
to — log-independent, a pure function of the closed-effect images.) -/

/-- **`execHandlerTurn_conserves` — THE DERIVED GLOBAL CONSERVATION (PROVED by LIFTING `turn_conserves`).**
For ANY `FullActionA` list run through the handler executor, the combined per-asset measure over the
kernel changes by EXACTLY the SUM of the per-effect deltas, at EVERY asset `b`. The proof is ONE LINE of
lifting: the kernel transition is `execTurn (closedOf acts)`, so the scaffold's generic `turn_conserves`
discharges it — NO per-arm matrix, NO re-derivation. The 56-arm `execFullA_ledger_per_asset` cases proof
collapses into this single lift. -/

/-! ## §6 — THE STRENGTHENING: `handler_refines_execFullA` (the relationship to the live executor).

The handler executor is a SOUND STRENGTHENING of `execFullA`: every effect the handler executor COMMITS,
`execFullA` ALSO commits, AND on the honest path they AGREE on the kernel. The handlers only ADD gates
(the `acceptsEffects` liveness wrap, the settle-actor `authorizedB` gate, …) — they never widen the set
of accepted transitions, and when they DO accept, the resulting kernel is EXACTLY what the bare chained
step would have produced. We prove it for the THREE hole-closing representatives (a transfer R1, an
escrow-release R2, a state-write R6); the rest are mechanical (`§DEFER`).

The bridge from the bare-kernel handler `step` to the chained `execHandlerOne`: a one-effect handler turn
runs `execTurn [toClosedEffect a]` which is exactly the handler's `step` on `s.kernel`. -/

/-- **The one-effect kernel-extraction.** A committed one-effect handler turn's resulting kernel is
EXACTLY the looked-up handler's `step` applied to the entry kernel. (`execTurn` over a singleton is the
handler `step`; the chained wrapper just threads the log.) -/

/-- **`handler_refines_execFullA_transfer` — THE R1 STRENGTHENING (PROVED).** Whenever the handler
executor commits a transfer, `execFullA` ALSO commits it AND produces the SAME kernel: `transferH`'s

/-! ### §6.3 — R6: STATE WRITE. The handler and `execFullA` now gate on the SAME predicates (RECONCILED).

R6 IS NOW CLOSED IN THE LIVE EXECUTOR. The bare `EffectsState.stateStep` gained a `cellLive`
(lifecycle-liveness) conjunct — so `execFullA`'s `.incrementNonceA`/`.setPermissionsA`/`.setVKA`/
`.refusalA`/`.receiptArchiveA` arms (and `.setFieldA` via `stateStepGuarded`) now REJECT a write into a
Sealed/Destroyed cell, exactly like `stateWriteH`'s `acceptsEffects` gate. `EffectsState.cellLive` is
DEFINITIONALLY `acceptsEffects` (both = `lifecycle cell == 0`/`lcLive`), so the two admission predicates
coincide. The handler still ADDITIONALLY requires `cell ∈ accounts` (membership) which the bare step
also checks; the strengthening is still stated on the honest path where the cell EXISTS, but the
liveness conjunct is now discharged DIRECTLY from the handler's `acceptsEffects` rather than carried as
an unproved gap. The authority conjunct is shared VERBATIM: `stateWriteH.auth = authorizedB caps
{actor,src:=cell,dst:=cell,amt:=0}` which is DEFINITIONALLY `EffectsState.stateAuthB caps actor cell`,
the gate `execFullA`'s `stateStep` checks. (The representative for the whole field-write/lifecycle
family — `setField`/`setPermissions`/`setVK`/`makeSovereign`/`refusal`/`receiptArchive`/`emit`/the
cell-lifecycle arms — which `toClosedEffect` routes through the SAME `stateWriteH`.) -/

/-- **`handler_refines_execFullA_stateWrite` — THE R6 STRENGTHENING (PROVED).**
On the honest path where the target cell EXISTS (`cell ∈ accounts`), whenever the handler executor
commits a nonce write, `execFullA` ALSO commits it AND produces the SAME kernel. With R6 reconciled,
`execFullA`'s bare `stateStep` now shares the handler's `acceptsEffects`/`cellLive` liveness gate
(definitionally), so the handler's liveness conjunct discharges the executor's; the shared authority
gate (`stateAuthB`) and the SAME `writeField nonceField` post-state make the kernels coincide. -/

`subTurn` produced (the circuit-layer `innerTurnH` pattern). -/

/-! ## §7 — THE TEETH: R1/R6 holes closed in BOTH executors (parity witnesses).

The payoff. For each hole, a single fixture exhibits the LIVE EXECUTOR `execFullA` accepting the attack
(`= some` — the hole) while the handler executor `execHandlerTurn` REJECTS it (`= none` — the algebra
closes it). `#eval`-verified below; this demonstrates the cutover STRICTLY improves soundness. -/

/-- A 2-cell, 1-asset chained fixture: cells 0 and 1 are accounts; cell 0 holds 100 of asset 0; cell 0
holds the `node 0`/`node 1` self+target authority (so the transfer / state-write self-authorizes). Cell 1
is SEALED (`lifecycle 1 = lcSealed`) — a NON-Live target. Cell 0 stays Live. -/

      { accounts := {0, 1}

-- §TEETH-R1 (TRANSFER INTO A SEALED CELL): R1 is now CLOSED IN THE LIVE EXECUTOR TOO. `recCexecAsset`

#guard ((execHandlerOne (.incrementNonceA 0 1 7) teethSealed).isSome) == false  --  false (CLOSED by acceptsEffects)

-- evaluated): a transfer 0→1 (30 of asset 0, both LIVE) + a self nonce-write on cell 0 leaves the

-- per-effect deltas is 0, exactly what `execHandlerTurn_conserves` proves).

        { kernel :=

/-! ## §8 — Axiom-hygiene pins (every cutover keystone rests only on the three kernel axioms).

The derived global laws + the strengthening + the executor structure are all pinned to the kernel triple
(`propext`/`Classical.choice`/`Quot.sound`). A `sorryAx` anywhere in the composed handlers — across all
seven batches the registry packs — would FAIL these pins (and the build). -/

/-! ## §DEFER — honest scope of THIS cutover keystone (additive; the call-site switch is mechanical).

Deliberately OUT of this file (documented, NOT a silent gap):

  * **The live-switch of callers.** This file is ADDITIVE: it does NOT edit `execFullA`/`FullActionA`.
    Switching `execFullA`'s 5 dregg1 call-sites onto `execHandlerTurn` (routing each `FullActionA` through
    `toClosedEffect`) is the next, MECHANICAL step — the algebra and its global laws are proved HERE so
    that switch is a rename, not a re-proof.

  * **The strengthening for the remaining constructors.** `handler_refines_execFullA_*` is now proved for
    transfer R1, release/refund R2, mint/burn/createEscrow/createCell supply, notes, bridge
    lock/finalize/cancel/pipelinedSend, state-write R6 (incrementNonce/setPermissions/setVK/refusal;
    `setField` under discharged `caveatsAdmit`), committed-escrow under `hidingProof = true`, the
    lifecycle family, authority (delegate/delegateAtten/introduce/validateHandoff/attenuate/revoke/
    dropRef/revokeDelegation), and seal/swiss. (F2b: the queue-family refinements died with the
    queue verbs — queue behavior is the factory story.)
    NOW CLOSED (§6.3b): `makeSovereignA` (handler ALIGNED to the `makeSovereignKernel`
    commitment-rebind — `hole_handler_makeSovereign`), `receiptArchiveA` (handler ALIGNED to the
    `"lifecycle"` field write — `hole_handler_receiptArchive`).
    REMAINING: `spawnA` / `createCellFromFactoryA` **full** `spawnChainA`/`createCellFromFactoryChainA`
    metadata (the born-empty `createCellA` core is now covered by
    `handler_refines_execFullA_{spawn,createCellFromFactory}`). For
    `exerciseA`, kernel agreement is on the **inner-turn honest path**
    (`handler_refines_execFullA_exercise` + `hinner`); the R4 facet-mask still narrows handler-commits.

  * **The state-write existence-predicate MISMATCH — RESOLVED (R6 closed in the live executor).** The
    bare `EffectsState.stateStep` now ALSO consults lifecycle-LIVENESS (`cellLive`, definitionally
    `acceptsEffects` = `lifecycle cell == 0`), so `execFullA`'s state-write arms reject a write into a
    Sealed/Destroyed cell exactly like `stateWriteH`. The admission predicates coincide; the handler
    additionally checks membership (`cell ∈ accounts`), which the bare step also checks, so the
    strengthening is still stated on the honest path where the cell exists — but the liveness conjunct is
    now PROVED through, not carried open. (`#eval §TEETH-R6`: `execFullA` now returns `none` on the
    Sealed-cell write, matching the handler.)

  * **The committed-escrow `hidingProof` projection.** `toClosedEffect` maps
    the committed escrow onto the plain escrow lock (the §8 Pedersen hiding portal is off the executable
    ledger). This is the documented executable core; the portal /
    receipt faces fold on at the cutover, unchanged in the conservation accounting.
