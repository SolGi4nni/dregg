# `Dregg2.Exec.SystemRootsBindingReduction` — the `system_roots` consensus binding, REBUILT as a
SECURITY REDUCTION on the grounded floor.

## What was here before, and why it was still a shirk

`Dregg2.Exec.SystemRoots` §3/§4 exports five bindings for the eight kernel-owned side-table roots
(escrow · queue · refcount · sturdyref · delegation · nullifier · commitments · sealed-boxes):

    systemRootsDigest_binds_or_collides           rootList sr = rootList sr' ∨ RootsColl …
    systemRootsDigest_binds_fn_or_collides        sr = sr'                   ∨ RootsColl …
    systemRootsDigest_binds_pointwise_or_collides (∀ i, sr i = sr' i)        ∨ RootsColl …
    cellCommitS_binds_systemRoots_or_collides     equal digest               ∨ CellCommitSColl …
    cellCommitS_binds_roots_pointwise_or_collides (∀ i, sr i = sr' i) ∨ CellCommitSColl ∨ RootsColl

Each was a genuine repair of a VACUOUS predecessor (they used to carry `compressNInjective`, which the
deployed BabyBear sponge REFUTES).  But they are still BARE DISJUNCTIONS, and at deployed parameters a
sponge collision EXISTS by pigeonhole — so `binds ∨ collides` is satisfiable through the `collides`
branch with `binds` never holding.  They quantify over SOLUTIONS.  Cryptographic hardness quantifies
over EFFICIENT ADVERSARIES.

⚑ **THESE ARE NOT THE HEADLINE ANY MORE.**  This module supplies the headline, and `SystemRoots`'s
docstrings now say so.  The exported security claim about the eight consensus roots is now
`sysRoots_binds_rom` / `cellCommitS_binds_rom` / `cellRoots_binds_rom` (§7): the same reductions on
the KEYED, QUERY-COUNTED random-oracle floor, which is PROVED (`KeyedRomFloor.keyedRom_hard`), with
no refutable hypothesis carried.  The `_from_polyTime` forms that used to sit here are DELETED — §6
proves their floor FALSE at the deployed sponge, and `Crypto.RomBindingReduction`'s header proves the
fixed-function game cannot be repaired by any `Eff`.

⚑ **AND THE DEMOTION IS NOT A DEPENDENCE — SAID PLAINLY, BECAUSE THE OPPOSITE IS THE EASY CLAIM.**
This reduction does NOT consume the five disjunctions.  Its win relation is
`EncodedBindingReduction.encBreakGame` at the deployed encoder, and the two bridges
(`sysRoots_forgery_is_break`, `cellCommitS_forgery_is_break`) are proved from `rootsEnc_faithful` +
`rootsEnc_inj` and from `List.append_cancel_left` respectively — the disjunctions appear over there
only in prose.  They survive for two reasons that are OPEN WORK, not architecture:

  1. `SystemRoots` §3′'s `_of_injective` strength bridges are derived from them, and
  2. they are STILL the exported headline one layer up — `Circuit.Emit.EffectVmFullStateRunnable`'s
     `wide_binds_systemRoots_or_collides` and its per-tag re-exports across 29 `Circuit/Emit`
     modules, of which exactly ONE (`EffectVmEmitMintRunnable`, via
     `EffectVmRowCommitReduction.wideRow_binds_from_polyTime`) has been re-pointed at a reduction.

Until (2) is finished, the deployed per-tag statements still offer the escape branch that this module
prices at the record layer.  That residual is named here rather than left for a reader to discover.

## The shape, and what it costs

The primitive is the deployed domain-separated Poseidon2 sponge
(`Poseidon2KeyedBridge.spongeFamily D`) — the real `List ℤ → ℤ` the prover computes, keyed by
the tag it absorbs.  The whole reduction is inherited from
`Dregg2.Crypto.EncodedBindingReduction`; this file supplies only

  * the two ENCODERS — `rootList` (the eight ordered root cells) at the digest layer, and
    `rest ++ [systemRootsDigest]` at the commitment layer — plus the definitional facts that the
    deployed digest/commitment ARE the family applied to them,
  * the STRUCTURAL injectivity `List.ofFn_inj` (a fact about the LIMB LAYOUT, not about the hash),
  * the fixed widths (`8` limbs at the digest layer, `rest.length + 1` at the commitment layer) that
    discharge the `poly_time` output-growth slot.

The three-way disjunction of `cellCommitS_binds_roots_pointwise_or_collides` becomes the standard
UNION BOUND (`EncodedBindingReduction.chained_binding_advantage_bound`): two extracted finders, two
advantages, one floor, one negligible sum.

⚑ **THE RESIDUAL, NAMED — AND THE INSTANTIATION IS PART OF IT.** The fixed-hash floor is
`HashCRHardQuant (spongeFamily D) Eff`, and at `Eff := ⊤` it is FALSE at deployed BabyBear parameters
(§5 — the honest price), at `Eff := ⊥` vacuous.  `Eff := IsPolyTime` is a strictly intermediate CLASS
(the class is proved inhabited, and `CostAdversary.bruteForce_not_polyTime` excludes the brute-force
PROGRAM) — but §6 PROVES that the floor AT that class is FALSE too at the deployed sponge:
`IsPolyTime` prices only ANSWER SIZE and declared syntactic work, so the `Classical.choice` adversary
that answers each tag with a TWO-LIMB collision is in it and wins with probability `1`
(`sysRoots_floor_polyTime_false_babyBear`).

So, stated without softening: at the FIXED hash, the `_advantage_bound` theorems (arbitrary `Eff`,
`hEff` in the open) are the honest content, and no `_from_polyTime` discharge survives — the three
that used to be exported here are DELETED, because their floor hypothesis is refuted by §6 and the
fixed-function game cannot be repaired by any class (`Crypto.RomBindingReduction`'s header: against a
fixed public sponge even a query-bounded adversary brute-forces).  The DISCHARGED headlines live in
§7, on the keyed-ROM floor, under the ROM idealisation named there — a floor that is PROVED
(`KeyedRomFloor.keyedRom_hard`, the birthday bound), at the price of a labelled modelling step
instead of a false hypothesis.

No `sorry`, no `axiom`, no `native_decide`.

/-! ## §1 — the two deployed ENCODERS, and the faithfulness facts. -/

/-- **THE DIGEST-LAYER ENCODER** — the eight ordered side-table roots, exactly the list the deployed
`systemRootsDigest` sponge absorbs.  Key-independent: the domain separation lives in the family's own
`H` (`sponge (tagCode t ++ ·)`), which is where the deployment puts it. -/
def rootsEnc (D : SpongeKeyed) :
    ∀ l, (spongeFamily D).Key l → SysRoots → (spongeFamily D).Input :=
  fun _ _ sr => rootList sr

/-- **THE COMMITMENT-LAYER ENCODER** — the canonical cell's absorbed list with the `system_roots`
digest folded in as its last limb.  Key-DEPENDENT, because the inner digest is itself computed at the
sampled tag: this is the deployed nesting, not an idealization. -/
def commitEnc (D : SpongeKeyed) (rest : List FieldElem) :
    ∀ l, (spongeFamily D).Key l → SysRoots → (spongeFamily D).Input :=
  fun _ t sr => rest ++ [systemRootsDigest (D.hashAt t) sr]

/-- **FAITHFULNESS (digest layer).** The deployed `systemRootsDigest` at the sampled tag IS the keyed
family applied to the encoder — a definitional equality, so the game below is a game about the very
function the prover computes. -/

/-- **FAITHFULNESS (commitment layer).** The deployed `cellCommitS` at the sampled tag IS the keyed
family applied to the commitment encoder. -/

/-- **THE STRUCTURAL INJECTIVITY — about the LIMB LAYOUT, never about the hash.** `rootList` is
`List.ofFn`, so equal root lists force the whole sub-block function equal.  This is the fact that makes
a sub-block equivocation an ENCODING equivocation, i.e. a genuine sponge break. -/

/-! ## §2 — the two forgery GAMES, and the deployed-object bridges.

`_binds_pointwise_or_collides` / `cellCommitS_binds_systemRoots_or_collides` as the exported claim.
All three digest-layer disjunctions are ONE game — they differed only in how the SAME binding was
projected (list / function / pointwise), which is precisely why three bare disjunctions were three
copies of one unpriced escape. -/

/-- **THE `system_roots` DIGEST FORGERY.** The adversary is handed a sampled domain-separation tag and
WINS iff it publishes ONE `systemRootsDigest` for TWO different side-table configurations — a dropped
escrow, an omitted nullifier, a reordered queue, all at once. -/

/-!  ⚑ **WHERE THE DISCHARGED HEADLINES WENT.** This section used to export
`sysRoots_binds_from_polyTime` / `cellCommitS_binds_from_polyTime`: the same reductions with `hEff`
discharged at `Eff := IsPolyTime`.  §6 PROVES that floor FALSE at the deployed sponge
(`sysRoots_floor_polyTime_false_babyBear`), so those exports were VACUOUS at deployed parameters, and
— `Crypto.RomBindingReduction`'s header argument — the fixed-function game they rest on cannot be
repaired by ANY `Eff`: against a fixed public sponge even a query-bounded adversary brute-forces.
They are DELETED.  The discharged headlines are now §7's `sysRoots_binds_rom` /
`cellCommitS_binds_rom` / `cellRoots_binds_rom`, on the keyed, query-counted random-oracle floor,
which is a THEOREM (`KeyedRomFloor.keyedRom_hard`).  The `_advantage_bound` forms above remain the
honest fixed-hash statements, with `hEff` in the open. -/

`cellCommitS_binds_roots_pointwise_or_collides` exported a THREE-way bare disjunction — TWO escape
branches.  Here it is one game with two extractors and one floor: the standard union bound. -/

/-- **THE FULL-CHAIN FORGERY.** The adversary WINS iff two cells with the SAME canonical commitment
(over the same `rest`) disagree on ANY of the eight side-table roots.  This is the deployed soundness
statement for the whole `system_roots` sub-block: "the canonical commitment binds the whole side-table
state". -/

advantages, one floor, one negligible sum — the union bound, not an escape hatch.

/-! ## §6 — ⚑ THE INSTANTIATED FLOOR IS FALSE TOO, AT THE DEPLOYED SPONGE.

§5 prices the ⊤ pole and records that `Eff := IsPolyTime` sits STRICTLY BETWEEN the two poles AS A
CLASS.  That is true and it is not enough, and this section says why in Lean rather than in prose.

`CostAdversary.IsPolyTime sz A` is `∃ B : CostAdversary …, B.toAdversary = A ∧ PolyTime sz B`, and
`CostAdversary.idAdv a₀` accepts an ARBITRARY Lean function `a₀` — including a `Classical.choice` one —
as `.pure (a₀ l i)`, whose whole cost is `sz l (a₀ l i)`.  So the class contains EVERY adversary whose
ANSWERS are poly-size, no matter how hard those answers are to find:
`isPolyTime_of_polySize_answers` below is that observation, proved.

Consequently the floor at `Eff := IsPolyTime` is not the class restriction it reads as.  A compressing
sponge has SHORT collisions — the one-limb messages `[n]`, `n : ℤ`, are an infinite family landing in
one bounded field — so the choice adversary that answers with a short collision at every tag is in the
class, wins with probability `1`, and REFUTES the floor.  `sysRoots_floor_polyTime_false_babyBear` is
that refutation at the deployed BabyBear bound.

⚑ **WHAT THIS MEANT FOR THE OLD HEADLINES — AND WHAT WAS DONE ABOUT IT.**
`sysRoots_binds_from_polyTime`, `cellCommitS_binds_from_polyTime` and `cellRoots_binds_from_polyTime`
carried `HashCRHardQuant (spongeFamily D) (IsPolyTime (spongeAnsSize D))` as a hypothesis, and at the
deployed sponge that hypothesis is FALSE — the same defect, one level up, as the `compressNInjective`
bindings this whole repair deleted.  They are now DELETED in turn, and their successors are §7's
`_binds_rom` forms.  The `_advantage_bound` forms are NOT vacuous and remain: they quantify over an
arbitrary class with `hEff` in the open, and they are the honest fixed-hash content of this module.

⚑ **THE DEFECT WAS THE COST MODEL AND THE GAME, NOT THIS SITE.** `IsPolyTime` measures OUTPUT SIZE
plus DECLARED syntactic work, and lets any Lean function be embedded at that price, so it cannot
separate "writes a short string" from "finds a collision" — and no repair of the class fixes the
GAME, because the fixed public sponge can be brute-forced by any adversary allowed to evaluate it
(`Crypto.RomBindingReduction`'s header).  The fix that landed is the one that works: the floor moved
to a SAMPLED oracle (`Crypto.KeyedRomFloor`), where query-counting has teeth and the birthday bound
is a THEOREM.  This section survives as the refutation that FORCED that move, provable at a deployed
instance. -/

/-! ## §7 — ⚑⚑ THE KEYED-ROM RE-GROUNDING: the discharged headlines, on a floor that is PROVED.

§6 killed the `IsPolyTime` discharge, and `Crypto.RomBindingReduction`'s header proves the deeper
point: NO efficiency class repairs the fixed-function game, because the sponge there is a fixed
public function and only the tag is sampled.  The floor must move to a SAMPLED oracle.  This section
is that move for the eight consensus roots, on `Crypto.RomCarrierSites`' kit.

⚑ **THE MODELLING STEP, STATED (not smuggled).**  Landing here idealises the deployed
domain-separated Poseidon2 sponge as a keyed RANDOM ORACLE at an ASYMPTOTIC digest width:

  * the sampled `H : Tag × Msg → Fin (2 ^ l)` replaces the fixed public
    `sponge (tagCode t ++ ·)` — the standard ROM idealisation, a deliberate modelling step and NOT a
    derivation (`DomainSeparatedCREffRegrounded` §5's rule);
  * the digest space `Fin (2 ^ l)` is `λ`-growing where the deployed felt is a FIXED ~31-bit
    BabyBear element — there is no `l` at which they coincide, and at the deployed width the honest
    reading stays "binds exactly as well as ~31 bits allow" (birthday ≈ `2^15.5`), the felt-width
    wound (`docs/WOUND-felt-width-boundaries-2026-07-19.md`);
  * the message domain is the TRUNCATED deployed shape: sub-blocks of BabyBear-RANGE roots
    (`RootsBlock`), and `rest` limbs of fixed width `m`.  On everything the deployed prover actually
    absorbs (in-range felts, fixed layout) the truncation is LOSSLESS — `truncRoots_inj` and
    `truncRoots_rootList` pin that limb-for-limb;
  * the chained commitment absorbs the inner digest as a `Fin (2 ^ l)` limb (`Sum.inr (rest, dig)`),
    modelling the deployed `rest ++ [systemRootsDigest]` absorb; at the ideal width that limb is not
    a felt — the SAME felt-width residual, carried visibly in the type.

What the move buys: the floor under every theorem below is `KeyedRomFloor.keyedRom_hard` — the
birthday bound, a THEOREM with no assumption under it — where the deleted `_from_polyTime` forms
carried a hypothesis §6 REFUTES.  What it does not buy: any statement about the fixed deployed sponge
itself.

The two message shapes are domain-separated by the `Sum` constructor inside ONE family, so both
layers share one sampled oracle and the chain is a genuine union bound over it. -/
