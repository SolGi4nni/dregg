# Dregg2.Exec.TurnExecutorFull — WIDENING the replacement executor to the FULL dregg1 op-set.

`Exec/TurnExecutor.lean`'s `execTurn` runs dregg1's call-forest of catalog-typed *balance/effect*
`Action`s as an all-or-nothing transaction, step-complete by construction (`execTurn_attests`: the
four `StepInv` conjuncts over the whole multi-`Action` turn). But dregg1's turn-executor does MORE
than balance/effect moves: it also runs **authority ops** (grant/revoke caps — the Granovetter
delegate / target-revoke) and **supply ops** (mint/burn — the only ops that legitimately move the
conserved total). For the replacement to SUBSUME every dregg1 turn kind, it must cover those too.

This module widens the executor. We introduce a single sum

  `FullAction = balance (a `TurnExecutor.Action`)
              | delegate / revoke  (an AUTHORITY turn, via `AuthTurn`'s `recKDelegate` /
                                    `recKRevokeTarget`)
              | mint / burn        (a SUPPLY turn, the record-cell refinement of
                                    `Generators.execMint` / `execBurn` over the `balance` FIELD)`

and one executor `execFull : RecChainedState → FullAction → Option RecChainedState`, all over the
SAME content-addressed record world (`RecChainedState` / `recTotal` / `balOf`) that `TurnExecutor`
and `AuthTurn` already share — so the widening is ONE executor, not three. Each kind is
all-or-nothing (fail-closed gates, `Option`-monad). A whole turn is a list of `FullAction`s run as
a transaction (`execFullTurn`), exactly `execTurn`'s discipline lifted to the wider op-set.

We then PROVE that EVERY kind attests its `StepInv` obligations, packaged as `fullActionInv`:

  * **balance/effect** — Conservation (the `balance` field) ∧ Authority ∧ ChainLink ∧ ObsAdvance,
    delegated VERBATIM to `recCexec_attests` (the `TurnExecutor` spine, one op);
  * **authority (delegate/revoke)** — the FRAME-FIX: `recTotal` is UNCHANGED (conservation trivially
    preserved — `recKDelegate_frame` / `recKRevokeTarget_frame`), and the cap graph is EDITED per
    `AuthTurn` (`recKDelegate_execGraph` / `recKRevokeTarget_execGraph` = `Spec.addEdge`/`removeEdge`
    = `Introduce`/`Revoke` `result`); a delegation is moreover AUTHORIZED (`recKDelegate_grounds`:
    the delegator holds the source edge — "only connectivity begets connectivity");
  * **mint/burn** — the supply MOVES by exactly `±amt` (`recMint_delta` / `recBurn_delta`, the
    record-cell refinement of `Generators.mint_delta`/`burn_delta`) with the
    Generative/Annihilative DISCLOSURE obligation discharged off `CatalogEffects`
    (`g_bridgeMint`/`a_bridgeFinalize` color ⇒ `is_disclosed_non_conservation`), and mint/burn are AUTHORIZED
    (the privileged `mintAuthorizedB` gate — a cell cannot coin its own supply).

The headline `execFull_attests` bundles these per-kind: every committed `FullAction` attests the
relevant `StepInv` content for its kind, so the replacement executor is **step-complete across EVERY
dregg1 turn kind** — not just balance/effect. (`fullActionInv` is never weakened: each kind carries
exactly its sound obligations, with conservation tracked EXACTLY — `0` for balance/authority, `±amt`
for mint/burn — via the `ledgerDelta` book-keeping, the executable shadow of dregg1's per-domain
`excess`.)

**W1 (DREGG3 §2.2 — the value unification), LANDED ON THE PER-ASSET LAYER.** The narration above
describes the SCALAR `FullAction` spine (kept as the heritage layer, `±amt` disclosure intact).
The LIVE per-asset layer (`FullActionA`/`execFullA`, §MA below) is post-W1: `AssetId := CellId`
(the asset IS its issuer cell), `recKMintAsset`/`recKBurnAsset` are ISSUER-MOVES (mint = the
issuer's negative-capable well → recipient; burn = holder → well; authority over the ISSUER, E2),
`bridgeMintA` is the BRIDGE-issuer move, and the per-asset delta family vanishes identically
(`ledgerDeltaAsset_eq_zero`) — every committed action/transaction/forest conserves EVERY asset
EXACTLY (`execFullA_conserves_exact`/`execFullTurnA_conserves_exact`), making `∀ a, Σ_c bal c a = 0`
a reachability invariant (`Exec/ReachableConservation.lean`). The pre-W1 supply-increment laws
survive only as `recKMintAssetLegacy`/`recKBurnAssetLegacy` — the non-vacuity teeth
(`Exec/IssuerMove.lean`).

Pure, computable, `#eval`-able. Reuses `TurnExecutor`/`AuthTurn`/`Generators`/
`CatalogEffects`/`RecordKernel`; edits none. Verified standalone:

/-! ## §1 — Record-cell MINT/BURN: the supply generators over the `balance` FIELD.

`Exec/Generators.lean` proves `execMint`/`execBurn` over the *scalar* `KernelState` (`bal : CellId →
ℤ`, measure `total`). The full executor lives in the *record* world (`RecordKernelState`, measure
`recTotal` over the `balance` field). So we re-found the two supply generators here over the record
cell — the EXACT analog of `Generators` but writing the named `balance` field via `setBalance` —
reusing `Generators.mintAuthorizedB` (the privileged `node`/`control` gate; bare ownership is NOT
enough to coin supply) and `Kernel.sum_indicator` (the single-point-sum technique). -/

/-- Credit cell `cell`'s `balance` field by `amt` (record-cell mint write). Touches only `cell`'s
record (and only its `balance` field — every other field of the content-addressed record survives,
by `setBalance`); every other cell is untouched. -/

/-- **Executable record-cell burn.** Fail-closed: debits `cell`'s `balance` field by `amt` only when
authorized, the amount is non-negative and available (`amt ≤ balOf (cell)`), and `cell` is live. The

/-! ## §2 — The DISCLOSURE obligation for the SCALAR HERITAGE supply ops.

⚠ **WHICH MECHANISM THIS SECTION IS ABOUT.** `recKMint`/`recKBurn` above are the pre-W1 SCALAR
laws: one-sided credit/debit of a single cell's `balance` field, with `recTotal` moving by exactly
`±amt` (`recKMint_delta`/`recKBurn_delta`). That really IS a non-conservation, and it really must
disclose its delta — so the obligation below is sound. What it is NOT is `Effect::Burn`.

The LIVE per-asset layer (§MA, `recKBurnAsset`/`recKMintAsset`) is post-W1: both are ISSUER-MOVES
against the asset's negative-capable well, `Exec/IssuerMove.lean` proves
`issuerBurnK_preserves_exact`/`issuerMoveK_preserves_exact`, and the one-sided laws survive only as
`recKBurnAssetLegacy`/`recKMintAssetLegacy` — the non-vacuity teeth that PROVABLY BREAK
`ExactConservation`. Accordingly `CatalogInstances` colors `EffectKind.burn`/`.mint`
**`Conservative`** (recolored 2026-07-28; `burn_not_annihilative` states the old color is false).

So the catalog kinds this section names are the CROSS-CHAIN FLOWS, whose shape genuinely matches
the scalar heritage op: value appears (or leaves) with no local sibling delta. `mintEffect` already
pointed at `.bridgeMint` rather than a mint kind for exactly this reason; `burnEffect` now points
at its dual instead of misnaming the conserving local verb.
-/

/-- The catalog effect kind whose color the SCALAR heritage `recKMint` carries: `.bridgeMint`, the
disclosed cross-chain INFLOW (Generative). NOT `EffectKind.mint`, which is the conserving
well→holder issuer-move. -/
def mintEffect : EffectKind := .bridgeMint

/-- The catalog effect kind whose color the SCALAR heritage `recKBurn` carries: `.bridgeFinalize`,
the disclosed cross-chain OUTFLOW (Annihilative). NOT `EffectKind.burn`, which is the conserving
holder→well issuer-move (`burn_conservative`). -/
def burnEffect : EffectKind := .bridgeFinalize

/-- **Mint discloses.** The mint effect is Generative, hence carries the disclosed
non-conservation obligation: its supply delta must be revealed in the receipt. Discharged off
`CatalogEffects.generative_discloses` + `g_bridgeMint`. -/
theorem mint_discloses : (effectLinearity mintEffect).is_disclosed_non_conservation = true :=
  Dregg2.CatalogEffects.generative_discloses mintEffect Dregg2.CatalogEffects.g_bridgeMint

/-- **The heritage burn discloses.** Its catalog color is Annihilative, hence disclosed: the
removed amount must be revealed. Discharged off `CatalogEffects.annihilative_discloses` +
`a_bridgeFinalize`. -/
theorem burn_discloses : (effectLinearity burnEffect).is_disclosed_non_conservation = true :=
  Dregg2.CatalogEffects.annihilative_discloses burnEffect Dregg2.CatalogEffects.a_bridgeFinalize

/-- **ANTI-VACUITY / the other pole.** The disclosure obligation above is not a property every
catalog kind has: the LIVE supply verbs `EffectKind.burn`/`.mint` — the ones the per-asset layer
runs — come out `false` for the very same predicate, because they conserve. Without this the
`_discloses` pair could be read as "the classifier is constant". -/
theorem live_supply_does_not_disclose :
    (effectLinearity EffectKind.burn).is_disclosed_non_conservation = false ∧
    (effectLinearity EffectKind.mint).is_disclosed_non_conservation = false ∧
    (effectLinearity EffectKind.burn).requires_paired_sibling = true ∧
    (effectLinearity EffectKind.mint).requires_paired_sibling = true :=
  ⟨rfl, rfl, rfl, rfl⟩

/-- The SCALAR HERITAGE mint/burn carry the `Disclosed` regime (NOT `Paired`): the one-sided laws
break conservation, with the delta disclosed. ⚠ This is a statement about `recKMint`/`recKBurn`,
NOT about `Effect::Mint`/`Effect::Burn` — the live per-asset issuer-moves are `Regime.Paired`
(`effectObligation EffectKind.burn = Regime.Paired`). PROVED. -/
theorem mint_regime_disclosed : effectObligation mintEffect = Regime.Disclosed := rfl
theorem burn_regime_disclosed : effectObligation burnEffect = Regime.Disclosed := rfl

/-! ## §3 — Authority turns lifted to `RecChainedState` (the chained delegate / revoke).

`AuthTurn`'s `recKDelegate`/`recKRevokeTarget` edit `RecordKernelState.caps`. To run them inside the
unified chained executor we lift each onto `RecChainedState`, threading the receipt chain exactly as
`recCexec` does (newest move first), but carrying an authority "move" marker rather than a balance
`Turn`. The conserved measure is FIXED across an authority turn (the dual frame). -/

/-- A synthetic receipt marker for an authority turn (a self-`Turn` on the actor, amount `0`), so the
authority edit lands a row on the SAME receipt chain (`List Turn`) as balance/supply ops. It carries
no balance delta (`amt := 0`) — the chain entry records THAT an authority edit happened, while the
graph change itself is proven separately (`AuthTurn`'s `execGraph` match). -/
def authReceipt (actor : CellId) : Turn := { actor := actor, src := actor, dst := actor, amt := 0 }

/-- **Chained delegate.** Run `recKDelegate`; on commit, append an authority receipt. -/

    Option RecChainedState :=
  match recKDelegate s.kernel delegator recipient t with

  | none    => none

/-- **Chained RIGHTS-CARRYING delegate.** Run `recKDelegateAtten` (the faithful `apply_introduce`:
gate on the delegator holding a cap to `t`, then grant `recipient` the delegator's held cap to `t`
ATTENUATED to `keep` — REAL rights `⊆` held, `recKDelegateAtten_non_amplifying`, stricter than the
unattenuated held-cap copy of `recKDelegate`); on commit, append an authority receipt. Balance-NEUTRAL: edits
ONLY `caps` (`recKDelegateAtten_frame`), so `ledgerDeltaAsset = 0` for every asset. -/

    Option RecChainedState :=
  match recKDelegateAtten s.kernel delegator recipient t keep with
  | some k' => some { kernel := k', log := authReceipt delegator :: s.log }
  | none    => none

/-- **Chained revoke.** `recKRevokeTarget` always commits (revocation only subtracts authority);
append an authority receipt. -/
def recCRevoke (s : RecChainedState) (holder t : CellId) : RecChainedState :=
  { kernel := recKRevokeTarget s.kernel holder t, log := authReceipt holder :: s.log }

/-- **Chained FULL delegation-revoke.** The committed form of `recKRevokeDelegationFull` (`AuthTurn.lean`):
the shared cap-edge `removeEdge` (leg 1) COMPOSED with the epoch bump + child-snapshot clear (legs 2+3 —
the dregg1 `apply_revoke_delegation` extras: bump the PARENT's `delegationEpoch`, clear the CHILD's
`delegations` snapshot + reset its `delegationEpochAt` stamp). Like `recCRevoke`, always commits
(revocation only subtracts authority) and appends one authority receipt. This is the FAITHFUL chained
step for the `.revokeDelegationA` arm — staling the revoked child's snapshot, not merely dropping the
cap edge. -/

  match recKMint s.kernel actor cell amt with
  | some k' => some { kernel := k', log := { actor := actor, src := cell, dst := cell, amt := amt } :: s.log }
  | none    => none

/-- **Chained burn.** Run `recKBurn`; on commit, append a supply receipt carrying `-amt`. -/
def recCBurn (s : RecChainedState) (actor cell : CellId) (amt : ℤ) : Option RecChainedState :=

/-! ## §4 — `FullAction` and `execFull`: ONE executor over the FULL op-set. -/

/-- **The FULL dregg1 op-set, as one sum.** A single `FullAction` is one of:
  * `balance a` — a catalog-typed balance/effect `Action` (dregg1's `Action`; runs via `recCexec`);
  * `delegate delegator recipient t` — a Granovetter authority grant (runs via `recKDelegate`);
  * `revoke holder t` — a target revocation (runs via `recKRevokeTarget`);
  * `mint actor cell amt` / `burn actor cell amt` — the privileged supply generators.
This widens `TurnExecutor.Action` (balance/effect only) to subsume EVERY dregg1 turn kind. -/

/-- **The ledger delta of a `FullAction`** — its exact effect on the conserved `recTotal`. Balance,

The unified conservation law (the record-world analog of `Unified.step_delta`): balance and
authority kinds are conservation-trivial (`0`); mint/burn move the supply by exactly `±amt`. Proved
by `cases` over the kinds, reusing each primitive's already-proven delta fact. -/

re-append, and is detectable. -/

its kind. Conservation is tracked EXACTLY (`ledgerDelta`); ChainLink + ObsAdvance hold for ALL kinds;
the authority/disclosure obligations are carried per kind. `fullActionInv` is never weakened — each
kind carries its full, sound obligations (the supply kinds correctly DISCLOSE rather than conserve,
the asymmetry dregg1's catalog forces). -/

  * **ObsAdvance** — the chain grew by exactly one row (replay-detectable);
  * **KindObligation** — the kind-specific integrity content: balance ⇒ `authorizedB`; delegate ⇒

    mint/burn ⇒ `mintAuthorizedB` AND the Generative/Annihilative `is_disclosed_non_conservation`. -/
