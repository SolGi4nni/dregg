# AutomataflFFI — the wire-oracle teeth EVALUATION, out of the crypto archive's build

`AutomataflFFI.lean` sits in the `Dregg2.FFI` closure (the crypto archive's build root), and
until 2026-08-08 its §5 teeth ran 52 `#guard` wire pins at elaboration — so any game-fixture
regression was a hard failure of every Rust proving target in the workspace. The witness boards
(`demoBoard`, `cycBoard`, `blockBoard`) remain in `AutomataflFFI.lean`; THIS module is where the
pins are RUN — each former `#guard` as a NAMED theorem per GUARD-DISCIPLINE, proved by
`native_decide` and pinned `#assert_compiled`. Rooted in the central guard library and reachable
from `Dregg2.FFI` by NOTHING, so a plain `lake build` still evaluates every pin while
`lake build Dregg2.FFI` never does. Every pinned expression mentions only PUBLIC names, so the
expressions moved verbatim; the section narratives moved with them.

/-- The LEGAL TARGETS of (0,0) on the 5x5 board: the rest of row 0 and the rest of column 0 —
the rook line, minus the source itself. (0,1) holds a repulsor and stays legal to NAME:

/-! ### `livetargets` — the destinations that would EXECUTE

⚑ These are the teeth for the wound `targets_verb_is_the_rook_line` DOCUMENTS: `targets` from
`(0,0)` on `cycBoard` includes `(0,1)` — where a repulsor stands — and `(0,2)`/`(0,3)`/`(0,4)`
BEHIND it, and it is right to, because naming an occupied square is a legal proposal. A surface
reading that set as "squares you can move to" lights straight through the blocker, which is what
`dregg-automatafl/src/surface.rs` painted until this verb existed. -/

/-- The same source, the same board, the EXECUTABLE half: the empty row-0 rook line only. The
four column-0 squares are gone — `(0,1)` is the repulsor's own square (a destination-inclusive
block) and `(0,2)`/`(0,3)`/`(0,4)` sit behind it. -/

/-- ⚑ CONDITIONAL, NOT ABSOLUTE. Hand the SAME question the fact that seat 1 is moving the
repulsor off `(0,1)`: a mover's source is PASSABLE, so all eight proposable squares become
live — including `(0,1)` itself, which empties. The two sets COINCIDE here, which is exactly
why the surface may not treat "blocked" as "illegal". -/
theorem livetargets_with_public_mover_coincides_with_targets :

/-! ### ⚑ THE SHIPPED BOARD, AND THE EXACT SQUARES A PLAYER WAS LIED TO ABOUT

ember selected the stock opening's attractor at `⟨3,1⟩` on the live 11×11 table and the surface
lit `⟨3,10⟩` — the far end of the file, BEHIND the attractor standing on `⟨3,9⟩` — plus the
whole of row 1 behind the three repulsors at `⟨4,1⟩`/`⟨5,1⟩`/`⟨6,1⟩`. Nine of the twenty
painted squares could not have executed. Both polarities are pinned so neither half can regress
into the other. -/

theorem round_verb_resolves_clean_round :

/-! ### `adjudicate` — the capped match's terminal rule

The stock opening is a GENUINE draw, not an accident of the encoding: the automaton starts at
`⟨5,5⟩`, seat 0 owns the `y = 0` corners and seat 1 the `y = 10` corners, so on an 11×11 both
seats sit exactly 5 away. The two direct pins below are the anti-vacuity poles — nudge the
automaton one row and the adjudication actually picks a winner, so `-1` above is a verdict
rather than a stuck default. -/

theorem adjudicate_truncated_fails_closed :
    (rulesFFI "adjudicate 5" == "0") = true := by native_decide

/-! ### `dist` — the two numbers behind the verdict

The played surface shows a THREAT reading per seat ("N steps from a goal"). These pins tie it
to `goalDistance`, so the number on screen is the one `adjudicateCapped` actually compares and
the one `adjudicate_sound` is a theorem about.

Non-vacuity is the point of the three poles: the stock opening is 10/10 with a `-1` verdict (a
dead heat, matching `stock_opening_adjudicates_draw`), and the two nudged boards report
DIFFERENT numbers with a decisive verdict — so a reader can see that the pair moves, and moves
together. `⟨10,2⟩` is the position the play harness actually froze on
(`adjudicate_decisive_witness`): 2 from seat 0's `⟨10,0⟩`, 8 from seat 1's `⟨10,10⟩`. -/
