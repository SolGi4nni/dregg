# AutomataflRules — the conformance-block EVALUATION, out of the crypto archive's build

`AutomataflRules.lean` sits in the `Dregg2.FFI` closure (the crypto archive's build root), and
until 2026-08-08 its §10 conformance block ran 110 `#guard` fixture pins at elaboration — so any
game-fixture regression was a hard failure of every Rust proving target in the workspace (the
compilation-unit coupling the stale-fixture outage measured). The WITNESS BOARDS and moves
remain in `AutomataflRules.lean`; THIS module is where the facts are RUN — each former `#guard`
as a NAMED theorem per GUARD-DISCIPLINE (a fact worth asserting is worth naming), proved by
`native_decide` and pinned `#assert_compiled`. It is rooted in the central guard library and
reachable from `Dregg2.FFI` by NOTHING, so:

  * a plain `lake build` still evaluates every pin — no loss of checking;
  * `lake build Dregg2.FFI` (what `dregg-lean-ffi/build.rs` and the seed scripts run) never
    does — a red pin here can no longer take the archive down.

Facts that mention the parent's private helpers (`mv`, `cfgCol`/`cfgRow`/`cfgFrz`, `noGoals`)
are pinned through the public evaluation-free `check_* : Bool` definitions the parent exposes.
Sections mirror the parent's §10, keyed to the audit's divergence table
(`docs/reference/AUTOMATAFL-RULES-CONFORMANCE-AUDIT.md` §A).
