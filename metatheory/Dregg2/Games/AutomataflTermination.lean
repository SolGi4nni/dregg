# AutomataflTermination — M3 of the multi-round conflict braid: THE TERMINATION BOUND

⚑ SUBSTRATE. This file is **pure spec-side Lean**: it reasons about
`Dregg2.Games.AutomataflRules.roundStep` / `runTurn` and nothing else. It authors **no AIR, no
gadget, no constraint** — the Leg C descriptor (M1/M2) is Lean-authored AIR living under
`Dregg2.Circuit.Emit.Automatafl*`, and this file is the SPEC-side half its refinement theorem
will be pushed through. Nothing here is Rust and nothing here should become Rust.

## What this closes (design doc §5, `docs/reference/AUTOMATAFL-MULTIROUND-BRAID-DESIGN.md`)

The conflict re-entry protocol RECURSES: a clash marks the conflicted coordinate(s), the
conflicted seats re-enter, repeat until clean. For the braid fold (M7) to be a fixed-depth
verifiable object, the recursion needs a **bound**. The argument:

1. **marks strictly grows on every clash round.** `roundStep`'s `.again` branch sets
   `marks := (marks ++ cs).dedup` with `cs ≠ []`, and `cs ∩ marks = ∅` because
   * `cs ⊆ candidates all` — the conflicted coordinates are move ENDPOINTS. For the
     fork/collide clash this is immediate (`clashCoords` filters `candidates`); for the
     MERGE/confluence clash it is `unresolved_subset_candidates` below, which is the real
     content: a contested LANDING square is reached by walking `edgeMap` edges, and every
     edge's head is some move's `.to` (`stopWalk_mem`). So the merge case is **PROVEN, not
     scoped**.
   * every move in `all = locked ++ fresh` is `marks`-legal — `fresh` by `roundStep`'s own
     `moveLegalB rs.board rs.marks` filter, `locked` by the `RoundWF` invariant, which
     `roundStep` re-establishes because it DROPS every locked move a new mark touches.
2. **marks ⊆ the `n²` board coordinates**, since every mark is an endpoint of a legal (hence
   in-bounds) move. So `|marks| ≤ n²`.
3. Hence a turn takes at most `n² − |marks|` clash rounds (`againDepth_le`), and `runTurn`
   fed a trace of length `> n²` ALWAYS reaches a `.resolved` outcome (`runTurn_fuel_bound`).

**There is no stuck state.** `runTurn` returns `none` for exactly one reason: the submission
trace ran out while the turn was still awaiting re-entry. `roundStep` is total and always
returns `.again` or `.resolved` — even a round in which every submission is illegal is not
stuck, it is CLEAN (`fresh = []`, `all = locked`), and a round with no moves at all resolves
trivially (`clashCoords [] = []`, `unresolved [] = []`). So "out of fuel" is a statement about
the TRACE the prover supplies, never about the game wedging.

## What M7 (the braid fold) consumes

```lean
theorem againDepth_le (cfg : GameConfig) (g : GoalAssignment) (rs : RoundState)
    (trace : List (List Move)) (hwf : RoundWF rs) :
    againDepth cfg g rs trace + rs.marks.length ≤ rs.board.size * rs.board.size
```

— the number of Leg C leaves in a turn's braid, bounded by `n²` (121 at n=11), with the
`openRound` corollary `againDepth_le_openRound : againDepth … ≤ b.size * b.size`.

/-! ### ⚑ MUTATION CANARY — `RoundWF` is LOAD-BEARING, not decoration

Drop the invariant (hand the round a LOCKED move whose endpoint is ALREADY marked — exactly
what `roundStep` prevents by dropping newly-conflicted locked moves) and the conclusion of
`roundStep_marks_strict_growth` becomes FALSE: the round still re-enters, but `cs` is a
coordinate that was already in `marks`, so `(marks ++ cs).dedup` has the SAME length and the
measure `n² − |marks|` does not descend. -/

  { board := d5Board, marks := [⟨0, 0⟩], locked := [d5A, d5B], waiting := [] }
