# Dregg2.Games.DungeonCompleteness — uniform capability and completeness laws.

This file closes two named seams between the native Lean model (`Dungeon`) and its
Lean-authored `Exec.RecordProgram` model (`DungeonProgram`):

* the key-exhibition inversion is uniform over every deployed keyed way (2, 3, 4),
  rather than a theorem specialized to way 2;
* the exact boundary of honest model-to-program completeness is formalized: the
  coarse `Inv` is insufficient, while every actually replay-reachable state
  preserves the stronger per-relic provenance relation the program requires.

⚑ **REBUILT AGAINST `custodyHops`, NOT `custody_ratchet`.** The model retired
`Dungeon.custody_ratchet` AS FALSE: `unlock` now hangs the key in the door it opened
(`CARRIED → HUNG + depth`) and `take` lifts it back out (`HUNG + depth → CARRIED`), so
custody codes go up and then DOWN and no monotonicity survives. This file used to lean on
that retired predicate in exactly one place (`custody_getD_mono`, feeding the deployed
`.monotonic` custody atom). Both are gone. What replaces them is strictly more
informative and matches the deployed teeth one-for-one:

* `custody_hop_of_step` — every legal step moves every relic along one of the hops the
  deployed `allowedTransitions (relic_i) (custodyHops i)` tooth enumerates: `stay`,
  `(home, CARRIED)` (loot), `(CARRIED, BANKED)` (flee), and — keys only —
  `(CARRIED, HUNG + d)` (unlock) and `(HUNG + d, CARRIED)` (take). The hop enumeration is
  what closed a real hole: `monotonic ∧ memberOf {home, CARRIED, BANKED}` ADMITTED
  `home → BANKED`, a relic teleporting out of a hoard straight into the bank without ever
  passing through the pack and therefore never paying the capacity commons. That
  transition is in no arm of `Dungeon.step`, and it is in no hop of `custodyHops`.
* `CustodyHomeWF` — widened from three codes to the deployed `custodyAlphabet`: a KEY
  relic may additionally hang in any door (`HUNG + 1 … HUNG + FLOORS`); the prize and the
  treasures may not, because `unlock` writes slot `keyFor w = w − 1` with `2 ≤ w` and
  nothing else ever writes a `HUNG` code.
* the zone partition is TEN-wide (`pack`, `bank`, four hoards, four doors), because a key
  hanging in a door is in none of the other six and `Σ zones = RELICS` is otherwise FALSE
  on every turn after the first `unlock`.

Honest scope: every theorem here is about the name-keyed, signed-`Int`
`Exec.RecordProgram` model.  It does not claim refinement to the deployed unsigned
evaluator; `DungeonProgram.lean` records that separate substrate seam.

⚑ **THE EXHIBIT MOVED TO THE PRE-STATE, AND SO DOES THIS REFUSAL.** It used to demand
`n.relic ≠ CARRIED` — the POST-state read. That is now FALSE of the rulebook: a lawful
`unlock` leaves the key HANGING (`HUNG + depth`), so the old statement would have said
every legal way-flip is refused, which is the "a tooth that refuses everything" failure
mode. The honest form is the one `way_flip_exhibits_key` actually proves: the capability
had to be OWNED GOING IN. That is strictly stronger than the old reading ever was — an
attacker who acquires the key ON the flipping turn satisfied the post-state form and does
not satisfy this one. -/

/-- ⚑ **THE PARTITION IS TEN-WIDE.** A relic is in the pack, in the bank, lying in one of
the four hoards, or HANGING IN ONE OF THE FOUR DOORS — and the ten counters are exactly a
partition of the custody list, so `Σ zones = RELICS` is an identity rather than a hope.
The door family is not optional bookkeeping: after the first `unlock` a key is in none of
the other six zones (it left the pack, and `fleeMap` promotes `CARRIED` and only
`CARRIED`, so it never reaches the bank), and the six-zone sum this used to state is
simply FALSE from that turn on. -/

That last clause is what the counter-side door frame could never say and is why the frame
moved onto the object: `unlock` hangs the key in the door of `s.depth` and `take` lifts one
out of the door of `s.depth`, on a turn that does not move `depth` at all. So a key can
neither enter nor leave a door on a floor the run is not standing at — which is exactly
the two `heapField` teeth `doorArrivalTooth` / `doorDepartureTooth` demand, and exactly the

/-! ### The LUNGE — the second blow, and the only verb that may move `harm`.

`lunge` is `smite`'s twin everywhere except the two registers that are the whole design:
it pays `1` breath instead of `2`, and it writes `harm += 1`. So its completeness rung
is the smite rung plus (a) the `harm` delta and range teeth on its own arm and (b) the
`harmRider`, which fires on ANY method that moves the slot and therefore has to be
discharged here rather than assumed. -/

/-! ### ⚑ THE NEW VERB — `take`, the one step in the rulebook that LOWERS a custody code.

`take` is `loot` minus the guardian tooth, one zone over: the relic is not lying in a
hoard under a standing guardian, it is hanging in a door already opened. So its
completeness rung is the loot rung with the hoard frame replaced by the DOOR frame, and
the hop it must exhibit is `HUNG + depth → CARRIED` rather than `home → CARRIED`. The
carry slot is charged all the same, at the identical posted price, and the capacity
commons in `coreTeeth` price it against depth and harm exactly as they price a loot. -/
