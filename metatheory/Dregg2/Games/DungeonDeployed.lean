# Dregg2.Games.DungeonDeployed — the descent teeth RE-BASED onto the DEPLOYED evaluator.

`DungeonProgram.lean` proves the admission-soundness inversions over the signed-`Int`
`Exec.RecordProgram` model, and its header (written at `dc95b4d5ff`) records the descent as
TWO steps short of the tug's `program_admits_legal_play_deployed`: (1) vocabulary — the
descent's `affineLe`/`allowedTransitions`/`inRangeTwoSided`/`fieldDelta` were then outside
`Dregg2.Exec.DeployedConstraint`'s exported pure subset — and (2) signedness — the
inversions quantify over arbitrary signed `Exec.Value`s where the two evaluators genuinely
diverge. This module closes what is now closable, by PROOF:

* **The REGISTER vocabulary gap is GONE.** The `CIRCUIT-LEAN-BOUNDARY` widening put
  `affineLe`, `allowedTransitions`, `inRangeTwoSided`, `fieldDelta`, `memberOf` and the
  flat `AnyOf` parity branches into the `@[export dregg_constraint_admits]` evaluator's
  decided subset.

  ⚑ **THE REMAINDER IS THREE SHAPES NOW, NOT ONE — AND IT GREW BECAUSE THE RULEBOOK DID.**
  Re-based 2026-07-28 against the key-in-the-door rewrite (`f79dae644` … `b15c958fe`), which
  gave the descent an eighth verb, moved the door frame off four registers onto the relic,
  and put a per-object HOP TABLE where a monotone atom used to be. `Constraint.toDTop` is
  `none` on exactly (and the ledger in §9 COUNTS them, so none can leave quietly):

    1. `countFieldsEq` — the 6 census teeth. Unchanged; `DConstraint.fieldsCountEquals`
       exists but the resolved-cells run is not marshalled here.
    2. `heapField _ (.allowedTransitions …)` — the 8 per-relic custody HOP tables.
       ⚑ UPDATED 2026-07-30: `DHeapAtom` NOW carries a twelfth arm,
       `allowedTransitions (allowed : List (Nat × Nat))` (u64 lane, both sides present, no
       genesis escape), with a `HAT` wire token in `parseHeapAtom` and a PROVED
       encode/decode round-trip (`Dregg2.Exec.DeployedConstraint.
       parseHeapAtom_renderHeapAllowedTransitions`, over every `allowed` list) — closing
       the release-visible outage this arm's absence caused
       (`exec-lean/tests/heap_allowed_transitions_wire_gap.rs`,
       `cell/tests/heap_allowed_transitions_lean_sourced.rs`). `HeapAtom.toDHeap` below is
       DELIBERATELY UNCHANGED — it still lowers `.allowedTransitions _` to `none` — because
       routing THIS descent's hop tooth through the new arm still needs the `tr_heapField`
       proof pattern (the transport theorem), which is separate, larger, ember-gated work
       this Lean arm does not itself discharge. `exec-lean/src/constraint_oracle.rs`'s
       `encode_heap_atom` also still declines the atom (another lane's WIP) — so the arm
       existing here is NECESSARY but not yet SUFFICIENT for the deployed wire to reach it.
    3. `anyOf` carrying a `heapField` branch — the 24 object-side DOOR-FRAME teeth
       (`doorArrivalTooth`/`doorDepartureTooth`) and `keyHangsHereTooth`. This one is a
       MARSHALLING limit, not a vocabulary one: `dgInput` resolves ONE heap key per tooth,
       so an `anyOf` branch reading a relic's custody key would be handed `heapOld =
       heapNew = none` and fail closed while the Exec branch reads the record and can be
       TRUE. Lowering it would be a LIE about the marshalled image. Closing it is
       `dgInput` resolving the key an `anyOf` mentions plus a `heapField` arm in
       `branch_agree` (which needs the full iff, both directions).

  So the honest reading of the flagship below is: 38 of the spent rider's teeth are NOT
  carried to the deployed evaluator by this bridge, and the per-relic `memberOf` custody
  alphabet, conservation, capacity, the ranges, the clock and the fate machine ARE. The
  Exec-level ∀-weld (`reachable_step_admitted`) covers all of them; this file is about how
  many reach the UNSIGNED deployed evaluator.

* **The Int→Nat bridge is a THEOREM** (`tooth_transport` + `descent_step_teeth_deployed`),
  not an assumption: the game's states are `Nat`-valued and reachable states are SMALL
  (every register ≤ 30 = BREATH, every custody code ≤ 16 = `HUNG + FLOORS` — `regs_small`/`heap_small`, from `Inv`
  plus the new `Tight` reachability bound), so on the marshalled image the signed `Exec`
  verdict and the unsigned 256-bit deployed verdict AGREE, tooth by tooth. The audit's
  divergence on negative attacker scalars is real but out of scope BY SUBSTRATE here: the
  deployed register file cannot carry a negative value.

* **The inversions land at deployed width** (`deployed_tooth_conserves`/`_capacity`/
  `_pays`/`_alive`): stated DIRECTLY over `DeployedConstraint.admits` and quantifying over
  ARBITRARY `DInput`s — attacker-supplied unsigned 256-bit register files — with no `Exec`
  detour and hence no signedness caveat at all. Each has a refusing negative twin
  (`#guard`) showing the tooth bites.

## The flagship

`descent_step_teeth_deployed`: for every RECEIPT-REACHABLE state `s` and legal model step
`step s m = some s'`, EVERY tooth of EVERY matching case (verb arms AND `SlotChanged`
riders) that lies in the deployed subset evaluates to `.ok` under
`Dregg2.Exec.DeployedConstraint.admitsTop` on the marshalled register/heap input — i.e.
the `@[export dregg_constraint_admits]` evaluator the deployed node routes through ADMITS
the descent's legal play, tooth by tooth. This is the descent twin of the tug's
`program_admits_legal_play_deployed` (`MultiwayTugProgram §4I`), riding the completeness
∀-weld (`reachable_step_admitted`) instead of a driven single run.

## Honest scope (what is NOT claimed)

* **Guard dispatch stays executor-level.** `MethodIs`/`SlotChanged` case selection is the
  Rust executor's loop (same boundary as the tug §4I refinement); the theorems here are
  per-tooth verdicts conditional on the (Exec-mirrored) guard matching.
* **Verdicts are at the `admits`/`admitsTop` level** — the same function `admitsFFI`
  wraps; the String wire codec's faithfulness is `DeployedConstraint.lean`'s own `#guard`
  battery, not re-proven here.
* **The genesis mint is NOT re-based.** Its `deltaEquals` sentinel tooth reads the OLD
  heap key, and on a genuinely-absent pre-genesis key the deployed atom fails closed
  (`some a` required) while the Exec drive models the sentinel as present-`0`
  (`preGenesis`). That absent-vs-zero first-write seam is the same class the tug
  reconciliation documented; the verb cases proven here never touch it (`oldPresent` with
  both states materialized).
* **The census remainder is DESIGNED, not fired here** (`countFieldsEq`, six teeth):
  closing it requires the deployed evaluator's exported subset to carry the N-key
  aggregate — kernel-adjacent deployed admission logic, ember-gated, NOT this lane's to
  fire. The precise design + the falsifier that shows the gap are in §9; the `#guard`
  battery proves the teeth THIS module lowers (everything else) admit the
  two-relic/one-counter census forgery, so the census tooth is load-bearing, not
  decorative. ⚑ While this file was being authored, a CONCURRENT lane landed (as
  working-tree WIP) a `DConstraint.fieldsCountEquals` arm + `DInput.cells` run in
  `DeployedConstraint.lean` — convergent with the §9 design. This module's lowering
  deliberately does NOT ride that WIP yet (`toDTop` still maps `countFieldsEq` to
  `none`): the census transport is the named follow-up once that widening COMMITS.

Substrate said out loud: this is the Lean-authored CONSTRAINT-PROGRAM layer (law-#1
compliant — the teeth and both evaluators are Lean); no AIR/circuit object is authored or
touched here.

/-! ## 4. The lowering into the deployed subset (`toDTop`) + the decidable side
conditions the transport needs (`toothOK`), discharged once for the WHOLE program. -/

/-- Lower an `anyOf`-liftable simple tooth to a deployed `(parity, atom)` branch —
exactly the peeled-`Not` shape `eval.rs::evaluate_simple_constraint` reduces to.

⚑ `none` on `Simple.heapField`, and that is a MARSHALLING fact, not a vocabulary one:
`DConstraint.heapField` exists, but `dgInput` resolves ONE heap key per tooth (the
top-level `heapField`'s), and an `anyOf` branch that reads a relic's custody key would be
handed `heapOld = heapNew = none` and fail closed while the Exec branch reads the record
and can be TRUE. Lowering it would be a lie about the marshalled image, so the whole
`anyOf` stays out of subset — see §9's remainder ledger. -/

/-- The descent heap atoms embed into the deployed heap-atom vocabulary VERBATIM —
except the hop TABLE, DELIBERATELY, for now. ⚑ UPDATED 2026-07-30: `DHeapAtom` NOW HAS an
`allowedTransitions` arm (§9 ledger item 2 above has the detail) — the transition table IS
in the exported subset as of this arm landing. This `toDHeap` still lowers
`.allowedTransitions _` to `none` anyway, because routing the descent's OWN hop tooth
through it needs the `tr_heapField` transport theorem (separate, larger, ember-gated
work), not just the arm existing. So the per-relic custody hop tooth still lowers to
`none` and joins the §9 remainder; its companion `memberOf (custodyAlphabet i)` lowers as
before. -/

/-! ## 8. The INVERSIONS at deployed width — over ARBITRARY unsigned inputs.

`DungeonProgram §4`'s inversions quantify over arbitrary signed `Exec.Value`s; the
audit's honest bound was that they cannot be re-stated over `DeployedConstraint` for
arbitrary values because of the signed/unsigned divergence. These four theorems are
the RE-BASED inversions: stated DIRECTLY over `DeployedConstraint.admits`, quantifying
over arbitrary `DInput`s — attacker-supplied unsigned 256-bit register files. On the
deployed substrate the divergence is out of scope BY TYPE, so no caveat remains: if
the exported evaluator admits the tooth, the law holds on the deployed lanes. -/

/-! ## 9. THE DESIGNED REMAINDER — the `countFieldsEq` census teeth (NOT fired).

**The gap.** The six `projectionTeeth` (`countFieldsEq relicKeys v reg` — the exact
object↔projection census binding `pack`/`bank`/each hoard to the eight custody keys)
lower to Rust `StateConstraint::FieldsCountEquals` (`cell/src/program/eval.rs:1990`),
which `exec-lean/src/constraint_oracle.rs` enumerates in the NAMED trusted-Rust slot
("heap SHAPES not yet on the wire"). `Constraint.toDTop` is `none` on exactly this
constructor — the partition is total and kernel-checked (`census_is_the_remainder`).

**The falsifier (the gap BITES).** The two-relic/one-counter census forgery of
`DungeonProgram` attack 1b, marshalled to the deployed substrate: one hoard unit
debited, `pack += 1`, but TWO custody objects advanced to `CARRIED`. The battery below
proves EVERY in-subset tooth of the spent rider admits this forged transition at
deployed width — conservation, capacity, ranges, both per-object ratchets, the
sentinel freeze ALL pass. Only the census teeth refuse it, and they are evaluated in
trusted Rust. (The Exec-level mutation canary `dungeonExecWithoutProjection` in
`DungeonProgram.lean` already proves the census tooth is the indispensable refusal —
deleting exactly `projectionTeeth` makes the forgery admit.) So the deployed
LEAN-EVALUATED subset alone does NOT refuse the census forgery: the extension is
load-bearing.

**The extension design (ember-gated; NOT fired by this lane).**
Closing this tooth requires extending `Dregg2.Exec.DeployedConstraint`'s exported
subset — deployed admission logic:

1. `DInput` grows a MULTI-KEY heap read (a resolved cell run) — the marshaller
   resolves the N named `fields_map` keys post-state, each absence a first-class
   token (fail-closed, mirroring `get_field_ext` returning `None` ⇒
   `ConstraintViolated` at `eval.rs:1999`).
2. `DConstraint` grows `fieldsCountEquals (n : Nat) (value : DField) (countIdx : Nat)`:
   count FULL-FIELD equality of the first `n` resolved keys against `value` (any
   absent key ⇒ `.violated`), compare the count against the `field_from_u64` image
   in `newRegs.getD countIdx 0`.
3. The wire codec grows one tag, and `constraint_oracle.rs::encode_constraint` moves
   `FieldsCountEquals` from the trusted-Rust enumeration to the encoded subset,
   resolving the N keys exactly as the single-key `HeapField` marshalling does.
4. Acceptance: the differential gate (Lean == Rust across the subset) re-run with the
   census arm included, plus this file's forged battery flipping from all-`.ok` to
   census-`.violated` at deployed width.

⚑ STATUS AT AUTHORING TIME: a CONCURRENT lane's working-tree WIP on
`DeployedConstraint.lean` landed points 1–3 almost verbatim
(`DConstraint.fieldsCountEquals` + `DInput.cells` + the `FCE` tag). This module
compiles against that WIP's widened structures but deliberately does NOT lower
`countFieldsEq` onto the uncommitted arm: the census LOWERING + TRANSPORT (extend
`toDTop`, marshal the 8-key cells run in `dgInput`, prove the transport with the same
pattern as `tr_heapField` — mechanical, all values ≤ 9 and counts ≤ 8) is the named
follow-up once the widening commits and its differential gate is green.

Until then, the honest statement is: the census law is enforced by the deployed node
(Rust `eval.rs`, exercised by the executor tests and the Exec-level inversions), but
it is OUTSIDE what this bridge proves about the Lean-evaluated reality-gated subset. -/

/-- The out-of-subset SHAPES, as a decidable predicate — the remainder ledger, so that a
tooth silently falling out of the deployed bridge is a `#guard` failure and not a
discovery six weeks later. THREE shapes, and each is a fact about the DEPLOYED
vocabulary or the MARSHALLING, never about the tooth being unimportant:

  `countFieldsEq …`                  — the census; `DConstraint.fieldsCountEquals` exists
                                        but the cells run is not marshalled here (§9).
  `heapField _ (allowedTransitions)` — `DHeapAtom` has NO transition table, on either
                                        substrate. This is the per-relic custody HOP tooth.
  `anyOf …` containing a `heapField` — `dgInput` resolves ONE key per tooth; an `anyOf`
                                        branch reading a relic would be handed `none` and
                                        fail closed. This is the object-side DOOR FRAME
                                        (`doorArrivalTooth`/`doorDepartureTooth`) and
                                        `keyHangsHereTooth`. -/
