# Dregg2.Games.DungeonProgram — the DEPLOYED descent cell program, AUTHORED IN LEAN.

The reimagined descent (`Dregg2.Games.Dungeon` — the model, the design laws) is deployed as
THIS `CellProgram` value: emitted to the checked-in artifact
`dungeon-on-dregg/program/dungeon_program.json` (regen + drift-gated by
`dungeon-on-dregg/program/regen.sh`) and loaded by `dungeon_on_dregg::descent`
(`Deployment::program()` resolves the symbolic slot/method names against the
translation-validated `dregg-schema` allocator). There is NO hand-rolled Rust
`CellProgram` in the descent's path — the deployed program IS this Lean object by
construction (edit a rule here, re-emit, and the deployed game changes: the canary).

## What is NEW here relative to the tug pattern (`MultiwayTugProgram.lean`)

1. **Guards are part of the authored object** — not just `MethodIs`: the program carries
   `SlotChanged`-guarded RIDER cases (`slotChangedForMethods`, lowered by the loader to
   `AllOf[SlotChanged, AnyOf[MethodIs…]]`). This retires the standing
   stapleable-slot falsifier *structurally*: ANY verb that moves `depth` pays the delve
   law, ANY verb that flips a `way_w` must EXHIBIT the carried key-relic, ANY verb that
   moves `bank`/`fate` pays the banking law, ANY verb that moves `harm` pays the WHOLE
   lunge law (`harmRider` — the newest slot got its rider in the same change that
   introduced it, not later), and ANY exertion (a `spent` change) pays the
   conservation/ratchet/capacity commons. The method list inside the guard keeps the
   executor's method-default-deny intact (`unknown_method_refused`).

2. **The proofs run against the LAW-#1 evaluator.** `toExec` lifts this program into
   `Dregg2.Exec.RecordProgram` — the name-keyed algebra the Rust evaluator mirrors — and
   the theorems below are admission-soundness INVERSIONS over ARBITRARY record values
   (attacker-supplied writes), not structural pins:
     * `admitted_verb_conserves` — any admitted verb turn's post-state sums the relic
       zones to exactly `RELICS` (no dupe, no burn);
     * `admitted_verb_capacity` — any admitted verb turn satisfies
       `pack + depth + harm ≤ CAP` (attenuation, INCLUDING the grip the guardians broke,
       reaches the deployed teeth);
     * `admitted_verb_pays` — any admitted verb turn strictly spends breath, capped at
       `BREATH` (the clock);
     * `admitted_verb_alive` — any admitted verb turn starts from `fate = 0`
       (the banked tomb is frozen: `banked_tomb_refuses`);
     * `way_flip_exhibits_key` — any admitted turn that flips `way_w` carries the
       `0 → 1` transition AND the post-state holds key-relic `w−1` CARRIED;
     * `unknown_method_refused` — a method outside the seven verbs is default-denied.

3. **Custody projections are exact, not parallel bookkeeping.** The spent rider
   carries six `countFieldsEq` aggregate teeth.  Every ordinary verb therefore proves
   that `pack`, `bank`, and each floor hoard are the exact census of the eight
   individually committed relic custody fields.  A forged loot can neither advance a
   counter without moving a relic nor move two relics behind one `pack += 1` receipt.

4. **The model and the program share ONE substrate** (name-keyed records): `encode`
   embeds the model `DState` into `Exec.Value`, and the `#guard` battery DRIVES the
   crowned run of `Dungeon.lean` through `RecordProgram.admits` step by step — the
   model-legal run IS admitted — while eight named attacks (dupe, keyless way, staple,
   tomb move, dead light, fake flee, relic teleport, genesis replay) are REFUSED.
   Tug could not do this (its model lived on multisets, a different substrate); the
   reimagined dungeon was AUTHORED so the refinement is direct. ⚑ The way-flip inversion is
   now proven for ALL THREE locked ways (`way_flip_exhibits_key` ⇒ `way2/3/4_flip_exhibits_key`),
   closing the audit's "ways 3/4 are Rust-driven" gap.

5. **TWO BLOWS, ONE OF THEM PAID IN CAPACITY.** `smite` (the press: 2 breath, no harm) and
   `lunge` (1 breath, `harm += 1`) wound identically; what separates them is the core
   `affineLe`, which now prices `pack + depth + harm` against `CAP`. Because capacity
   already attenuates with depth, the same posted price is cheap at depth 1 (7 slots) and
   ruinous at depth 4 (4 slots — exactly three keys plus the prize), so a `guardHp = 2`
   floor is a mixable decision rather than a quotient. `harm` is a `[0, HARMCAP]` ratchet:
   `lungeCase` and `harmRider` both carry `fieldDelta harm 1` (an exact step, so it cannot
   run backward) and `inRangeTwoSided harm 0 HARMCAP`, and every other verb FREEZES the
   slot.

## Honest scope

* The theorems hold of the Lean `Exec.RecordProgram` evaluator — a name-keyed record MODEL
  of the referee. ⚑ `docs/audit/GAME-PROOF-LARP-AUDIT.md` correctly flagged that this is NOT the
  evaluator `eval.rs` calls, and that it had DIVERGED from the deployed one: `Exec`'s field
  compares (`affineLe`/`fieldGe`) are signed unbounded `Int`, whereas the deployed field is
  UNSIGNED 256-bit (`eval.rs:2842`). The SEMANTICS axis of that disconnect is now closed at its
  source: the pure (context-free, witness-free) constraint teeth are AUTHORED ONCE over the
  DEPLOYED substrate (`[FieldElement;16]` + heap, UNSIGNED-256) in
  `Dregg2.Exec.DeployedConstraint.admits`, `@[export dregg_constraint_admits]`-ed and CALLED by the
  deployed node (`eval.rs`'s `evaluate_constraint_full` routes the subset through it via the
  `dregg_cell::program::ConstraintOracle` seam installed by `dregg-exec-lean`; the reality-gate
  canary in `dregg-lean-ffi`/`exec-lean` tests proves the deployed decision IS the Lean source, and
  the differential gate pins Lean == Rust across the subset). These dungeon inversions remain over
  the signed-`Int` `Exec` MODEL — their honest scope — and reaching the deployed unsigned evaluator
  is the register-substrate refinement the audit named (NOT re-claimed here). The Rust-side agreement
  the descent crate's executor tests exercise (illegal turns are REAL `WorldError::Refused`) is now
  ALSO backed by the differential gate, not prose alone.
* The per-relic custody ratchet (`monotonic` + `memberOf {home, CARRIED, BANKED}`),
  zone-counter conservation, and the exact custody↔counter census are all enforced.
  The aggregate is over this game's fixed eight custody keys; an unbounded dynamic
  inventory still belongs on the first-class collection/AIR path.

## ⚑ DeployedConstraint refinement — why tug lands and the descent is BOUNDED (LARP-audit fix #4/#5)

The tug game's action teeth ALL live in `Dregg2.Exec.DeployedConstraint`'s exported PURE subset
(`sumEquals`/`writeOnce`/`strictMonotonic`/`fieldGte`/`heapField`-atoms) over NONNEG counters, so
tug's forward refinement was RE-STATED against the deployed evaluator itself
(`MultiwayTugProgram §4I` `program_admits_legal_play_deployed`). The descent is TWO honest steps
short of that, and this is a structural fact, not an omission:

  1. **Vocabulary.** The descent's teeth use `affineLe` (capacity), `allowedTransitions`
     (fate/way), `inRangeTwoSided` (zone ranges) and `fieldDelta` (posted prices) — NONE of which
     are in `DeployedConstraint`'s exported pure subset (which is context-free/witness-free field &
     heap atoms). Only `admitted_verb_conserves` (`sumEquals`) and `admitted_verb_pays`
     (`strictMonotonic`+`fieldLte`) sit inside the pure subset; capacity/alive/way-flip do not.
  2. **Signedness.** The inversions quantify over ARBITRARY `Exec.Value`s, where a scalar is a
     SIGNED unbounded `Int`. `DeployedConstraint` is UNSIGNED 256-bit `Nat` — the EXACT divergence
     the audit flagged. On a negative attacker scalar the two evaluators genuinely DISAGREE, so an
     arbitrary-`Value` inversion CANNOT be faithfully re-stated over `DeployedConstraint`. The two
     agree only on the NONNEG `encode` image — i.e. via the weld below, not the inversions.

  So the honest descent scope is: the inversions are proven over the signed-`Int` `Exec` MODEL
  (all three ways now included); a faithful `DeployedConstraint` refinement would hold only on the
  nonneg `encode` image and only for the pure-subset teeth (conserves/pays), routed through the
  ∀-weld. That is the NAMED remainder — it needs the ∀-weld (below) plus a nonneg `Int→Nat`
  register marshalling, not a new substrate.

## ⚑ The model↔program WELD — DRIVEN status, honestly (LARP-audit fix #5)

The weld `model-legal step ⟹ program-admitted` (the FORWARD refinement direction) is DRIVEN, not
yet a ∀-theorem: `programAdmitsRun crownedRun = true` checks it for ONE legal run (genesis + 17
verbs), and nine attack `#guard`s check named forgeries are refused. The GENERAL ∀-weld
(`∀ s m s', step s m = some s' → RecordProgram.admits dungeonExec (moveIdx m) (encode s)
(encode s') = true`) is NAMED, not proven here: it is a per-move, tooth-by-tooth discharge of every
matching verb case + `SlotChanged` rider over the SHARED `Exec` substrate (large — ~5 moves × the
verb+rider teeth, with custody-`countP` conservation/ratchet lemmas — but tractable, and NOT a new
substrate). Several of its consequences ARE already ∀-theorems in the REVERSE direction (the
inversions `admitted_verb_*`, `banked_tomb_refuses`, `dead_light_refuses`, `way{2,3,4}_flip_*`),
which is why the driven attacks each correspond to a proven inversion. What remains driven is the
forward completeness (legal ⇒ admitted) beyond the single crowned run.
