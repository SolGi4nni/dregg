# Dregg2.Games.MultiwayTug — a VERIFIED pure-transition spec for the multiway-tug card game.

Design lineage: the mechanics are derived from **Hanamikoji** (Kota Nakayama). The *shipped*
dregg game is the original re-theming "multiway-tug"; only the name/theme differ — the rules
modelled here are the Hanamikoji rules (2 players, 7 "guild" rows with charm values
`[2,2,2,3,3,4,5]` = 21, a 21-card deck holding `charm g` copies of each row `g`, a hidden
6-card hand, four once-per-round actions Secret / Discard / Gift / Competition, control of a
row goes to whoever placed MORE on it, win at ≥ 11 charm OR ≥ 4 rows).

## ⚑ THE ENGINE IS `I-CUT-YOU-CHOOSE` — restored (2026-07-25)

Hanamikoji's whole engine is a cake-cutting dilemma: on Gift you REVEAL three favors and the
**opponent takes one**; on Competition you reveal four as **two pairs you chose** and the
opponent **takes a pair**. The actor cuts; the other seat chooses.

This model USED TO PRE-FOLD that choice — `gift (self₁ self₂ other)` let the acting player
declare who got what, and there was no opponent step anywhere in the transition system. With
the split pre-folded there is no dilemma and (given a scripted mover) no decision at all: a
whole match was a pure function of the deal seed. That is fixed here. A `Gift`/`Competition`
action now only PRESENTS cards; they land in escrow as a `pending : Option Offer`; and the
OTHER seat's `Response` decides the split. The transition alphabet is `Move := act | respond`.

The three decisions a player now owns, each with a theorem below saying it is real:

  1. **WHICH action, WHEN** — `legalB` only requires the kind unused, and
     `every_action_order_is_feasible` proves ALL 24 orderings are card-feasible, so the order
     is a free choice over a fully-available space (the Rust engine used to hardcode ONE).
  2. **THE CUT** — which cards to present, and (Competition) how to PAIR them.
     `comp_balanced_cut_dominates` / `gift_modest_cut_dominates` prove the guaranteed swing
     depends on the cut, so the cut is a decision with a wrong answer.
  3. **THE CHOICE** — `respond_decides_the_round` exhibits one pending offer whose two
     responses hand the round to DIFFERENT players. That is the falsifier for "a player
     decides nothing", discharged as a theorem.

## What is PROVEN here (the pure model — real, non-vacuous, `#assert_axioms`-clean)

  1. **CONSERVATION** (`conservation`, `conservation_response`, `conservation_move`) — the total
     card multiset (`removed + deck + hands + secrets + discard-piles + placed + escrow`) is
     INVARIANT under every move. Genuine multiset arithmetic (`Multiset.sub_add_cancel`), NOT
     `by decide` on a toy. Lifted to whole executions along the `Boundary` keystone
     (`conservation_along_run`). The escrow is DERIVED from `pending` (`pendingCards`), so
     "an offer's cards are somewhere" is definitional, not an invariant to maintain.
  2. **ONE-ACTION-PER-ROUND** (`used_monotone`, `legal_needs_unused`) — a monotone used-set.
     A `Response` consumes NO flag (responding is not one of your four actions), which is why
     `Move` splits into `act`/`respond` rather than adding a fifth `ActionKind`.
  3. **THE OFFER INTERLOCK** (`pending_blocks_actions`, `respond_needs_pending`,
     `respond_not_by_proposer`) — while an offer is pending NOTHING but a response is legal; a
     response with no pending offer is refused; and **the proposer cannot answer their own
     offer**. That last one is the anti-self-deal tooth: without it I-cut-you-choose silently
     collapses back into the pre-folded gift this file just deleted.
  4. **SCORING** — control goes to whoever placed more (`control_correct`); raw placement counts
     only accrue (`geishaCount_mono`); and the Secret card IS scored (`secret_is_scored`).
  5. **WIN-SAFETY** — `Won` (≥ 11 charm OR ≥ 4 rows) as a `Good`-style predicate, plus the
     adjudicated `roundWinner` (§7B) that took draws from 66.1% to 5.1%.

/-! ## 7B. ⚑ THE ADJUDICATED ROUND WINNER — the fix for the 66% draw rate

**The design wound.** `Won` is an ABSOLUTE threshold and the shipped game is ONE round, so a
round in which neither player clears the bar had NO WINNER. **Measured: 66.1% of rounds ended
with no winner at all.**

**Why, exactly.** `∑ g, charm g = 21` and `control` awards a row to at most one player, so
`charmScore p1 + charmScore p2 ≤ 21` (`charmScore_add_le`) — if every row were controlled the sum
would be 21, forcing one player to ≥ 11. So EVERY undecided round is caused by TIED rows going
uncontrolled and their charm evaporating.

**The fix.** Adjudicating an undecided round on total charm, then rows held, leaves **5.1%**
draws at 41.2% / 53.7%. It does not touch `control`, so the emitted win-gate teeth keep meaning
exactly what they meant, and `Won` is UNCHANGED and still the first thing `roundWinner` asks. -/

/-! ### The CLAUSE that decided the round

`roundWinner` is a PRECEDENCE, and which of its nine clauses fired is itself a fact about the
round — "p1 won on charm" and "p1 won because p2 held fewer rows at equal charm" are different
outcomes even though both name p1. `roundWinnerBranch` names the clause; `branchWinner` reads the
seat back off it, and `roundWinner_eq_branchWinner` proves the two carry exactly the same content.

This matters DOWNSTREAM rather than here: the deployed teeth (`MultiwayTugProgram`) cannot express
a disjunction of cross-register comparisons inside one case, so each clause becomes its own
transition case and the CLAUSE is what a scoring turn names. A caller therefore has to be told
which clause fired — and it is told by this function through the oracle, not by re-deciding the
precedence in its own language. -/

/-- The clause of `roundWinner` that decides `s`, `0..8` in precedence order: charm-threshold p1,
charm-threshold p2, row-threshold p1, row-threshold p2, charm-lead p1, charm-lead p2, row-lead p1,
row-lead p2, dead heat. -/

This is what makes a caller's wire encoding faithful WITHOUT it having to reconstruct zones it does
not track: a caller that reports the true `geishaCount` of every `(seat, row)` gets the true
adjudication, whatever it writes in the other zones. It is stated as a theorem rather than left as
an assumption in a comment because it is exactly the assumption the FFI caller relies on. -/

/-! ## 7C. ⚑⚑ THE THREE DECISIONS, AS THEOREMS

This is the section that answers "a player currently decides nothing". Each of the three
restored decisions gets a theorem saying it is a REAL choice: different inputs, different
outcomes, over the SAME position. -/

/-! ### Decision 1 — WHICH action, WHEN. -/

/-- The cards an action-kind consumes after that turn's draw (`4,3,2,1`). -/
def kindCost : ActionKind → ℕ
  | .competitionK => 4
  | .giftK => 3
  | .discardK => 2
  | .secretK => 1

/-- Is a proposed ORDER of the four action-kinds card-feasible from a 6-card opening with one
draw per action-turn? After `k` turns you have drawn `k` cards, so the cumulative spend of the
first `k` actions must never exceed `6 + k`. -/
def orderFeasible (o : List ActionKind) : Bool :=
  (List.range (o.length + 1)).all
    (fun k => decide (((o.take k).map kindCost).sum ≤ 6 + k))

/-- The 24 orderings of the four once-per-round actions. -/
def allOrders : List (List ActionKind) :=
  let ks := [ActionKind.secretK, .discardK, .giftK, .competitionK]
  (ks.flatMap fun a => (ks.filter (· != a)).flatMap fun b =>
    ((ks.filter (· != a)).filter (· != b)).flatMap fun c =>
      (((ks.filter (· != a)).filter (· != b)).filter (· != c)).map fun d => [a, b, c, d])

/-- **`every_action_order_is_feasible` (DECISION 1 IS REAL).** ALL 24 orderings of the four
once-per-round actions are card-feasible — the descending `[Competition, Gift, Discard, Secret]`
the Rust engine hardcoded for BOTH seats was one arbitrary point in a space that was always
fully available. `legalB` requires only that the kind be unused, so the whole space is legal;
this theorem says none of it is a card-starvation trap. -/
theorem every_action_order_is_feasible : allOrders.all orderFeasible = true := by decide

/-- Non-vacuity of the sweep: there really are 24 orders (not an empty `all`). -/
theorem allOrders_card : allOrders.length = 24 := by decide

/-- The falsifier for `orderFeasible`: a 5-cost action would NOT be feasible first, so the
predicate can go false and `every_action_order_is_feasible` is a real check. -/
theorem orderFeasible_can_fail :
    orderFeasible [ActionKind.competitionK, .competitionK, .competitionK] = false := by decide

/-! ### Decision 2 — THE CUT (the cake-cutting dilemma, quantified). -/

/-- The raw influence of a multiset of favors. -/
def weight (m : Multiset Geisha) : ℕ := (m.map charm).sum

/-- The **swing** a response produces for the CUTTER: their share minus the taker's. -/
def swing (o : Offer) (r : Response) : Int :=
  (weight (cutterShare o r) : Int) - (weight (takerShare o r) : Int)

/-- The cutter's **guaranteed swing**: the worst the taker can do to them. This is the value a
proposer is actually choosing when they choose a cut — the taker will pick the response that
minimises it. -/
def guarantee : Offer → Int
  | o@(.gift _ _ _ _) => min (min (swing o (.gift 0)) (swing o (.gift 1))) (swing o (.gift 2))
  | o@(.comp _ _ _ _ _) => min (swing o (.comp 0)) (swing o (.comp 1))

/-- **`comp_balanced_cut_dominates` (DECISION 2 IS REAL — the cake-cutting dilemma).**

The SAME four favors (rows `6,5,0,1`, charm `5,4,2,2`), paired two ways:

  * lopsided `{5,4} | {2,2}` guarantees the cutter **−5** (the taker simply takes the big pair);
  * balanced  `{5,2} | {4,2}` guarantees the cutter **−1**.

So the PAIRING — a thing the shipped game never let a player express, because the split was
pre-folded into the actor's own action — strictly changes what the cutter can guarantee. This
is the agonising bit of Hanamikoji restored as a checked inequality: you must cut so that you
are content with EITHER half, because you do not get to choose which one you keep. -/
theorem comp_balanced_cut_dominates :
    guarantee (.comp .p1 6 5 0 1) = -5
      ∧ guarantee (.comp .p1 6 0 5 1) = -1
      ∧ guarantee (.comp .p1 6 5 0 1) < guarantee (.comp .p1 6 0 5 1) := by
  refine ⟨by decide, by decide, by decide⟩

/-- **`gift_modest_cut_dominates` (DECISION 2, the Gift face).**

Presenting your three STRONGEST favors (rows `6,5,0` = charm `5,4,2`) guarantees a swing of only
**+1** — the opponent just takes the `5`. Presenting three modest ones (`0,1,2` = charm `2,2,2`)
guarantees **+2**. The strong presentation has the higher raw total and the WORSE guarantee:
what you present is a decision with a wrong answer, and the wrong answer is the greedy one the
`pick_highest` mover always played. -/
theorem gift_modest_cut_dominates :
    guarantee (.gift .p1 6 5 0) = 1
      ∧ guarantee (.gift .p1 0 1 2) = 2
      ∧ guarantee (.gift .p1 6 5 0) < guarantee (.gift .p1 0 1 2) := by
  refine ⟨by decide, by decide, by decide⟩

/-! ### Decision 3 — THE CHOICE (the theorem this whole lane exists for). -/

/-- A live position with a pending Gift: P1 has cut three favors (rows `6`, `0`, `2` — charm
`5, 2, 2`) and P2 is to answer. The board already standing: P2 holds rows `3` and `4` (charm
`3 + 3`), P1 holds row `1` (charm `2`). -/
def cutState : GState :=
  { blankState with
    placed := fun p => if p = .p1 then ({1} : Multiset Geisha) else ({3, 4} : Multiset Geisha)
    pending := some (.gift .p1 6 0 2)
    current := .p2
    used := fun p k => p = .p1 ∧ k = .giftK }

/-- The position is REAL: P2's response is legal (so `applyResponse` is not a silent no-op and
the theorem below is not about two copies of the same state). -/
theorem cutState_response_legal (k : Fin 3) : legalRespB cutState .p2 (.gift k) = true := by
  fin_cases k <;> rfl

/-- ⚑ **`respond_decides_the_round` — THE FALSIFIER, DISCHARGED.**

From ONE pending offer, in ONE position, the responder's two answers hand the round to DIFFERENT
players:

  * take the `5`-charm favor → P2 reaches `3 + 3 + 5 = 11` charm and **P2 wins outright**;
  * take a `2`-charm favor instead → P2 has `8`, P1 has `2 + 5 + 2 = 9`, and **P1 wins**.

The shipped game had no step at which anyone could make this choice: `advance` took no card
argument, the split was pre-folded into the actor's own action, and the "opponent's genuine
choice" was a `max_by_key`. This theorem is the machine-checked statement that a player now
decides the outcome. -/

REFUSED, so `respond_decides_the_round`'s choice genuinely belongs to the other seat. -/
