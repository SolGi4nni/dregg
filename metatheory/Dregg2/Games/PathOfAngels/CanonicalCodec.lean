# CanonicalCodec — a `Canonical` deriving handler for the PoA wire tower.

## What this replaces

`Wire`/`Runtime` across Path-of-Angels is ~9,880 lines, most of it canonical codec
plumbing written by hand once per type: an encoder that concatenates JSON text in a fixed
key order, a strict `Except String T` parser that re-lists the same keys, and one roundtrip
theorem. Measured 2026-08-05: **33 `_reencodes` theorems across 8 modules, and 8 separate
copies of the same generic `canonicalDecode_reencodes` lemma** — one per module, each proved
again. `NightWatchLoopWire.lean` alone is 124 defs against 15 theorems in 1,638 lines.

Coverage is uneven by ACCIDENT, because each module's author chose which facts to name.

## What is DETERMINED and what is CHOSEN

Metaprogram what is determined; hand-write what is chosen.

* **Determined** (derived here): the key spelling from the field name, the encoder's byte
  layout, the strict reader, the well-formedness predicate the reader enforces, and the
  roundtrip theorem tying them together.
* **Chosen** (still hand-written, deliberately): which fields exist, the wire bound on each
  field type, whether a record carries a `"format"` tag, every semantic admission gate, and
  every refusal that is about the GAME rather than about the bytes. This handler cannot and
  must not touch those.

## The law is a FIELD, not a test

`FieldCodec` carries `read_toJson` as a structure field. A codec whose reader disagrees
with its writer therefore fails to TYPECHECK; it is not a red test that someone can delete.
The record-level roundtrip is assembled from those field laws, so a derived roundtrip
theorem cannot be weaker than its parts. `Dregg2/Games/PathOfAngels/CanonicalCodecFalsifier.lean`
calibrates that this rejection actually fires, in both polarities.

## ⚑ THE TWO HONEST BOUNDARIES — read before citing anything derived here

**(a) The derived roundtrip lives at the ROW layer, not the byte layer.**
`readRow_toRow` says: for every well-formed value, the strict reader accepts the writer's
canonical row and returns that same value. It does NOT say `decodeBytes (render v) = some v`.
Reaching the byte layer requires `Lean.Json.parse (render v) = .ok (rowToJson (toRow v))` —
adequacy of Lean's own JSON *parser* against this renderer, over an arbitrary value. That is
a real theorem about `Lean.Json.parse`, it is not proved anywhere in this repository, and it
is not proved here. It is named once, as `RowAdapterFaithful` / `ParserAdequate`, so it stops
being invisible; the only evidence in tree for it remains per-fixture `native_decide`.

**(b) The row layer is a `List`, deliberately, and that is load-bearing.**
`Json.obj` is backed by `Std.TreeMap.Raw`, whose `ofList`/`get?` do not reduce under `rfl`
in a form a per-type proof can rely on. `List.lookup`-shaped literal-row matching does. So
the derived reader reads a `Row = List (String × Json)` and a thin, TYPE-INDEPENDENT adapter
(`jsonToRow`) crosses to `Json`. Crossing once, in one place, is why the adapter obligation
above is a single named fact rather than one per derived type.

Neither boundary is new debt: no PoA module proves the byte-layer direction for a general
value today either. The difference is that here it is named.

/-! ## The canonical row -/

/-- The canonical object SPINE: an ordered key/value list. Both the derived writer and the
derived strict reader talk to this, so a per-type roundtrip proof never has to reduce a
`Std.TreeMap.Raw`. Order is significant — it is the byte order the renderer emits. -/
abbrev Row := List (String × Lean.Json)

/-- The wire integer ceiling PoA uses everywhere (`WIRE_U64_MAX` in `NightWatchLoopWire`,
`WIRE_U64_LIMIT` in `ActivatedContentRuntime`). Restated here so the derived `Nat` codec
carries the SAME refusal the hand-written `objectNat` carries, not a laxer one. -/
abbrev WIRE_U64_MAX : Nat := 2 ^ 64 - 1

/-! ## Field codecs — the law is a field -/

/-- A canonical field codec: a JSON writer, a canonical TEXT renderer, a strict reader, the
well-formedness the reader enforces, and — as a FIELD, not a test — the law tying them.

`read_toJson` is why a wrong codec cannot be packaged: there is no inhabitant to supply.
`ok` is what makes a bounded field honest — the law is conditional on exactly the bound the
reader checks, so a codec cannot advertise a bound it does not enforce (or enforce one it
does not advertise; the falsifier pins both directions). -/
structure FieldCodec (α : Type) where
  /-- The values the reader will accept back. -/
  ok : α → Bool
  /-- Structured canonical JSON for one field value. -/
  toJson : α → Lean.Json
  /-- Canonical TEXT for one field value — the exact bytes the encoder emits. -/
  render : α → String
  /-- Strict reader. Must refuse anything outside `ok`. -/
  read : Lean.Json → Except String α
  /-- THE LAW. Not a test: an uninhabited field is a type error at construction. -/
  read_toJson : ∀ a, ok a = true → read (toJson a) = Except.ok a

/-- The codec registry. A field type with no instance CANNOT be derived — that is the
refusal, and it is the mechanism by which coverage stays uneven-BY-DESIGN rather than
uneven-by-accident. Adding an instance means proving `read_toJson`, so the registry
cannot grow without the proof growing with it. -/
class HasFieldCodec (α : Type) where
  codec : FieldCodec α

/-! ### `Nat` -/

/-- Canonical JSON for a `Nat`: an integral number with zero exponent. Written against the
constructors rather than `Lean.Json`'s coercion patterns so the reader's match reduces. -/
def natToJson (n : Nat) : Lean.Json := .num ⟨Int.ofNat n, 0⟩

/-- Strict `Nat` reader: refuses non-numbers, negatives, any exponent, and anything over
the wire bound. The exponent-zero requirement is canonicality, not pedantry — `1e1` and `10`
are the same number and only one of them is the canonical spelling. -/

    natRead limit (natToJson n) = Except.ok n := by
  have hle : n ≤ limit := of_decide_eq_true bounded
  simp [natRead, natToJson, hle]

hand-written PoA encoder already emits for a numeric field. -/

/-! ### ⚑ DELIBERATELY ABSENT: `Digest32`

There is NO `HasFieldCodec Digest32`, and there must not be one until this is a theorem:

    Emit.parseBytes32Hex? (Emit.bytes32Hex d) = some d

Measured 2026-08-05, that lemma does not exist anywhere in this tree. `Emit.lean` proves two
`native_decide` POINT vectors (`parseBytes32Hex_test_federation_vector`,
`parseBytes32Hex_refuses_display_label`) and nothing general. Until it exists, a digest-bearing
record REFUSES to derive — see `CanonicalCodecFalsifier.SealBearingWire`. That refusal is the
feature: the alternative is a derived theorem that quietly omits the digest fields, which is
exactly the uniform-looking vacuity this handler exists to prevent.

This single missing lemma is what blocks `WorldWire`, `OfficerWire`, `VisitKeyWire`,
`ServingWire` and every envelope type from a derived roundtrip. It is the highest-value
next unit of work in this area, and it is NOT done here. -/

/-! ## Field helpers the generated code names

The handler emits calls to these rather than to `HasFieldCodec.codec` directly, so the type
argument is fixed by an ordinary unification against a value or an existing projection, and
the generated syntax never has to render a type. -/

def fieldJson {α : Type} [HasFieldCodec α] (a : α) : Lean.Json := (HasFieldCodec.codec).toJson a
def fieldRender {α : Type} [HasFieldCodec α] (a : α) : String := (HasFieldCodec.codec).render a

it exists only so the elaborator knows which codec to resolve. -/

    Except String α := (HasFieldCodec.codec).read j

    (wellFormed : fieldOk a = true) : fieldReadFor proj (fieldJson a) = Except.ok a :=
  (HasFieldCodec.codec).read_toJson a wellFormed

/-! ## The derived interface -/

/-- What deriving `Canonical` produces. `readRow_toRow` is the non-vacuous half — the half
no PoA module proves today for a general value. -/
class Canonical (α : Type) where
  keys : List String
  toRow : α → Row
  readRow : Row → Except String α
  wf : α → Bool
  render : α → String
  readRow_toRow : ∀ a, wf a = true → readRow (toRow a) = Except.ok a

/-! ## The `Json` adapter — crossed ONCE, for every derived type -/

def rowToJson (row : Row) : Lean.Json := Lean.Json.mkObj row

/-- Field count of a JSON object, via the same fold `Lean.Json`'s own `beq'` uses. -/
def objFieldCount (kvs : Std.TreeMap.Raw String Lean.Json compare) : Nat :=
  kvs.foldl (init := 0) (fun n _ _ => n + 1)

/-- Project a JSON object onto the canonical row for `keys`. Refuses a non-object, a missing
key, and — via the count — any UNKNOWN key, which is what makes the crossing as strict as the
hand-written `exactKeys`. Key ORDER is then re-imposed downstream by the literal-row match in
the derived reader, which `exactKeys` does not do. -/
def jsonToRow (keys : List String) (j : Lean.Json) : Except String Row :=
  match j with
  | .obj kvs =>
      if objFieldCount kvs = keys.length then
        keys.mapM fun k =>
          match kvs.get? k with

          | none => Except.error ("missing field " ++ k)
      else Except.error "object carries unknown or duplicated fields"
  | _ => Except.error "expected an object"

/-- ⚑ **UNDISCHARGED, NAMED.** The adapter leg: reading back the object built from a
canonical row recovers that row. Not proved — `Std.TreeMap.Raw.ofList`/`get?` would have to
be reasoned through, and this repo has no such development. Every derived codec depends on
it to reach the byte layer, so it is stated once here rather than assumed silently in each. -/
def RowAdapterFaithful (keys : List String) (row : Row) : Prop :=
  jsonToRow keys (rowToJson row) = Except.ok row

/-- ⚑ **UNDISCHARGED, NAMED.** The parser leg: Lean's own JSON parser recovers exactly the
object this renderer wrote. Not proved for a general value anywhere in this repository; the

roundtrips" from reading as a theorem about all values. -/

`BazaarGameRuntime`, `CrewFieldMissionRuntime`, `DarkBazaarJudgeWire`, `EventBatchRuntime`,
`GalleyMaintenanceDailyRuntime`, `NetworkGenesisWire`, `NetworkJudgeWire` and
`NightWatchLoopWire` — eight proofs of one fact. This is that fact, once. -/

/-- Canonicality: an accepted byte string is the unique canonical spelling of the value it
decodes to. This is the `_reencodes` shape, and it is TRUE — but see the falsifier: on its
own it is satisfied by a decoder that accepts nothing. It is the derived `readRow_toRow`
that supplies the missing half. -/

Every derived theorem is closed by this macro, so if the reduction ever needs a different

⚑ There is deliberately **no `first` combinator here.** A `first` whose earlier branch can
succeed without closing the goal commits to that branch and lets Lean fill the remainder with

/-- `#assert_term_elaborates (e)` — the POSITIVE CONTROL, exact dual of `#assert_term_refused`
and sharing the same `runProbe`, so the two go blind together or not at all.

A pure rejector cannot detect its own blindness: a `#assert_term_refused` that refused
EVERYTHING — because `runProbe` mis-restored state, because `hasSorry` started firing on
every term, because `liftTermElabM` began throwing for an unrelated reason — would report
every fixture in the file as correctly refused. Pinning that an HONEST codec still elaborates
turns that failure into a red instead of a green. This is the same discipline
`Dregg2/Tactics.lean` applies with `#assert_depends_on` against `#assert_not_depends_on`;
an ordinary `example` does not serve, because it does not go through `runProbe`. -/

/-- `#assert_codec_nonvacuous Foo` — the anti-vacuity gate on a DERIVED roundtrip. A derived
theorem that looks like uniform coverage and proves nothing is worse than fourteen honest
hand-written ones, so this refuses on every way it could be hollow:

* `Foo.readRow_toRow` must EXIST and be a theorem;
* its conclusion must be an equation whose right side is headed by `Except.ok` — this is what
  rejects the `decode b = some v → encode v = b` shape, which the falsifier proves is
  satisfied by a decoder that accepts nothing;
* its left side must be headed by `Foo.readRow`, so it is about the derived reader;
* it must quantify over a binder of type `Foo`, so it is not a statement about one point;
* `Foo.canonWf_witness` must exist — a conditional roundtrip whose condition is unsatisfiable
  is vacuous in a second, quieter way, and the author supplies the witness because the
  handler cannot invent an inhabitant;
* both must be kernel-clean, via the SAME `Dregg2.assertNameClean` every other pin uses. -/
