# Dregg2.Games.PathOfAngels.Judged — executable runtime admission

`JudgedRun` is abstract outside this module.  It is produced only by
`judgeActive`, which checks an exact active game/config projection, all content
and activation domains, the authenticated carrying-turn context, and the current
canonical player counter before invoking one concrete game judge.

The semantic judge remains publicly replayable.  Network authority is not source
secrecy and is not an unconstructible token: the adapter must derive
`FinalizedCarrier` from the already-finalized Dregg turn/receipt, then this module
checks every value it consumes.  A caller can model those inputs, but cannot forge
a `JudgedRun` constructor or bypass the executable equality retained below.

`signal` used to carry `target : Code` and `salvage` a `seed : Fin SEED_SPACE`.
A `RunClaim` is supplied by the game request, so requiring the client to state the
instance required the client to KNOW the instance, which is the hole this split
closes.  The instance is derived inside admission from the slot secret; the claim
states only what a player legitimately has.

`mission` is retained and it still carries `runSeed`, but a claim never supplies a
mission: `admissionChecks` compares the claim against `active.game.configClaim`,
and `active` is assembled by the node from authenticated state. -/

/-- ⚠ The only judge context built from `active` as well as `carrier`, and the
reason is the whole point of Vent Crawl: its hidden table is drawn once per SLOT

There is no way to reach a shared draw through the per-player seed, so the day's
seed is derived here, from the very `slotSecret` that `admissionChecks` has
already pinned to the published `slotCommitment`.

Nothing new is trusted: a node that swapped the secret after publishing is
refused by `judgeActive_uncommitted_secret_refused`, and the same secret that
fixes the player's tape fixes the day's vein.

this is a factoring and not a second door: `hadmitted` is the very proposition the `dite`
decides, and no inhabitant of `JudgedRun` can be built without one.

⚑ Why it is separate.  `admissionChecks` mentions `HiddenInstance.commit` and
`HiddenInstance.runSeedFor`, so *deciding* it evaluates two Poseidon2 sponges.  The
elaborator refuses that (both are `@[irreducible]`) and the KERNEL, which ignores
irreducibility, does it exponentially — MEASURED 47.6 GB / 68 min on one file; see the
`⚑` note in `HiddenInstance`.  A caller that already proved admission by compiled
evaluation therefore cannot use `judgeActive`, because reducing its `dite` recomputes
exactly that decision.  Through this entry the admission is a *proof argument*, erased
by reduction, and the judged run reduces at the cost of the game judge alone. -/
