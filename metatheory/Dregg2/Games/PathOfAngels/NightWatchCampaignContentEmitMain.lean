# Night-watch content emit driver

Renders the epoch-1 `poa.night-watch-campaign.config.v1` component and its
activated-content manifest from `NightWatchCampaignContent`, exactly as the galley's
`scripts/poa-galley-content.py` renders the galley policy — except there is no second
encoder: the bytes come from the SAME `configJson`/`Manifest.toJson` the admission
seam re-encodes against, so the only thing this driver can do wrong is refuse.

## The ceremony input

The config's `slot_commitment` is `HiddenInstance.commit` of a curator-drawn slot
secret.  The secret arrives as a FILE of 64 lowercase hex digits named by
`POA_NIGHT_WATCH_SECRET_FILE`; it is read, used, and never echoed — no artifact,
report line, or error message renders it.  The driver REFUSES the module's published
rehearsal secret, so the one instance any reader can derive can never back a shipped
artifact.

    umask 077; openssl rand -hex 32 > /path/outside/any/repo/night-watch-slot-1.secret
    POA_NIGHT_WATCH_SECRET_FILE=/path/outside/any/repo/night-watch-slot-1.secret \
      lake env lean --run Dregg2/Games/PathOfAngels/NightWatchCampaignContentEmitMain.lean

⚠ Custody: the secret must survive OUTSIDE every repository — the node's install
ceremony (the `poa_signal_slot_ceremony.rs` shape) will need it to open the
commitment, and a committed secret publishes every schedule of the slot.

## Fail-closed

Before anything is written the driver runs the ENTIRE shipped path over the real
commitment: structural activation, canonical decode round-trip, manifest decode,
`authorizeCampaignConfigForWorld?` against the derived world, `admitActivation?`
over a real draw, a full four-command watch through `replay`, and the exported
`judgeJson` accepting the final debrief.  Any refusal anywhere and no file moves.

## Modes

    emit  (default)             write config.json, manifest.json, world.json
    POA_NIGHT_WATCH_MODE=check  re-derive from the on-disk commitment and refuse on
                                drift — no secret needed, and the rehearsal
                                commitment is refused here too

Output dir: `POA_NIGHT_WATCH_OUT`, default `poa/artifacts/night-watch/epoch-1`
(relative to the working directory — run from the metatheory root's parent or set
the variable absolutely).
