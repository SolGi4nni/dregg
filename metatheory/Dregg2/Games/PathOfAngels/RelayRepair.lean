# Relay Repair — pay a damaged relay's way back onto the grid

Five physical links join the intake `alpha` to the mast `omega` through the beta and
gamma feeds and the shared delta rail, so exactly two source-to-sink routes exist and
both are three links long.  Installing a link spends that link's *cost* out of a
salvage crate, and both are seeded: `boardFromRunSeed` reads the precommitted run
seed and selects one of eight damage boards, each pricing the five links and the
crate.  A run therefore has to read the damage report before it commits.

Two budgets bind and one of them can be spent into a dead end.  `MAX_TURNS` equals
the length of the shortest route, so every install must be on a route the crate can
still pay for; a run that mixes feeds, or that buys a link it cannot follow through
on, reaches a state from which no route completes.  That state is not a trap the
player has to detect: `completableB` is part of `openB`, so a stranded relay refuses
every further action rather than taking more spares for a run it already knows is
dead.  Failure is representable, legible and reachable — `every_board_can_be_lost`.

The canonical state stores the installed links and the turn count only.  Spares and
route availability are projections of the panel against the board, so a drifting
counter cannot exist.
