# Dregg2.Metatheory.CategoricalDescentQueryProtocol

This module isolates the categorical part of a local-query proof protocol from its
cryptographic realization.

The presentation-independent content is a finite coverage presentation: an invalid
family has at least one locally detectable obstruction.  Presentations and exact
changes of presentation form a category.  Obstruction predicates, miss events, and
protocols are natural under its morphisms, including a proved composition law.

The cryptographic content remains explicit and separate:

* `QueryOpeningScheme` and `PointBinding` model commitment/opening binding;
* `AcceptanceReduction` is the algebraic/OOD/low-degree reduction socket;
* `SamplerBound` is the finite transcript/query-sampling term; and
* OOD and low-degree budgets remain independent hypotheses.

Thus the categorical layer does not replace commitments, Fiat--Shamir, polynomials,
or FRI.  It says which local-to-global statement those mechanisms may instantiate.
The final section instantiates the construction to the existing finite patch-code
descent, including its nontrivial weighted-star counterexample.

/-- **PRESENTATION-INDEPENDENT FACTORED SOUNDNESS.**

For an invalid family:

1. the coverage presentation supplies a nonempty local obstruction set;
2. point binding prevents an adaptive opening from rewriting a queried local view;
3. the protocol-specific reduction isolates OOD and low-degree exceptional events; and
4. the sampler bound prices the exact event that every query misses the obstruction.

Only item 1 and the naturality laws are categorical/descent content.  Items 2--4 are
explicit cryptographic/probabilistic parameters. -/
