# Dregg2.Metatheory.FinitePatchCodeDescent — a concrete finite patch-code adapter.

`ProofObjectDescent` supplies exact gluing, while `RobustProofObjectDescent` supplies
finite weighted query machinery.  This file joins those interfaces to an elementary
notion of a finite patch code: each patch carries a local constraint, and a global
codeword is a word whose restriction satisfies every local constraint.

The final section is a completely proved, deliberately small weighted agreement code.
Two singleton patches overlap a two-point hub.  The hub is constrained to be constant;
the tester queries the two hub overlaps with weights one and two.  For every locally
valid submitted family, its rejection weight is *exactly* its weighted block distance
from the constant codeword selected by the hub.  Thus zero rejection reconstructs a
unique codeword, and a one-error family shows the coefficient is sharp.

No expansion, local-testability, HDX, sheaf-code, or IOPP result is imported or claimed.
Those results would be larger concrete instances of the same adapter.
