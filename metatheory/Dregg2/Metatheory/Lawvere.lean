# Dregg2.Metatheory.Lawvere — the LAWVERE HYPERDOCTRINE triple `∃_a ⊣ q_a* ⊣ ∀_a`.

Lawvere (*Adjointness in Foundations*, 1969; *Equality in Hyperdoctrines*, 1970) read
quantifiers as ADJOINTS to the reindexing (substitution) functor `f*`: along `f : α → β`,
existential quantification is its LEFT adjoint `∃_f` and universal quantification its RIGHT
adjoint `∀_f`, giving the celebrated triple

      ∃_f  ⊣  f*  ⊣  ∀_f .

`Metatheory.Disputation` and `project-adjunction-thesis-verdict` (memory) record that the
dregg2 knowledge layer is exactly such a hyperdoctrine: `Predicate ⊣ Witness` is the BASE
tripos, and KNOWLEDGE is a *graded* family of per-agent Lawvere adjunctions `∃_a ⊣ q_a* ⊣ ∀_a`
along the indistinguishability quotient, with `Kₐ = ∀_a`. This module makes that triple
concrete and pins what holds, in TWO clearly-separated parts.

## PART A — the POSETAL Set-doctrine SPECIAL CASE (fully provable).

The fibres are the *power-set posets* `(Set α, ⊆)`; reindexing along `f : α → β` is
`f* = Set.preimage f`. We prove the full triple as `GaloisConnection`s (the posetal /
preorder-enriched shape of an adjunction):

  * `∃_f ⊣ f*`     — `Set.image_preimage : GaloisConnection (image f) (preimage f)`;
  * `f* ⊣ ∀_f`     — `Set.preimage_kernImage : GaloisConnection (preimage f) (kernImage f)`,
                     where `∀_f = Set.kernImage f`;
  * **Frobenius reciprocity** `∃_f (S ∩ f⁻¹ T) = ∃_f S ∩ T` (`Set.image_inter_preimage`);
  * **Beck–Chevalley** (posetal): `g* ∘ ∃_f = ∃_q ∘ p*` for a pullback square — proved from a
    faithful set-level pullback predicate (commuting + surjective comparison onto the fibre
    product), with the `⊇` half free from commuting and the `⊆` half the pullback content.

TEETH (this is the *special* case, and we show its edges):
  * Beck–Chevalley FAILS on a concrete NON-pullback finite (`Fin`) square;
  * a NON-monotone reindexing breaks the Galois connection (concretely on `Fin 2`).

## PART B — the FAITHFUL RELATION-FORM (the deeper, previously-deferred fibre).

The epistemic fibre of `Metatheory.EpistemicConsensus.Frame`: `∀_a = Knows` is a box-modality
over an indistinguishability relation `R` that, for **Byzantine** agents, is REFLEXIVE but NOT
necessarily symmetric or transitive — emphatically NOT an equivalence. We build the relational
quantifiers

  * `relExists R`  (`∃_R`, the relational image / diamond `◇`),
  * `relForall R`  (`∀_R = Knows`, the box `□`),

and prove the genuine general adjunction `∃_R ⊣ ∀_R` that holds for ANY relation; that
reflexivity already yields the modal `T`-axioms; and that the graph of a function recovers
Part A's first adjunction `∃_f ⊣ f*` (so Part B *contains* Part A — it is not a relabeling).

TEETH (why Part B is DIFFERENT from the clean Part-A triple):
  * for an EQUIVALENCE relation the box `∀_R` is IDEMPOTENT (S4 / a quotient interior) — the
    clean situation in which the further right adjoint (the `kernImage`-style closure) exists;
  * for a merely-REFLEXIVE Byzantine relation, `∀_R ∘ ∀_R ≠ ∀_R` (S4 BREAKS) — proved on a
    concrete reflexive-non-transitive `Fin 3` relation; and the diamond `∃_R` FAILS to preserve
    binary meets there. So the clean `kernImage` triple of Part A does NOT lift to the Byzantine
    fibre: that triple was special to the *function/quotient* (equivalence) structure.

The teeth are concrete (`Fin`)
DISCRIMINATING models, so nothing is vacuous.

##################################################################################

The Lawvere hyperdoctrine `Set : αᵒᵖ → Poset`, `α ↦ (Set α, ⊆)`, `f ↦ f* = preimage f`.
Reindexing has BOTH adjoints, and the existential one satisfies Frobenius + Beck–Chevalley.
This is the **special / degenerate fibre**: the base poset is a complete BOOLEAN algebra and
`f*` is a frame homomorphism, which is *exactly* what gives the clean two-sided triple. -/

`g⁻¹(f '' S) = q '' (p⁻¹ S)`. We encode a faithful *set-level pullback square* and prove BC

/-- A concrete COMMUTING-but-NOT-pullback finite square over `Fin _`.

  `A = Fin 2`, `C = Fin 1`, `B = Fin 1`, `P = Fin 1`.
  `f : Fin 2 → Fin 1` is the constant `0`; `g : Fin 1 → Fin 1` is the constant `0`.
  `p : Fin 1 → Fin 2` picks the element `0`; `q : Fin 1 → Fin 1` is the identity.

The square commutes (`f (p x) = 0 = g (q x)`), but it is NOT a pullback: the fibre product
`{(a,c) | f a = g c}` is all of `Fin 2 × Fin 1` (two compatible pairs `(0,0)` and `(1,0)`),
yet the single point of `P` only covers `(0,0)` — the pair `(1,0)` is NOT lifted. Beck–Chevalley
then fails on `S := {1}`: `g⁻¹(f '' {1}) = Fin 1` (everything, since `f '' {1} = {0} = B`), but
`q '' (p⁻¹ {1}) = ∅` (because `p` only hits `0 ∉ {1}`). -/

REFLEXIVE (`indist_refl`) but NOT necessarily symmetric or transitive.

This is the substance that makes Part B *different*, not a relabeling. In Part A, `f*` had BOTH a
left adjoint (`∃_f`) and a right adjoint (`∀_f = kernImage`) because `f*` is a frame homomorphism
(equivalently: the function fibre is a QUOTIENT, an equivalence). The box `relForall R` is an
**interior operator (idempotent, S4)** EXACTLY when `R` is reflexive+transitive — and the genuine
quotient (equivalence) is what underwrites the kernImage closure. We show:

  * for an EQUIVALENCE `R`, `relForall R` is idempotent (`□□T = □T`);
  * for a merely-REFLEXIVE Byzantine `R` (reflexive, NOT transitive), `□□T ≠ □T` — S4 BREAKS;
  * and the diamond `∃_R` FAILS to preserve binary meets there (so no clean frame-hom reindexing,
    hence no clean `kernImage`-style further adjoint).

These are concrete on `Fin 3`. -/

/-- **For an equivalence relation the box is IDEMPOTENT (S4).** If `R` is reflexive and
transitive then `relForall R (relForall R T) = relForall R T` (an interior operator). This is the
CLEAN situation — the one Part A's `kernImage` triple lives in. (Symmetry is not even needed for
idempotence; reflexive+transitive = a *preorder* suffices, which is the S4 frame.) -/

/-- **The diamond `∃_R` FAILS to preserve binary meets for the Byzantine relation.**

For Part A, the right-adjoint `kernImage` exists because `f* = preimage` preserves ALL meets AND
joins (a frame homomorphism). The relational `∃_R` (diamond) is a LEFT adjoint, so it preserves
joins but generally NOT meets. We exhibit `∃_R (S₁ ∩ S₂) ≠ ∃_R S₁ ∩ ∃_R S₂` concretely with
OVERLAPPING images: `S₁ := {0}`, `S₂ := {1}`. Then `∃_R {0} = {0,1}` (successors of `0`) and
`∃_R {1} = {1,2}` (successors of `1`), so their meet is `{1}`. But `S₁ ∩ S₂ = {0} ∩ {1} = ∅`, so
`∃_R (S₁ ∩ S₂) = ∅ ≠ {1}`: the diamond manufactures an element `1` in the meet of the images that
is NOT in the image of the meet. So `∃_R` is not a meet-homomorphism, hence there is no clean

/-! ### §B.5 The de Morgan ◇/□ MATE (`◇ = ¬□¬`), faithfully for ANY relation.

In modal logic the diamond is the de Morgan dual of the box: `◇φ = ¬□¬φ`. The SUBTLETY for a
faithful relational reading is the DIRECTION of `R`. Our `relExists R S = {w | ∃ s, R s w ∧ s ∈ S}`
pushes `S` FORWARD along `R` (predecessors-in-`S`), whereas `relForall R T = {s | ∀ w, R s w → w ∈ T}`
quantifies over `R`-SUCCESSORS. So `(relForall R Sᶜ)ᶜ` is the diamond of the CONVERSE relation, not
of `R` itself. We make this precise: the mate holds with the converse `Rᵒᵖ`, for EVERY relation, and
we show by concrete teeth that the *naive same-`R*` mate `relExists R = (relForall R ·ᶜ)ᶜ` FAILS on a
non-symmetric (Byzantine) relation — so the converse is load-bearing, not cosmetic. -/

The hyperdoctrine projection formula in Part A was the EQUALITY `∃_f(S ∩ f*T) = ∃_f S ∩ T`, available

`relExists R (S ∩ relForall R T) = relExists R S ∩ T` FAILS (non-functional `R`). What holds
— and is the honest relational Frobenius / projection LAX law — is the `⊆` half, valid for EVERY `R`:

      relExists R (S ∩ relForall R T) ⊆ relExists R S ∩ T.

We prove it, prove that on a SURJECTIVE-image / functional structure the reverse also holds
(recovering the Part-A equality via the graph), and add teeth showing the reverse — hence the naive
posetal equality — FAILS on the Byzantine relation. -/

/-! ### §B.7 Relational composition functoriality / Beck–Chevalley.

`relExists` is a (covariant) FUNCTOR from the category of relations (under composition) to
endomaps of `Set Ω`, and `relForall` is the corresponding CONTRAVARIANT functor (it reverses
composition). With `relComp R S` meaning "apply `S`, then `R`" (function-composition order,
`(R∘S) a c := ∃ b, S a b ∧ R b c`):

  * `relExists (R ∘ S) = relExists R ∘ relExists S`   (∃ is functorial / covariant in the relation);
  * `relForall (R ∘ S) = relForall S ∘ relForall R`   (□ reverses composition / is contravariant).

These are the relational Beck–Chevalley / functoriality coherences. They hold for ANY relations,
with no pullback hypothesis — composition of relations is total, so the relational fibre satisfies
the coherence UNCONDITIONALLY (contrast Part A, where Beck–Chevalley needed a genuine pullback). -/
