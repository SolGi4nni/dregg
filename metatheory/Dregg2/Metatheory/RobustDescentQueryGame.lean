# Dregg2.Metatheory.RobustDescentQueryGame -- robust descent meets hidden local queries.

`RobustProofObjectDescent` identifies the finite set of overlap queries on which a submitted
family fails to glue.  This module supplies the next, deliberately probabilistic bridge:

* failure of global amalgamation gives a nonempty finite obstruction set;
* `k` hidden, independent, uniform queries miss a bad set `B` in exactly
  `(|Q| - |B|)^k` cases out of `|Q|^k`;
* a commitment is fixed before those queries are sampled;
* even a query-adaptive responder cannot replace an obstructed local view after seeing the query,
  provided the opening relation is point-binding; and
* consequently accepted samples are a subset of the exact miss set.

This is not deterministic total-object extraction.  In particular it does not contradict the
counterexamples in `FriColumnLogExtractHonest`: an invalid committed object can be accepted whenever
all sampled queries miss its obstruction set.  The theorem prices precisely that event.  Concrete
Merkle/FRI deployments must instantiate `PointBinding` with their computational binding game and
must establish that their verifier's local rejection predicate exposes the chosen obstruction set.
