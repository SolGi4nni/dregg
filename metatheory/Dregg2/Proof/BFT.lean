`World.lean` delivers the two BFT obligations only weakly:
  * O1: `quorum_intersection_safety` proves the bare pigeonhole (two quorums share a voter),
    without the adversary/honesty model needed to turn that shared voter into a contradiction.
  * O2: `liveness_after_gst` assumes `World.gst_liveness` as an oracle field.

This file adds the adversary/honesty model as an explicit structure (`BFTModel`) and proves:

  * **O1 STRONG (`bft_safety`)**: under `n > 3f`, ≤ `f` Byzantine voters, the `n − f` quorum
    threshold, and honest-vote-once, two quorums for conflicting blocks are a contradiction.
    (Li–Lesani / Malkhi–Reiter quorum-intersection-at-an-honest-process.)
  * **O2 reduced (`gst_liveness_from_round_model`)**: the `World.gst_liveness` conclusion is
    derived from a DLS88 GST round structure + HotStuff-style honest-leader delivery hypothesis
    — reducing the oracle assumption to "honest votes are delivered within Δ after GST".

OPEN (O2 residual): a from-scratch proof that a `GSTRound` eventually obtains (pacemaker /
view-synchrony); see the `OPEN` block in §4. This is left as a named obstruction, not a sorry.

All adversary assumptions are structure fields.

/-! ## 1. The adversary / honesty model (layered over `World`).

Following the `velisarios` / `zotero-formal-verification-blockchain-bft` mechanization
template, the adversary is a `Byzantine : Nat → Prop` predicate on voter ids together with the
quorum-systems *consistency* discipline (Li–Lesani Def. 3): a `≤ f` fault bound, `n > 3f`, and
the honest-vote-once law. None of these are axioms — they are the fields of a `structure`
parameterized by a `Finality.Config`, so any theorem consuming them stays kernel-clean. -/

/-- **The Byzantine / honesty model over a `Finality.Config`.** A `BFTModel cfg votes` bundles
the adversary structure the strong BFT-safety theorem needs, as explicit fields (the honest
`recv_mono`-style discipline, never `axiom`s):

* `Byzantine` / `byzantineDec` — which voter ids are corrupt (decidable, so we can `filter`).
* `fault_bound` — at most `cfg.f` voters are Byzantine *among those that actually voted* (the
  union of the two blocks' voter sets). This is the `≤ f` adversary budget; restricting it to
  actual voters is the honest, non-vacuous statement (we never need a global population finset).
* `bft_threshold` — `cfg.n > 3 * cfg.f`: the classical `n = 3f+1` BFT floor that makes the
  `n − f` quorum intersect in `> f` processes (so the honest-witness survives `f` faults).
* `population_bound` — every distinct voter is one of the `cfg.n` participants, so the union of
  any two blocks' voter sets has card `≤ cfg.n` (the membership bound `World`'s pigeonhole also
  took, here as a model field rather than a bare hypothesis).
* `honest_vote_once` — **the honesty law**: a non-Byzantine voter does not endorse two distinct
  blocks (it votes at most once per height). This is the per-node voting discipline that lives
  with the protocol, not the network oracle; it is exactly what `World.quorum_intersection_safety`
  scoped out as "needs the adversary/honesty model". -/

/-! ## 2. O1 STRONG — the full BFT safety theorem.

Two stages, exactly the Malkhi–Reiter / Li–Lesani argument:

1. **Honest-witness intersection** (`honest_witness_in_intersection`): under the `n − f` BFT
   quorum and `n > 3f`, the intersection `Q₁ ∩ Q₂` has more than `f` members; purging the
   ≤ `f` Byzantine ones leaves a non-empty honest remainder ⇒ an **honest** voter in both
   quorums. This is *quorum intersection at a well-behaved process* (Li–Lesani Def. 3).
2. **The contradiction** (`bft_safety`): that honest witness voted for both `b₁` and `b₂`;
   honest-vote-once forces `b₁ = b₂`, contradicting `b₁ ≠ b₂`. -/

/-- **Honest-witness quorum intersection (PROVED).** The strong form of
`World.quorum_intersection_safety`: under the model's `n > 3f` + `≤ f` Byzantine + the BFT
quorum threshold `n − f` (each block reached `n − f` distinct voters), the two quorums share a
voter that is **honest** (`¬ Byzantine`). This is the quorum-systems *consistency* property:
"every pair of quorums intersect at a well-behaved process" (Li–Lesani Def. 3 /
Malkhi–Reiter). Counting: `|Q₁ ∩ Q₂| = |Q₁| + |Q₂| − |Q₁ ∪ Q₂| ≥ 2(n−f) − n = n − 2f > f`
(since `n > 3f`), and the Byzantine voters in the intersection number `≤ f`, so the honest
remainder is non-empty. -/

/-! ## 4. O2 — GST / partial-synchrony liveness: the modeled round structure.

`World.gst_liveness` is an *assumed oracle field* whose conclusion is "∃ a round meeting the
threshold". We **reduce** what is assumed: we model the DLS88 GST round structure + a
HotStuff-style honest-leader synchronized view as explicit hypotheses, and PROVE that the
quorum-forming conclusion follows from them. This turns "assume a round meets threshold" into
"assume after GST honest votes are *delivered* within Δ and the honest set is a supermajority"
— a strictly weaker, FLP-respecting input (the full conclusion is now derived, not assumed).

The model (DLS88 §1: after GST, delay ≤ Δ; HotStuff §"Optimistic Responsiveness": after GST a
synchronized view with an honest leader collects votes responsively):

* `GSTRound` — a round `r` that occurs after GST, in which a synchronized honest view's votes
  for `block` are *delivered* (the DLS88 Δ-delivery bound made concrete: the honest voters'
  endorsements appear in `votesOf (World.recv r)`).
* the honest set is a supermajority of size `≥ cfg.threshold`.

We prove: such a round reaches the quorum threshold. This is the *responsive* liveness step
HotStuff isolates — given delivery, the count is immediate. -/

/-- **A modeled post-GST round (the DLS88 + HotStuff hypothesis bundle).** `GSTRound votesOf
cfg block r` says round `r` is one where the partial-synchrony model's good event holds: the
distinct honest voters for `block` whose votes are delivered by round `r` number at least
`cfg.threshold`. This is the *concrete* form of "after GST, an honest supermajority's votes
arrive within Δ" — DLS88's Δ-delivery bound (§1) instantiated at a HotStuff synchronized view
with an honest leader (§"Optimistic Responsiveness"). It is a HYPOTHESIS (a `def` consumed as a
premise), not an assumed `World` field: the point is to derive the quorum, not assume it. -/
def GSTRound [World Msg] (votesOf : List Msg → List Vote)
    (cfg : Finality.Config) (block : Nat) (r : Nat) : Prop :=
  cfg.threshold ≤ (votersFor (votesOf (World.recv r)) block).length

/-- **O2 (reduced-assumption form)**: if a `GSTRound` holds at round `r` — i.e. after GST a
synchronized honest supermajority's votes are delivered (DLS88 Δ-bound + HotStuff responsive view)
— then `block` is `committedByQuorum` at `r`. Derives the `World.gst_liveness` conclusion from the
weaker delivery hypothesis "honest votes are delivered within Δ after GST". -/

  show committedByQuorum votesOf r cfg block
  unfold committedByQuorum
  simp only [quorumReached, decide_eq_true_eq]

/-- **O2 existential form**: if a `GSTRound` exists, the block is committed at some round —

    ∃ r, committedByQuorum votesOf r cfg block := by
  obtain ⟨r, hr⟩ := hgst
  exact ⟨r, gst_liveness_from_round_model votesOf cfg block hr⟩

/-- **Bridge to the oracle**: the modeled premise is implied by `World.gst_liveness`'s productivity
field `hprod` (voter count grows without bound) — the reduction is sound, not a strengthening. -/

    ∃ r, GSTRound votesOf cfg block r := by
  obtain ⟨r, hr⟩ := hprod cfg.threshold
  exact ⟨r, hr⟩

/-
OPEN (O2 residual, not a sorry): a from-scratch proof that a `GSTRound` eventually obtains —
the pacemaker / view-synchronization argument. Requires: (i) relating `World.clock` to Δ-bounded
delivery; (ii) a modeled view automaton with leader rotation and timeouts; (iii) the FLP-respecting
argument that an honest leader is eventually hit. `World.gst_liveness` remains the assumed oracle
law; this file reduces its premise to Δ-delivery (not the full conclusion).
