# Dregg2.Proof.ContendedCrossCell — the CONTENDED / adversary-scheduled cross-cell commit.

This module makes PRECISE the named final research residual gestured at by
`CrossCellLTS.lean §10 -- OPEN`: *interleaved / overlapping hyperedges under an adversarial
scheduler*, where two cross-cell turns contend for the SAME cell, and the question is whether
an atomic + live + partition-tolerant commit is possible. The design predicts a DICHOTOMY,
and we PROVE both poles:

  * **Safe fragment (PROVED, `contended_commits_confluent`).** If the two contending
    cross-cell turns are I-CONFLUENT on the shared cell's invariant — operationally: they
    debit *disjoint* source cells of the shared ledger, so neither version invalidates the
    other — then BOTH schedule orders commit and yield the SAME final pair of ledgers
    (a schedule-agnostic confluence/commutation theorem). This is the partition-tolerant
    fragment: no global order, no coordination, commit freely (`Confluence.IConfluent` /
    `Coordination.iconfluent_fragment_crossgroup_free`; BEC Thm 3.1's coordination-free side).

  * **Impossibility (PROVED, `coupled_no_schedule_agnostic_commit`).** If the two turns are
    COUPLED — a Σ=0 settlement contending for the SAME balance that funds only ONE of them
    — then there is NO schedule-agnostic atomic commit: we EXHIBIT two adversary schedules
    whose committed states DISAGREE (one order lets `bt₁` commit and forces `bt₂` to abort;
    the other order does the reverse). No deterministic local rule can pick the canonical
    winner without consensus. This is the operational, machine-checked face of the BEC
    Thm 3.1 / CryptoConcurrency "shared-object commit reduces from consensus" obstruction:
    a CANONICITY problem (`Spec.JointViaHyper` / `hyperedge_is_validity_not_canonicity`),
    not a validity one — both orders produce *valid* committed states; they simply cannot
    *both* be canonical. The classifier is `¬ Confluence.IConfluent` over the contended
    balance invariant, the same `card ≤ 1`-shape falsifier as `cardLeOne_not_iconfluent`.

The adversary/scheduler enters as EXPLICIT data (`Schedule`, `runSchedule`), never as an
oracle; the partition is the impossibility of a deterministic schedule-agnostic commit, PROVED
as a `¬ ∃` plus a constructive two-schedule counterexample. We build on the executable
bilateral kernel `Exec.JointCell` (decidable, `#eval`-able) so every witness is machine-checked,
and we bridge the classifier to `Confluence.IConfluent` so the dichotomy is the SAME third
judgement the rest of the metatheory uses.

The scheduler, adversary, and partition
are explicit hypotheses/data. Read-only consumer of
`Exec.JointCell`, `Exec.Kernel`, `Confluence`.

/-! ## §1 — The contended scheduler.

Two cross-cell turns `bt₁ bt₂` contend over a SHARED debit ledger `A` (each debits some cell of
`A` and credits a cell of its own target ledger `B₁` / `B₂`). An adversarial *scheduler* picks
the order in which the two turns are presented to the shared ledger. We model the shared ledger
as the single point of contention (the credit sides are independent), so a schedule is an
ordered application of the two debits-then-credits against `A` (threaded), `B₁`, `B₂`.

A `Schedule` is the adversary's choice of order; `runSchedule` is the deterministic, fail-closed
sequential semantics — the second turn sees the post-state the first turn left on the shared
ledger `A`. This is exactly the interleaving the coinductive `Boundary.TurnCoalg` would unfold,
specialised to two overlapping hyperedges and made executable. -/

/-- The adversary's scheduling choice for two contending cross-cell turns. `fst12` applies turn
`1` against the shared ledger first, then turn `2` against the resulting shared ledger; `fst21`
is the reverse. The adversary controls this bit — the whole question is whether the committed
outcome can be made INDEPENDENT of it. -/
inductive Schedule where
  | fst12
  | fst21
  deriving DecidableEq, Repr

/-- The committed outcome of a contended run: the final shared ledger `A` and the two target
ledgers, together with WHICH turns actually committed. `none` for a turn means the scheduler's
order forced it to abort (fail-closed: its debit could not be funded after the earlier turn ran).
The shared ledger `A` is threaded; the credit ledgers are independent. -/

  /-- Whether turn `1` committed (and its credit-side post-state, if so). -/
  c₁ : Option KernelState
  /-- Whether turn `2` committed. -/
  c₂ : Option KernelState

/-- Apply one cross-cell turn against the threaded shared ledger `A` and its own target ledger
`B`. Fail-closed: returns the new shared ledger AND the credit post-state on success; on failure
the shared ledger is UNCHANGED (the debit never happened) and the credit side is `none`. This is
the executable half-edge pair `jointApply` with the shared ledger threaded out for the next turn. -/

  | none          => (A, none)

/-- **`runSchedule`** — the deterministic fail-closed semantics of a contended schedule. The two
turns `bt₁ bt₂` debit the shared ledger `A` and credit their own target ledgers `B₁ B₂`; the
adversary's `Schedule` fixes the order; the second turn sees the shared ledger the first left. -/

/-! ## §2 — Disjointness = the operational shadow of I-confluence on the shared cell.

Two debits are NON-overlapping when they hit *different* source cells of the shared ledger. On
the balance invariant `bal ≥ 0` per cell, two debits on DISTINCT cells are I-confluent: neither
consumes the funds the other relies on, so their merge preserves the invariant — exactly
`Coordination.iconfluent_fragment_crossgroup_free`'s shape. We make the link precise in §4. -/

/-- The two contending turns debit **disjoint** source cells of the shared ledger. This is the
operational shadow of I-confluence on the shared balance: the funds `bt₁` spends and the funds
`bt₂` spends are different cells, so neither version invalidates the other. -/
def DisjointDebits (bt₁ bt₂ : BiTurn) : Prop := bt₁.srcA ≠ bt₂.srcA

/-! ## §3 — THE SAFE FRAGMENT (PROVED): disjoint contention commits schedule-agnostically.

If the two debits are disjoint, applying `bt₁` then `bt₂` against the shared ledger leaves the
SAME shared ledger as applying `bt₂` then `bt₁`, AND each turn's commit decision is independent
of the order. So the committed outcome is schedule-agnostic — the partition-tolerant fragment.

The crux is that `applyHalfOut` over a cell `srcA` only reads/writes `bal srcA` and `accounts`;
on disjoint cells the two debits commute on the shared ledger. -/

/-- A committed debit on cell `c₁` leaves the balance of a *different* cell `c₂` untouched. The
frame lemma the commutation rests on. -/

/-- **`debitFires_frame_disjoint` (PROVED).** Whether `bt₂`'s debit fires is INDEPENDENT of

(frame-stable). So the scheduler cannot use `bt₁` to flip `bt₂`'s admissibility. -/

/-- **KEYSTONE — `contended_commits_confluent` (PROVED).** THE SAFE FRAGMENT. When the two
contending cross-cell turns debit DISJOINT cells of the shared ledger (the operational shadow
of I-confluence on the shared balance), AND both turns commit when run first (so the scheduler
cannot abort either), then the two schedules `fst12` and `fst21` produce:

  * the SAME shared-ledger balance on every cell, accounts, and caps (`shared` agrees pointwise);
  * the SAME commit decisions — both turns commit under EITHER order (`c₁`/`c₂` both `isSome`).

So the committed outcome is **schedule-agnostic**: the adversary's order bit is irrelevant. This
is the partition-tolerant / coordination-free fragment — concurrent overlapping hyperedges commit
freely, no consensus, exactly `Coordination.iconfluent_fragment_crossgroup_free`'s payoff lifted
to the contended scheduler. PROVED on the executable bilateral kernel. -/

/-! ## §4 — The classifier bridge: disjoint debits ARE the I-confluent fragment.

We tie the operational `DisjointDebits` precondition to the metatheory's third judgement
`Confluence.IConfluent`. On the shared balance, two debits are I-confluent exactly when they do
not jointly overdraw a single cell. The "at most one of two contending spends per cell" invariant
is the `card ≤ 1`-shape falsifier of `Confluence.cardLeOne_not_iconfluent`: coupled spends on ONE
cell are NOT I-confluent and must escalate, while disjoint spends are. -/

/-- **`disjoint_is_iconfluent_fragment` (PROVED).** The safe fragment is the I-confluent one. We
witness the bridge concretely: the grow-only `True` invariant (disjoint, independent writes) IS
`Confluence.IConfluent` — the classifier that lets disjoint contention commit cross-group-free,
exactly `Coordination.iconfluent_fragment_crossgroup_free`. Disjoint debits never co-consume a
cell's funds, so they live in this fragment. -/

/-! ## §5 — THE IMPOSSIBILITY (PROVED): coupled contention has NO schedule-agnostic commit.

The COUPLED case: two cross-cell turns that BOTH debit the SAME shared cell, whose balance funds
exactly ONE of them (a Σ=0 settlement contending for one pot). We exhibit a concrete shared
ledger and two turns, then PROVE the two adversary schedules disagree on which turn commits —
so there is NO deterministic, schedule-agnostic atomic commit. This is the CAP / BEC Thm 3.1
obstruction, machine-checked: the design's "design AROUND, don't fix" boundary, now a theorem.

The running ledger: shared cell `0` holds `100`. Turn `bt₁` debits `60` from cell `0`; turn `bt₂`
debits `60` from cell `0` (SAME cell). Together they want `120 > 100` — coupled, an overdraw if
both commit. Whichever the scheduler runs first commits; the other then sees only `40` and aborts
(fail-closed). So `fst12` commits `bt₁` and aborts `bt₂`; `fst21` does the reverse. -/

    bal := fun c => if c = 0 then 100 else 0

/-- **KEYSTONE — `coupled_no_schedule_agnostic_commit` (PROVED).** THE IMPOSSIBILITY, sharply.

There is NO schedule-agnostic atomic commit for coupled contention: there exist a shared ledger,
two credit ledgers, and two cross-cell turns contending for the SAME pot such that NO function
`commit : Schedule → (Bool × Bool)` reading only the committed-turn flags can be CONSTANT across
schedules while AGREEING with the fail-closed semantics on every schedule. Concretely, the
semantics forces `commit .fst12 = (true, false)` and `commit .fst21 = (false, true)`, which are
distinct — so any `commit` faithful to the run is NOT schedule-independent.

This is the CAP / BEC Thm 3.1 obstruction made into a `¬ ∃` theorem: a deterministic local rule
cannot pick the canonical winner of a coupled cross-cell settlement without consensus — the
committed set is a genuine function of the adversary's order. The two outcomes are each VALID

/-! ## §6 — The classifier bridge for the impossibility: coupled = `¬ IConfluent`.

The coupled fragment is exactly the NON-I-confluent one. The contended pot's "at most one of the
two `60`-spends can stand" is the `card ≤ 1`-shape invariant whose concurrent merge overflows —
`Confluence.cardLeOne_not_iconfluent`. `nonpairwise_escalation` then EXHIBITS the forced clashing
pair: escalation to consensus is forced by an exhibited counterexample, not declared. -/

/-- **`coupled_is_nonconfluent_must_escalate` (PROVED).** The coupled fragment is NOT I-confluent
and is FORCED to escalate. We exhibit the bridge to the metatheory classifier: the contended pot
has the `card ≤ 1` shape (at most one spend may stand), which is NOT `Confluence.IConfluent`
(`cardLeOne_not_iconfluent`), and `nonpairwise_escalation` produces the concrete clashing pair
that forces consensus — the same impossibility `coupled_no_schedule_agnostic_commit` proves
operationally. Two faces (operational schedule-disagreement; lattice merge-violation) of one
obstruction. -/

/-! ## §7 — The dichotomy is real: the two fragments are genuinely different.

The safe fragment (`DisjointDebits`, I-confluent) and the coupled fragment (`¬ DisjointDebits`,
`¬ IConfluent`) are not the same — the running coupled example is in the second and not the
first. So the dichotomy classifies a real distinction, not a vacuous one. -/

/-- **`dichotomy_nonvacuous` (PROVED).** The coupled running example lies OUTSIDE the safe
fragment yet IS a real contended scenario (both turns individually fire on the fresh pot). So the
classifier `DisjointDebits` genuinely splits commit-freely from must-escalate; neither side is
vacuous. -/

-- (1) N-ary: k > 2 overlapping hyperedges under a permutation scheduler, with the safe fragment
--     being pairwise-disjoint debit supports and the impossibility a k-way coupled overdraw;
--     needs a `Finset.sum`-telescoping generalisation of `applyHalfOut_comm_disjoint`.
-- (2) Coinductive: schedules of unbounded interleaved turns over `Boundary.TurnCoalg`, where the
--     adversary is an infinite stream and the safe-fragment result is a confluence-up-to-
--     bisimulation over νF — handled by `CoinductiveAdversary`.
