# Dregg2.Proof.CordialMinersLiveness — closing the MECHANICAL/MODERATE liveness residual of
# the Cordial-Miners DAG-BFT consensus, ADDITIVELY, with the genuinely-hard pacemaker /
# dissemination cores left as explicitly-NAMED residual statements (never faked, never `sorry`).

`Dregg2.Proof.CordialMiners` proves the **safety** keystone (`cordial_agreement` /
`cordial_agreement_from_lace`: a wave anchors at most one super-ratified leader) by transferring
the classical `n > 3f` quorum-intersection core onto the leaderless DAG commit rule dregg1 runs
(`ordering.rs`). It left four named `OPEN`s. This module closes the two MECHANICAL ones additively
— it does NOT touch the existing module's `#assert_axioms` pins — and gives the two HARD ones
(the post-GST pacemaker / dissemination convergence) crisp residual *definitions/hypotheses* so the
frontier is a named, type-checked object rather than prose.

## What is CLOSED here (additive theorems, kernel-clean)

  1. **OPEN-CM-XSORT — the deterministic intra-segment total order (`ordering.rs::xsort`).**
     `ordering.rs` orders the blocks *within* a super-ratified segment deterministically, tie-broken
     by block id. We implement that tie-break as `Block.xleq` (compare by the `BlockId` `Nat`),
     prove `xsort_consistency` — it is **reflexive, transitive, and total** over an arbitrary
     segment (a `List Block`), i.e. a genuine total preorder — and define `Block.xsort` (the
     deterministic sort). We then prove `xsort_sorted` (the output is `xleq`-`Pairwise`),
     `xsort_perm`/`xsort_length` (it permutes the segment, losing nothing), `xsort_idem`
     (determinism: re-sorting is a no-op), and `xsort_segment_total_order` (the output is a
     **linear extension**: any two distinct segment blocks are strictly comparable by id). This is
     the within-segment determinism `cordial_agreement` deliberately scoped out — now a theorem.

  2. **`cordial_agreement_from_single_lace` — the BFT-quorum model is consumed on the REAL
     `Authority.Blocklace.Lace`.** `cordial_agreement_from_lace` already takes both commit facts as
     reads of *one* `CordialState.lace` (a `Blocklace.Lace`). We confirm that by deriving the
     single-lace specialization: two leaders both `Committed` *in the same `CordialState` `S`* (so
     their ratifier quorums are both read off `S.lace` via `ratifyingVoters`) cannot be distinct,
     under the honest BFT model over the materialized ratification votes. The quorum-intersection
     core is the same `BFT.honest_witness_in_intersection`; the point of the specialization is that
     BOTH quorums are now manifestly facts about a *single* concrete blocklace.

## What stays OPEN — named residual objects, NOT sorries

  3. **`HonestRatifierConvergence` — the dissemination residual (post-GST).** The genuinely-hard
     liveness/dissemination core (`dissemination.rs` reliable broadcast + the post-GST pacemaker):
     after GST, on the *union* of two laces the honest nodes' causal pasts have converged enough
     that a shared honest ratifier of one leader is visible as a ratifier of the other. We give it
     as an explicit `structure` field bundle (`HonestRatifierConvergence`) — exactly the shape the
     safety argument *consumes* — and prove `agreement_of_convergence`: GIVEN the convergence
     witness, the two leaders collapse. So the residual is a typed hypothesis the runtime discharges
     (like `World.recv_mono` / `BeaconSpace.indep_block`), not a hole.

     The pacemaker progress itself (a wave EVENTUALLY super-ratifies) remains the
     `[hard] OPEN-CM-LIVENESS` / `[hard] O2-pacemaker` residual — the SAME obstruction as
     `BFT.lean`'s O2 and `BeaconSpace`'s honest-leader hit. We RE-EXPORT the BeaconSpace discharge
     of exactly that residual (`liveness_over_beacon`) so the named obstruction is connected to its
     existing partial discharge rather than restated. We never fake it; `cm_pacemaker_residual`
     is a `Prop`-valued *named statement*, accompanied by the honest note that its from-scratch
     proof is the view-synchrony argument off the safety critical path.

**Rails.** No `sorry`/`admit`/`axiom`/`native_decide`. Every adversary/dissemination assumption is a
`structure` field or theorem hypothesis. Keystones are `#assert_axioms`-clean. Builds on the
existing modules by `import` only; defines nothing already taken (`xleq`/`xsort`/… are new names in
`namespace`s under `Dregg2.Proof.CordialMiners`).

/-! ## 1. OPEN-CM-XSORT closed: the deterministic intra-segment total order.

`ordering.rs::xsort` deterministically orders the blocks *within* a super-ratified segment, tie-
broken by block id so two honest nodes computing `tau` over the same segment agree on the order.
We implement that tie-break and prove the three consistency laws the task names — reflexive,
transitive, total — over an arbitrary segment, then build the sort and prove it is a genuine
linear extension (sorted + a permutation of the segment + idempotent). -/

/-- **`Block.xleq a b`** (`ordering.rs::xsort`'s comparison key): order blocks by their content-
address `BlockId` (a `Nat`), the deterministic tie-break. `xleq a b ↔ a.id ≤ b.id`. Because the id
is the §8 content-address, this is the canonical deterministic order two honest nodes both compute. -/
def Block.xleq (a b : Block) : Prop := a.id ≤ b.id

instance : DecidableRel Block.xleq := fun a b => inferInstanceAs (Decidable (a.id ≤ b.id))

/-! ### 1a. `xsort_consistency`: reflexive, transitive, total over a segment.

These are the three laws the task asks for. Stated *over a segment* `seg : List Block` (the
super-ratified segment `xsort` orders) — though `xleq` is in fact a total preorder on ALL blocks,
which is exactly why the order is deterministic across nodes. -/

/-- **`xleq` is REFLEXIVE.** Every block is `xleq` itself (`a.id ≤ a.id`). -/
theorem Block.xleq_refl (a : Block) : Block.xleq a a := le_refl a.id

/-- **`xleq` is TRANSITIVE.** `xleq a b → xleq b c → xleq a c` (transitivity of `≤` on ids). -/
theorem Block.xleq_trans {a b c : Block} (hab : Block.xleq a b) (hbc : Block.xleq b c) :
    Block.xleq a c := le_trans hab hbc

/-- **`xleq` is TOTAL.** For any two blocks, `xleq a b ∨ xleq b a` (`Nat` linear order on ids). -/
theorem Block.xleq_total (a b : Block) : Block.xleq a b ∨ Block.xleq b a := le_total a.id b.id

/-- **`xleq` is ANTISYMMETRIC up to id** (`xleq a b → xleq b a → a.id = b.id`): the only ambiguity
the tie-break leaves is between blocks sharing an id, which on a canonical lace are equal. -/
theorem Block.xleq_antisymm_id {a b : Block} (hab : Block.xleq a b) (hba : Block.xleq b a) :
    a.id = b.id := le_antisymm hab hba

/-- **`xsort_consistency` (PROVED — the law the task names).** The deterministic tie-break `xleq`
is a genuine total preorder over any segment `seg`: reflexive, transitive, and total on the segment's
blocks. This is what makes `ordering.rs::xsort` deterministic — two honest nodes computing it over
the same segment get the same order. Packaged as one statement over an explicit segment. -/
theorem xsort_consistency (seg : List Block) :
    (∀ a ∈ seg, Block.xleq a a) ∧
    (∀ a ∈ seg, ∀ b ∈ seg, ∀ c ∈ seg, Block.xleq a b → Block.xleq b c → Block.xleq a c) ∧
    (∀ a ∈ seg, ∀ b ∈ seg, Block.xleq a b ∨ Block.xleq b a) :=
  ⟨fun a _ => Block.xleq_refl a,
   fun _ _ _ _ _ _ hab hbc => Block.xleq_trans hab hbc,
   fun a _ b _ => Block.xleq_total a b⟩

-- the typeclass facts `pairwise_insertionSort` needs (total + transitive) for `xleq`.
instance : Std.Total Block.xleq := ⟨Block.xleq_total⟩
instance : IsTrans Block Block.xleq := ⟨fun _ _ _ => Block.xleq_trans⟩

/-! ### 1b. `xsort`: the deterministic sort and its linear-extension properties. -/

/-- **`Block.xsort seg`** (`ordering.rs::xsort`): the deterministic ordering of a segment, sorting
by block id via insertion sort over `xleq`. The within-segment total order `cordial_agreement`
scoped out — now a concrete function. -/
def Block.xsort (seg : List Block) : List Block := seg.insertionSort Block.xleq

/-- **`xsort_sorted` (PROVED)** — the output is `xleq`-`Pairwise` (sorted by id): consecutive blocks
are id-ordered. Uses `List.pairwise_insertionSort` with the `Std.Total`/`IsTrans` instances. -/
theorem xsort_sorted (seg : List Block) : (Block.xsort seg).Pairwise Block.xleq :=
  List.pairwise_insertionSort Block.xleq seg

/-- **`xsort_perm` (PROVED)** — `xsort` only *reorders*: it is a permutation of the segment, so the
total order loses no block and invents none (the `tau` segment is exactly the super-ratified blocks,
reordered). -/
theorem xsort_perm (seg : List Block) : List.Perm (Block.xsort seg) seg :=
  List.perm_insertionSort Block.xleq seg

/-- **`xsort_length` (PROVED)** — `xsort` preserves length (corollary of `xsort_perm`). -/
theorem xsort_length (seg : List Block) : (Block.xsort seg).length = seg.length :=
  (xsort_perm seg).length_eq

/-- **`xsort_mem` (PROVED)** — membership is preserved both ways: a block is in the sorted segment
iff it was in the segment. -/
theorem xsort_mem {b : Block} {seg : List Block} : b ∈ Block.xsort seg ↔ b ∈ seg :=
  (xsort_perm seg).mem_iff

/-- **`xsort_idem` (PROVED — DETERMINISM).** Re-sorting an already-sorted segment is a no-op:
`xsort (xsort seg) = xsort seg`. This is the determinism property — `tau` is a fixpoint of `xsort`,
so the order is stable and node-independent. Proved from `Pairwise.insertionSort_eq` (a list already
`Pairwise r` is unchanged by `insertionSort r`). -/
theorem xsort_idem (seg : List Block) : Block.xsort (Block.xsort seg) = Block.xsort seg :=
  (xsort_sorted seg).insertionSort_eq

/-- **`xsort_segment_total_order` (PROVED — the linear-extension keystone).** On a *canonical*
segment (distinct blocks have distinct ids — the content-addressing invariant, exactly
`Lace.Canonical` restricted to the segment), `xsort` realizes a genuine **linear order**: any two
DISTINCT blocks of the segment are *strictly* id-comparable (`a.id < b.id ∨ b.id < a.id`), and the
sorted output puts them in that strict order. So `tau` is a total order on the segment, not merely a
preorder — the deterministic within-segment ranking `ordering.rs::xsort` guarantees. This closes
OPEN-CM-XSORT's *totality/determinism* obligation as a theorem. -/
theorem xsort_segment_total_order (seg : List Block)
    (hcanon : ∀ a ∈ seg, ∀ b ∈ seg, a.id = b.id → a = b)
    {a b : Block} (ha : a ∈ seg) (hb : b ∈ seg) (hne : a ≠ b) :

/-! ## 2. `cordial_agreement_from_single_lace`: the BFT quorum model on the REAL `Lace`.

`cordial_agreement_from_lace` (in `CordialMiners`) already consumes the BFT quorum model on the real
`Authority.Blocklace.Lace`: both `Committed S cfg lᵢ` hypotheses are reads of the *one*
`CordialState.lace : Lace` via `ratifyingVoters` (the `HasApprovingBlock` filter over the actual
blocks). The single-lace specialization makes that manifest — both quorums are facts about ONE
concrete blocklace `S.lace`, not two abstract vote sets. -/

/-- **`cordial_agreement_from_single_lace` (PROVED) — agreement with BOTH quorums read off ONE
blocklace.** Two leaders `l₁ l₂` both `Committed` in the *same* `CordialState S` — i.e. the *single*
blocklace `S.lace` exhibits an `≥ n-f` `ratifyingVoters` read for *each* — cannot be distinct, under
the honest BFT model over the materialized (lace-derived) ratification votes plus id-determinism.
This is the audit's target sharpened: the quorum-intersection safety core is consumed on the actual
`Authority.Blocklace.Lace` `S.lace`, with both ratifier counts being `(ratifyingVoters …).length`
over that single DAG. A thin specialization of `cordial_agreement_from_lace` (same proof term),
recorded to confirm the single-lace shape. -/
theorem cordial_agreement_from_single_lace
    (S : CordialState) (cfg : Finality.Config) (l₁ l₂ : Block)
    -- BOTH commit facts are reads of the SAME `S.lace : Authority.Blocklace.Lace`:

    (hid_inj : l₁.id = l₂.id → l₁ = l₂) :
    l₁ = l₂ :=
  cordial_agreement_from_lace S cfg l₁ l₂ h₁ h₂ M hid_inj

/-- **`cordial_no_conflicting_final_leaders_from_single_lace` (PROVED) — the `False`/safety form on
ONE lace.** Two *distinct* blocks cannot both be `Committed` in the same `CordialState` (both exhibit
an `≥ n-f` `ratifyingVoters` read off the *single* `S.lace`) under the honest model. -/

/-! ## 3. The dissemination residual, NAMED: `HonestRatifierConvergence` (post-GST).

The genuinely-hard liveness/dissemination core. `cordial_agreement_from_lace`'s OPEN-CM-DISSEMINATION
residual item (3) is: after GST, on the *union* of two laces the honest nodes' causal pasts have
converged enough that a shared honest ratifier of one leader is visible as a ratifier of the other
(the `dissemination.rs` reliable-broadcast guarantee). We give it as an explicit `structure` — the
exact shape the safety argument *consumes* — so it is a typed hypothesis the runtime discharges, not
prose and not a `sorry`. -/

/-- **`HonestRatifierConvergence cfg lid₁ lid₂ V` — the post-GST dissemination residual, named.**
Over a combined ratification-vote universe `V` (the union of two laces' materialized ratifier votes),
this is the witness that gossip/reliable-broadcast convergence has produced a *single honest*
participant that ratifies BOTH candidate leader ids. Its fields ARE the conclusion of
`BFT.honest_witness_in_intersection` *post-convergence*:

* `M` — the adversary/honesty discipline over `V` (`≤ f` Byzantine, `n > 3f`, honest-vote-once),
* `witness` — the converged honest ratifier,
* `honest` / `ratifies₁` / `ratifies₂` — it is honest and ratifies both leader ids on `V`.

This is exactly the `dissemination.rs` guarantee the safety argument needs and the SAME residual as
`BFT.lean`'s O2 — *deriving* it is the post-GST pacemaker/view-synchrony argument (see
`cm_pacemaker_residual`). Here it is a hypothesis the runtime discharges, never faked. -/
structure HonestRatifierConvergence (cfg : Finality.Config)
    (lid₁ lid₂ : Authority.Blocklace.BlockId) (V : List Vote) where
  /-- The adversary/honesty model over the combined ratification-vote universe `V`. -/
  M : BFTModel cfg V
  /-- The converged honest ratifier participant. -/
  witness : Nat
  /-- The witness is honest (non-Byzantine). -/

  ratifies₁ : witness ∈ votersFor V lid₁
  /-- After convergence, the witness ratifies leader id `lid₂` (visible on `V`). -/
  ratifies₂ : witness ∈ votersFor V lid₂

/-- **`HonestRatifierConvergence.ofQuorums` (PROVED) — the convergence witness IS the
quorum-intersection conclusion.** When BOTH leader ids reach the BFT quorum `n - f` on the combined
universe `V`, the converged honest ratifier exists: it is exactly the honest witness
`BFT.honest_witness_in_intersection` produces. So `HonestRatifierConvergence` is not a stronger
oracle than the safety core already grants under quorum — it is its existential output, named. -/
noncomputable def HonestRatifierConvergence.ofQuorums
    (cfg : Finality.Config) (V : List Vote) (M : BFTModel cfg V)
    (lid₁ lid₂ : Authority.Blocklace.BlockId)

    ratifies₁ := w.choose_spec.2.1
    ratifies₂ := w.choose_spec.2.2 }

/-- **`agreement_of_convergence` (PROVED) — agreement GIVEN the named dissemination residual.** With
the post-GST `HonestRatifierConvergence` witness in hand (the converged honest ratifier of both
leaders) plus the DAG honesty law (honest-one-ratification, here the BFT model's `honest_vote_once`)
and id-determinism, the two leaders collapse `l₁ = l₂`. This is the liveness-side companion to
`cordial_agreement`: it shows the dissemination residual is *exactly* what is needed — once the
runtime discharges `HonestRatifierConvergence`, agreement is mechanical. -/

/-! ## 4. The HARD residual, named: the post-GST pacemaker (OPEN-CM-LIVENESS / O2).

That a wave *eventually* super-ratifies a leader (the `tau` ordering makes progress) is the post-GST
pacemaker / view-synchrony argument — the SAME named obstruction as `BFT.lean`'s O2 and
`BeaconSpace`'s honest-leader hit. We name it as a `Prop`-valued statement and connect it to its
existing partial discharge over the randomness beacon, rather than restate or fake it. -/

/-- **`cm_pacemaker_residual votesOf cfg` — the `[hard] OPEN-CM-LIVENESS` residual, NAMED.** The
post-GST progress statement for Cordial-Miners: there EXISTS a round and a block that the network's
delivered votes commit by quorum. This is the conclusion a from-scratch pacemaker/view-synchrony
proof must establish; it is the SAME shape as `World.committedByQuorum`-existence and the SAME
obstruction as `BFT.lean`'s O2. It is stated, never assumed here as a global axiom — its discharge is
the partial-synchrony pacemaker argument, partially supplied over the beacon (next theorem). -/
def cm_pacemaker_residual {Msg : Type} [World Msg]
    (votesOf : List Msg → List Vote) (cfg : Finality.Config) : Prop :=
  ∃ (r : Nat) (block : Nat), committedByQuorum votesOf r cfg block

/-- **`cm_pacemaker_from_gstRound` (PROVED) — the residual reduces to a delivered GST round.** GIVEN
a post-GST round whose honest supermajority's votes are delivered (`BFT.GSTRound` — DLS88 Δ-delivery
+ HotStuff responsive view), the Cordial-Miners pacemaker residual holds. So the irreducible part of
`cm_pacemaker_residual` is exactly "after GST an honest quorum's votes are delivered" — the named O2
obstruction, no more. The `GSTRound → committed` step is `BFT.gst_liveness_from_round_model`. -/

  ⟨r, block, BFT.gst_liveness_from_round_model votesOf cfg block hgst⟩

/-! ## 5. Non-vacuity for the residuals.

The dissemination residual `HonestRatifierConvergence` is non-vacuous. We build it on a concrete,
*computed-from-the-lace* ratifier set: the three distinct ratifiers `0,1,2` the inhabiting lace
`ratLace` exhibits for `rg1` (`CordialMiners.Inhabited.quorum_from_lace`), materialized via
`votesFromVoters`. The `votersFor` count is then read off by the proven `votersFor_votesFromVoters`,
the empty adversary inhabits `BFTModel`, and `ofQuorums` produces the converged honest ratifier — so
the named post-GST residual is inhabited by a real super-ratified leader's ratifier set. -/

/-! ## 6. Axiom hygiene — every additive keystone is kernel-clean.

`#assert_axioms` FAILS the build if any of these depends on `sorryAx`. The `xsort` keystones reduce
to `Nat` order + `List.insertionSort`/`pairwise_insertionSort` (`sorry`-free mathlib); the
single-lace agreement reduces to the existing `cordial_agreement_from_lace`; the convergence keystones
reduce to `BFT.honest_witness_in_intersection` / `BFTModel.honest_vote_once` (structure fields, not
axioms). We do NOT pin `cm_pacemaker_residual` (a `def` of a `Prop`) — it is a NAMED statement, and
its from-scratch proof is the explicit `[hard]` O2 pacemaker obstruction, deliberately left as a
typed residual rather than faked. -/
