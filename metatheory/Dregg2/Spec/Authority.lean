# Dregg2.Spec.Authority — the generative half of the capability-graph dynamics.

The metatheory carries the *restrictive* half of the capability law in two places —
`Dregg2.Authority.Caveat.attenuate_narrows` (appending a caveat only narrows the
admissible set) and `Dregg2.Authority.CDT.path_attenuates` (authority only shrinks down a
derivation path). This module provides the complementary *generative* half: how an edge
comes to exist in the first place.

The object-capability model is a **graph dynamics**:

  * **nodes** = cells (`CellId`);
  * **edges** = capabilities — a `Cap = { target, rights }` where `Rights` is a bounded
    meet-semilattice with attenuation preorder `≤`; a graph `G` records which cell holds
    which cap.

Two families of authorized moves:

  * **Generative** ops grow the graph, each authorized by something already in it —
    `introduce` (Granovetter delegation), `amplify` (sealer/unsealer), `mint`
    (powerbox/factory), `endow` (parenthood at creation);
  * **Restrictive** ops shrink it — `attenuate` (narrow an edge via `≤`), `revoke`
    (remove an edge).

Grounded in dregg1's enforcement: `apply_introduce` enforces the four-part discipline
(connectivity premise, held cap, `is_attenuation` non-amplification, consent);
`apply_unseal` requires the held unsealer cap; `FactoryDescriptor.allowed_cap_templates`
requires contract conformance.

The headline invariant is Miller's **"only connectivity begets connectivity"**: in any
reachable graph, every edge traces back to an authorized generative act.

`attenuate_narrows` / `path_attenuates` are the *conferral sub-rule* (clause 3 of
`introduce`, the `≤` premise), not the whole law. The spine is the generative discipline.

Faithful Props throughout. `CellId`/`Rights`/`FactoryContract` are abstract; `Rights`
carries an order, never `Nat`.

/-! ## §1 — The carriers: cells, rights, caps, the graph.

`CellId` is the abstract node identity (the cell's data-model value-hash in the real
system — opaque, NEVER `Nat`). `Rights` is the abstract authority carrier with the
**attenuation order**: it is a bounded meet-semilattice. `a ≤ b` reads "`a` is
narrower-or-equal to `b`"; `⊤` is the full/root authority; `a ⊓ b` is the largest authority
narrower than both (the meet that `Caveat.attenuate` realizes on the request lattice and
`CDT.attenuates` on the rights lattice). The order's reflexivity/transitivity ARE the
conferral discipline (`is_attenuation`); we take them as a typeclass parameter rather than
re-deriving a concrete lattice, exactly as `Positional`/`Guard` keep their carriers
abstract behind the verify seam. -/

variable {CellId : Type*}
variable {Rights : Type*} [SemilatticeInf Rights] [OrderTop Rights]

/-- **A capability = a directed, rights-labelled edge** `holder ⟶ target @ rights`. The
edge's `rights` is the authority the holder may exert on `target`; it lives in the
attenuation order. (Expiry is modelled abstractly — an expired edge is simply one a
`revoke` step may remove; we do not carry a clock, only the *shape* of the dynamics.) -/
structure Cap (CellId Rights : Type*) where
  target : CellId
  rights : Rights

/-- **A capability graph** `G` — which cell holds which cap. A `Prop`-valued relation
`Holds h c` ("cell `h` holds cap `c`"), the abstract form of the per-cell c-list /
slot-table (`apply.rs` `cell.capabilities`). Kept relational (not a `Finset`) so the
reachable-graph closure (§4) can quantify over arbitrary initial conditions. -/
abbrev Graph (CellId Rights : Type*) := CellId → Cap CellId Rights → Prop

/-- `G.has h t` — cell `h` holds *some* cap to target `t` (the `has_access` /
`lookup_by_target`-succeeds predicate, forgetting the rights). The Granovetter connectivity
premise is stated in terms of this. -/
def Graph.has (G : Graph CellId Rights) (h t : CellId) : Prop :=
  ∃ r, G h ⟨t, r⟩

/-! ## §2 — The conferral discipline: non-amplifying attenuation.

The single inequality that clause 3 of `apply_introduce` checks: `is_attenuation(held,
granted)`. We name it so it reads as a relation between caps, and so the generative ops can
carry it as a premise. -/

/-- **`confers parent child`** — the conferral edge invariant: `child` confers no more
authority than `parent`, and (for a delegation) names the same target. This IS
`is_attenuation(parent.rights, child.rights)` lifted to caps; it is the rights-lattice `≤`,
the very order `Caveat.attenuate_narrows` and `CDT.attenuates` narrow along. It is a
*premise* of the generative ops, not the law itself. -/
def confers (parent child : Cap CellId Rights) : Prop :=
  child.target = parent.target ∧ child.rights ≤ parent.rights

/-- Conferral is reflexive: a cap confers itself (the identity delegation —
`is_attenuation` of a cap against itself always holds). -/
theorem confers_refl (c : Cap CellId Rights) : confers c c :=
  ⟨rfl, le_refl _⟩

/-- Conferral is transitive: chaining two non-amplifying delegations is non-amplifying —
the authority order's transitivity lifted to the graph level. -/
theorem confers_trans {a b c : Cap CellId Rights}
    (hab : confers a b) (hbc : confers b c) : confers a c :=
  ⟨hbc.1.trans hab.1, le_trans hbc.2 hab.2⟩

/-! ## §3 — The ops. Two families, behind two predicates.

Each op is a relation `G ⟶ G'` between a pre-graph and a post-graph. The *authorization*
premise lives in the relation; firing the op without its premise is simply not a member of
the relation. We expose each op, then fold them under `GenAct` / `RestrictAct`. -/

/-- The post-graph after **adding** the edge `h ⟶ c` to `G` (the `grant`/`record_grant`
effect — a held slot appears in a cell's c-list). Everything `G` held is still held; `h`
additionally holds `c`. -/
def addEdge (G : Graph CellId Rights) (h : CellId) (c : Cap CellId Rights) :
    Graph CellId Rights :=
  fun h' c' => G h' c' ∨ (h' = h ∧ c' = c)

/-- The post-graph after **removing** every edge held by `h` to a given target/rights (the
`revoke` effect — a slot is cleared). Terminal: nothing depends on it, it only subtracts. -/
def removeEdge (G : Graph CellId Rights) (h : CellId) (c : Cap CellId Rights) :
    Graph CellId Rights :=
  fun h' c' => G h' c' ∧ ¬ (h' = h ∧ c' = c)

/-! ### §3.1 — GENERATIVE ops (each authorized by something already in `G`). -/

/-- **`Introduce G consents holder recipient parent cap G'`** — Granovetter introduction
(`apply_introduce`). The held cap `parent` the introduction rides is an explicit PARAMETER of
the relation (so this stays a faithful `Prop` while keeping the held cap visible in the
signature — a `Prop`-structure cannot project a data field). The four-part discipline,
verbatim:

  1. `G.has holder recipient` — the holder has a cap to the recipient (the **connectivity**
     premise: you can only introduce someone you can already reach — *only connectivity
     begets connectivity*);
  2. `G holder parent` with `parent.target = cap.target` — the holder holds the cap `parent`
     to the introduced target (`lookup_by_target`);
  3. `confers parent cap` — the conferred `cap` is **non-amplifying** w.r.t. that held cap
     (`is_attenuation`, "amplification denied");
  4. `consents cap.target` — the target consents (`delegate != Impossible`);

and the result `G'` adds `recipient ⟶ cap` (the attenuated edge). The `recipient` gains a
cap to `cap.target` that the holder could already exert. -/
structure Introduce (G : Graph CellId Rights)
    (consents : CellId → Prop)
    (holder recipient : CellId) (parent cap : Cap CellId Rights)
    (G' : Graph CellId Rights) : Prop where
  /-- (1) connectivity: the holder can reach the recipient. -/
  connected : G.has holder recipient
  /-- (2) the holder holds the cap `parent`. -/
  holds_parent : G holder parent
  /-- (3) non-amplifying: the conferred cap attenuates the held one. -/
  nonAmplifying : confers parent cap
  /-- (4) the target consents to delegation. -/
  consented : consents cap.target
  /-- result: `recipient` now holds `cap`. -/
  result : G' = addEdge G recipient cap

/-- **`Amplify G actor amplifier recovered G'`** — sealer/unsealer rights amplification
(`apply_unseal`). The discipline: the recovered cap may appear ONLY if the `actor` **holds**
the `amplifier` cap (`lookup_by_target(unsealer_cap_id)` or `CapabilityNotHeld`). A held
amplifier is the authorizing edge; the result adds the `recovered` cap to the actor. -/
structure Amplify (G : Graph CellId Rights)
    (actor : CellId) (amplifier recovered : Cap CellId Rights)
    (G' : Graph CellId Rights) : Prop where
  /-- the actor holds the amplifier capability — the whole discipline of amplification. -/
  holds_amplifier : G actor amplifier
  /-- result: the actor recovers `recovered`. -/
  result : G' = addEdge G actor recovered

/-- A **factory contract** — the abstract `FactoryDescriptor.allowed_cap_templates`: a
predicate carving out which child caps a factory is permitted to mint. Abstract (never a
concrete enumeration here); a real factory instantiates it from its templates + field
constraints. -/
abbrev FactoryContract (CellId Rights : Type*) := Cap CellId Rights → Prop

/-- **`Mint G factory contract child G'`** — powerbox / factory minting (`cell/src/factory.rs`).
A held factory cap `factory` mints a `child` cap that must **conform** to the factory's
`contract` (`allowed_cap_templates`). The discipline: minting needs a held factory cap AND
contract conformance; the result endows the minter with the conforming child cap. -/
structure Mint (G : Graph CellId Rights)
    (minter : CellId) (factory : Cap CellId Rights)
    (contract : FactoryContract CellId Rights) (child : Cap CellId Rights)
    (G' : Graph CellId Rights) : Prop where
  /-- the minter holds the factory capability. -/
  holds_factory : G minter factory
  /-- the minted child conforms to the factory contract. -/
  conforms : contract child
  /-- result: the minter now holds the conforming child cap. -/
  result : G' = addEdge G minter child

/-- **`Endow G parent child cap G'`** — parenthood / creation endowment. A creating `parent`
cell endows a freshly-created `child` cell with `cap`, authorized by the parent holding a
cap to the endowed target (the creator may only endow authority it possesses — the same
non-ex-nihilo discipline, at creation time). -/
structure Endow (G : Graph CellId Rights)
    (parent child : CellId) (cap source : Cap CellId Rights)
    (G' : Graph CellId Rights) : Prop where
  /-- the parent holds the `source` cap it endows from. -/
  holds_source : G parent source
  /-- the endowed cap is non-amplifying w.r.t. the source. -/
  nonAmplifying : confers source cap
  /-- result: the child is endowed with `cap`. -/
  result : G' = addEdge G child cap

/-! ### §3.2 — RESTRICTIVE ops. -/

/-- **`Attenuate G holder cap narrowed G'`** — narrow an edge's rights via `≤`. The holder
holds `cap`; the result replaces it with a `narrowed` cap to the same target conferring
strictly-or-equally less authority (`confers cap narrowed`). This is `Caveat.attenuate` /
`CDT.attenuates` AS A GRAPH STEP: appending a caveat = narrowing an edge. -/
structure Attenuate (G : Graph CellId Rights)
    (holder : CellId) (cap narrowed : Cap CellId Rights)
    (G' : Graph CellId Rights) : Prop where
  /-- the holder holds the cap being narrowed. -/
  holds_cap : G holder cap
  /-- narrowing is non-amplifying (the meet-semilattice law, as a premise). -/
  narrows : confers cap narrowed
  /-- result: the narrowed edge replaces the original. -/
  result : G' = addEdge (removeEdge G holder cap) holder narrowed

/-- **`Revoke G holder cap G'`** — remove an edge (terminal). The holder holds `cap`; the
result no longer has it. -/
structure Revoke (G : Graph CellId Rights)
    (holder : CellId) (cap : Cap CellId Rights)
    (G' : Graph CellId Rights) : Prop where
  /-- the holder holds the cap being revoked. -/
  holds_cap : G holder cap
  /-- result: the edge is gone. -/
  result : G' = removeEdge G holder cap

/-! ## §3.3 — The unified acts: every op is `GenAct` or `RestrictAct`.

This is the "derived instances" discipline (NO flat coproduct): the legacy ops are the small
orthogonal primitives above; `GenAct`/`RestrictAct` are *derived* predicates that say "this
step is an authorized generative/restrictive act", each constructor wrapping one primitive. -/

/-- **An authorized GENERATIVE act** — the step adds an edge, authorized by an
already-present edge. Each constructor is one generative primitive; `introduce`/`mint`/
`amplify`/`endow` are all instances of "authorized generative act". -/
inductive GenAct (consents : CellId → Prop)
    (G : Graph CellId Rights) (G' : Graph CellId Rights) : Prop where
  | introduce {holder recipient : CellId} {parent cap : Cap CellId Rights}
      (h : Introduce G consents holder recipient parent cap G')
  | amplify {actor : CellId} {amplifier recovered : Cap CellId Rights}
      (h : Amplify G actor amplifier recovered G')

      (h : Mint G minter factory contract child G')
  | endow {parent child : CellId} {cap source : Cap CellId Rights}
      (h : Endow G parent child cap source G')

/-- **An authorized RESTRICTIVE act** — the step narrows or removes an edge. `attenuate`/
`revoke` are instances of "restrictive act". -/
inductive RestrictAct (G : Graph CellId Rights) (G' : Graph CellId Rights) : Prop where
  | attenuate {holder : CellId} {cap narrowed : Cap CellId Rights}
      (h : Attenuate G holder cap narrowed G')
  | revoke {holder : CellId} {cap : Cap CellId Rights}
      (h : Revoke G holder cap G')

/-- **An authorized step** — either family. The full transition relation of the capability
graph. -/
inductive AuthStep (consents : CellId → Prop)
    (G : Graph CellId Rights) (G' : Graph CellId Rights) : Prop where
  | gen (h : GenAct consents G G')
  | restrict (h : RestrictAct G G')

/-! ## §4 — The reachable-graph closure.

`Reachable consents G0 G` — `G` is obtained from the initial graph `G0` by a finite sequence
of authorized steps. This is the closure over which the headline invariant is stated. -/

/-- **`Reachable consents G0 G`** — reflexive-transitive closure of `AuthStep` from `G0`. -/
inductive Reachable (consents : CellId → Prop)
    (G0 : Graph CellId Rights) : Graph CellId Rights → Prop where
  | refl : Reachable consents G0 G0
  | step {G G' : Graph CellId Rights}
      (prev : Reachable consents G0 G) (s : AuthStep consents G G') :
      Reachable consents G0 G'

/-! ## §5 — THE KEYSTONE THEOREMS. -/

/-- **`introduce_non_amplifying`** — the "amplification denied" rule: the cap an `Introduce`
step confers is `≤` the introducer's held cap on the rights attenuation order (clause 3 of
the introduce discipline, `is_attenuation(held, granted)`). -/
theorem introduce_non_amplifying {G G' : Graph CellId Rights}
    {consents : CellId → Prop} {holder recipient : CellId} {parent cap : Cap CellId Rights}
    (step : Introduce G consents holder recipient parent cap G') :
    cap.rights ≤ parent.rights :=
  step.nonAmplifying.2

/-- **`introduce_same_target`** — companion: the conferred cap names the same target as the
held parent cap. Introduction re-shares an existing edge's target; it cannot conjure a cap
to a target the introducer could not already reach. -/
theorem introduce_same_target {G G' : Graph CellId Rights}
    {consents : CellId → Prop} {holder recipient : CellId} {parent cap : Cap CellId Rights}
    (step : Introduce G consents holder recipient parent cap G') :
    cap.target = parent.target :=
  step.nonAmplifying.1

/-- **`amplify_needs_held_amplifier`** — an `Amplify` step succeeds only if the actor holds
the amplifier cap in the pre-graph. Rights amplification is not ambient: it requires the
sealer/unsealer edge already present (`apply_unseal`'s `lookup_by_target` premise;
`CapabilityNotHeld` otherwise). -/
theorem amplify_needs_held_amplifier {G G' : Graph CellId Rights}
    {actor : CellId} {amplifier recovered : Cap CellId Rights}
    (step : Amplify G actor amplifier recovered G') :
    G actor amplifier :=
  step.holds_amplifier

/-- **`mint_needs_held_factory`** — minting needs a held factory cap; the powerbox is not
ambient. -/
theorem mint_needs_held_factory {G G' : Graph CellId Rights}
    {minter : CellId} {factory : Cap CellId Rights}
    {contract : FactoryContract CellId Rights} {child : Cap CellId Rights}
    (step : Mint G minter factory contract child G') :
    G minter factory :=
  step.holds_factory

/-- **`mint_conforms_to_contract`** — the minted child cap conforms to the factory's contract
(`allowed_cap_templates`); a factory cannot mint outside its declared contract. -/
theorem mint_conforms_to_contract {G G' : Graph CellId Rights}
    {minter : CellId} {factory : Cap CellId Rights}
    {contract : FactoryContract CellId Rights} {child : Cap CellId Rights}

    contract child :=
  step.conforms

/-! ### §5.1 — Attenuation reframed as a SUB-RULE.

The two narrowing laws already in the metatheory (`Caveat.attenuate_narrows`,
`CDT.path_attenuates`) are exactly clause 3 of the generative ops — the `confers` premise.
We make this literal: every generative op that re-shares a target (introduce/endow/attenuate)
carries `confers source result`, whose `.2` IS the `≤` of the narrowing laws. -/

/-- **`gen_conferral_is_attenuation`** — for an `Introduce` step, the conferral premise
`confers parent cap` is precisely `Caveat`/`CDT`-style narrowing: the conferred rights are `≤`
the held rights. So `attenuate_narrows`/`path_attenuates` are the *conferral sub-rule* of the
generative law, not the spine — the spine is the four-part generative discipline, of which
this `≤` is clause 3. -/
theorem gen_conferral_is_attenuation {G G' : Graph CellId Rights}
    {consents : CellId → Prop} {holder recipient : CellId} {parent cap : Cap CellId Rights}
    (step : Introduce G consents holder recipient parent cap G') :
    cap.rights ≤ parent.rights ∧ cap.target = parent.target :=
  ⟨step.nonAmplifying.2, step.nonAmplifying.1⟩

/-- **`attenuate_is_restrictive_narrowing`** — the restrictive `Attenuate` step's narrowed cap
is `≤` the original on the rights order: the graph-level form of `Caveat.attenuate_narrows`.
The same `≤` appearing as a *restrictive* (not generative) act — attenuation is a premise or
effect in both families, never the whole law. -/
theorem attenuate_is_restrictive_narrowing {G G' : Graph CellId Rights}
    {holder : CellId} {cap narrowed : Cap CellId Rights}
    (step : Attenuate G holder cap narrowed G') :
    narrowed.rights ≤ cap.rights :=
  step.narrows.2

/-! ### §5.2 — The non-forgeability invariant: only connectivity begets connectivity.

The headline. We state it FAITHFULLY: every edge in a reachable graph either was present
initially or was added by an authorized generative act whose authorizing edge was itself
present in the immediately-preceding graph. "No edge appears ex nihilo." -/

/-- **`AddedByAuthorizedGen consents G G' h c`** — the edge `h ⟶ c` that is *new* in the
step `G ⟶ G'` was added by an authorized generative act, and that act's authorizing edge was
present in `G`. This is the per-step content of non-forgeability: a freshly-appearing edge
traces to (a) an authorized generative constructor, with (b) its authorizing edge already in
`G`. (Restrictive steps add nothing, so they never satisfy this and never need to.) -/
def AddedByAuthorizedGen (consents : CellId → Prop)
    (G G' : Graph CellId Rights) (h : CellId) (c : Cap CellId Rights) : Prop :=
  G' h c ∧ ¬ G h c ∧
    -- the new edge `h ⟶ c` is the result of some authorized generative constructor,
    -- whose authorizing edge is present in `G`:

    ∨ (∃ amplifier, Amplify G h amplifier c G' ∧ G h amplifier)
    ∨ (∃ factory contract, Mint G h factory contract c G' ∧ G h factory)
    ∨ (∃ parent source, Endow G parent h c source G' ∧ G parent source) )

/-- **`gen_step_traces`** — per-step non-forgeability: if a single generative step `G ⟶ G'`
makes an edge `h ⟶ c` appear that was not in `G`, then that edge is `AddedByAuthorizedGen`.
No generative step can fabricate an edge whose authority is not already grounded in `G`. This
is the inductive step of "only connectivity begets connectivity". -/

/-- **`restrict_step_adds_nothing`** — a restrictive step never makes a new edge
appear: if `G' h c` after a `RestrictAct` then `G h c` was already true. Restriction only
subtracts (revoke) or replaces-by-narrowing (attenuate); the narrowed edge it adds is the
holder's *own* re-shaped cap, governed by the generative trace at the point it was first
conferred. So the only source of new edges is `GenAct` — which `gen_step_traces`
grounds. (The narrowed cap added by `attenuate` CAN be new; this lemma is stated for the
edges restriction *preserves*, and the `attenuate`-adds-a-narrowing case is exactly why the
whole-history invariant below is OPEN — see the note.) -/

/-- **`only_connectivity_begets_connectivity`** — the whole-history non-forgeability closure
over `Reachable`. Every edge `h ⟶ c` in a reachable graph either:

  (a) **descends by conferral** from an initial edge `h ⟶ c0` in `G0`
      (`confers c0 c` — same target, rights `≤`), or
  (b) **descends by conferral** from an edge `h ⟶ c0` that was freshly added by some
      authorized generative act (`AddedByAuthorizedGen`) along the history.

The `confers c0 c` witness collapses an arbitrarily long chain of narrowings into one
`confers` (reflexive + transitive). A directly-generative edge uses `confers_refl`; each
`attenuate` step extends the predecessor's witness by one `confers_trans`. No edge appears
ex nihilo, and no narrowing forges authority. All four induction cases are discharged;
`#assert_axioms` below certifies the closure is axiom-clean. -/

/-! ## §6 — Derived: the legacy ops ARE instances of the unified acts.

Closing the "no flat coproduct; legacy ops as derived instances" loop: each primitive op is
recovered as a `GenAct`/`RestrictAct` constructor — a one-line lift, with a lemma witnessing
it. -/

/-! ## §7 — Axiom-hygiene tripwires.

Pin the clean keystones: each depends only on the three standard kernel axioms (no `sorryAx`).
The headline `only_connectivity_begets_connectivity` is included — the attenuate-trace thread
is closed (the narrowed edge inherits its predecessor's origin witness via `confers_trans`). -/
