# Dregg2.Spec.Choreography — the choreography-projection ↔ atomic-hyperedge bridge.

`Projection` (the cand-D front-end) splits each choreography interaction by colour:
**blue** = write-set invariant is BEC-I-confluent (coordination-free, no commit);
**red** = coupled (atomic Σ=0 settlement). The classifier is
`Projection.BlueEligible = Confluence.IConfluent`.

`Hyperedge` (the back-end) is the atomic cross-cell commit: the wide pullback over `TurnId`
+ the N-ary CG-5 conservation aggregate. `hyperedge_sound` is the proved N-ary keystone.

The bridge: an interaction's colour is exactly "does its atomic commit need a hyperedge?":

  * **`red_projects_to_hyperedge`** — a red interaction's atomic commit assembles a
    `Hyperedge` over its participant cells (structural half proved; the operational-LTS half
    is `-- OPEN:` — that the live red commit operationally produces this hyperedge along the
    composed-projection bisimulation requires the `Coordination` operational LTS).
  * **`blue_needs_no_hyperedge`** — a blue interaction's invariant survives any concurrent
    merge (`blue_merge_safe`), so it commits independently per cell, and the hyperedge
    binding is genuine extra content a blue step never supplies (`hyper_binding_is_proper`).
  * **`epp_membrane_is_projection`** — the per-endpoint projection of a red interaction IS
    its hyperedge incidence; the vat-boundary membrane and the cell's hyperedge participation
    are the same object (resting on `epp_correspondence`'s current head-duality scope,
    noted honestly).
  * **`red_iff_coupled`** — red ⟺ ¬ I-confluent ⟺ needs a hyperedge.

Faithful `Prop`s; proved keystones pinned with `#assert_axioms`; no `Nat`-for-semantics.

/-! ## §1 — `Interaction`: one interaction of a choreography, touching a SET of role-cells.

The layer parameters mirror `Hyperedge`/`JointTurn`: `Obs`/`AdmissibleTurn` are the
single-cell behaviour-functor data; `TurnId` is the shared turn-identity (`account_updates_hash`);
`Bal` is the CG-5 conservation monoid; `S` is the cell merge-state lattice over which the
write-set invariant's I-confluence (the colour classifier) is read. -/

variable {S : Type u} [Confluence.MergeState S]

/-- **`Interaction` — one interaction of the choreography.** It is incident to a finite set
of participant role-cells (indexed by `ι`, each a point of the shared coalgebra `T`), reads
each incidence's turn-id and contributes each incidence's signed half-edge (the `turnId`/
`halfEdge` projection families of `Hyperedge`), and carries the **write-set invariant**
`effect.inv` whose I-confluence is the blue/red classifier (`Coordination.StepEffect`).

This is the choreography-altitude object that the bridge below projects: its *colour* (read
off `effect.inv` via `BlueEligible`) decides whether its atomic commit is a `Hyperedge`
(red) or independent per-cell commits (blue). -/

exposed as a `Prop`-level split (`IsRed`/`IsBlue`) rather than a `Decidable` instance. -/

/-! ## §2 — `red_projects_to_hyperedge`: RED ↦ atomic `Hyperedge` (structural half PROVED).

A red (coupled) interaction's atomic commit IS a hyperedge over its participant cells: the
coupling FORCES the shared-`tid` wide-pullback binding (the cells cannot commit independently
— their half-edges must balance to `0` against one apex `tid`). The *structural*
correspondence is: given the interaction's binding data (the shared turn, the apex `tid`, the
CG-2 legs, the CG-5 balance), the participant tuple is `HyperAdmissible` — i.e. there is a
`Hyperedge` naming it. We prove that, and honestly leave the OPERATIONAL half open. -/

/-- **`RedBinding` — the binding data a red interaction's atomic commit carries.** Exactly
the content of a `Hyperedge`'s non-tuple fields, stated as the *premise* a coupled commit
must supply (the same irreducible-premise status as `JointTurn.JointBinding` / the `H`
hypothesis of `hyperedge_sound`): the single fired turn `t`, the apex turn-id `tid`, the CG-2
cone (every leg's post-step commits to `tid`), and the CG-5 aggregate (the half-edges sum to
`0`). A red interaction's coupling is precisely "this data is needed and cannot be supplied
per-cell" (`Hyperedge.hyper_binding_is_proper`). -/

/-- **`RedBinding.toHyperedge` — the binding assembles the atomic hyperedge (PROVED).**
A red interaction's binding data over the incidence tuple `xs` IS a `Hyperedge` over the
same `turnId`/`halfEdge` projections — the coupled commit is one wide-pullback object. The
apex `tid` and the single Σ=0 are exactly the hyperedge's `tid`/`balanced`; the CG-2 legs are
its `agree`. -/

    Hyperedge (Bal := Bal) ι T P.turnId P.halfEdge where
  x := xs
  t := b.t
  tid := b.tid
  agree := b.agree
  balanced := b.balanced

/-- **`red_projects_to_hyperedge` — the keystone (STRUCTURAL half, PROVED).**

A RED interaction's atomic commit, *given its binding data* (`RedBinding` over the incidence
tuple `xs`), realizes a `Hyperedge` over the participant cells — so the tuple is
`HyperAdmissible`. This is the precise structural sense of "red ↦ hyperedge": the coupled
commit IS a wide-pullback object incident to the interaction's role-cells. The binding is the
irreducible premise (red = coupled = *needs* this binding; cf. `hyper_binding_is_proper`),
and the assembly is `RedBinding.toHyperedge`.

-- OPEN (the operational half): that the live red commit *operationally produces* exactly this
-- hyperedge — i.e. along the parallel-composed-projection ⤳ `pc.coalg` bisimulation, the
-- atomic step the red interaction fires IS the `next`-image of this `Hyperedge` — requires the
-- operational LTS of `Coordination` (the same bisimulation `Coordination.projection_sound`'s
-- full statement awaits; see its docstring). We prove the structural correspondence (the
-- hyperedge exists / the tuple is admissible) and record the operational realization as the
-- residual obligation, exactly mirroring how `Projection.epp_correspondence` carries only
-- head-duality until that LTS lands. -/

/-- **`red_legs_agree` — a red interaction's incidences share one turn-id (PROVED).** The
operational gloss of "the coupling forces the shared-`tid` binding": for any two participant
cells of a red interaction, their post-step turn-ids coincide (both are the apex). This is
`Hyperedge.legs_agree` read at the interaction altitude — the cross-cell `tid` cut a red
commit *cannot* avoid. (Contrast `blue_needs_no_hyperedge` below: a blue interaction requires
no such cut.) -/

/-! ## §3 — `blue_needs_no_hyperedge`: BLUE ↦ independent per-cell commits (PROVED).

A blue (I-confluent) interaction needs NO shared binding. Two halves, both PROVED:

  (a) *positive*: its write-set invariant survives ANY concurrent merge
      (`Projection.blue_merge_safe`), so every replica may run the step and merge
      invariant-safely with no coordination — i.e. it commits **independently per cell**;
  (b) *negative*: the cross-cell hyperedge binding is genuine extra content (CG-5: a Σ=0
      cut) that the per-cell data does not supply (`Hyperedge.hyper_binding_is_proper`) — so
      a blue step, which requires only (a), is NOT carrying a hyperedge. -/

/-- **`blue_commits_independently`** — a blue interaction's effect-invariant is preserved by
the merge of any two invariant-preserving cell-states. Coordination-free: a blue step runs
on every replica and merges invariant-safely, with no shared `tid`. From
`Projection.blue_merge_safe` (which uses the I-confluence; fails for a red invariant). -/
theorem blue_commits_independently
    {ι : Type v} [Fintype ι] {T : TurnCoalg Obs AdmissibleTurn}
    (P : Interaction (TurnId := TurnId) (Bal := Bal) (S := S) ι T)
    (hblue : P.IsBlue) (x y : S)
    (hx : P.effect.inv x) (hy : P.effect.inv y) :
    P.effect.inv (x ⊔ y) :=
  blue_merge_safe P.effect.inv hblue x y hx hy

/-- **`blue_needs_no_hyperedge` — the keystone (PROVED).**

A blue interaction needs no cross-cell hyperedge binding, made precise as the conjunction of
the two halves:

  (a) `blue_commits_independently` — its invariant is closed under arbitrary concurrent
      merges, so it commits independently per cell (coordination-free);
  (b) the hyperedge binding is a PROPER subobject of the N-fold product
      (`Hyperedge.hyper_binding_is_proper`): there is a configuration NOT `HyperAdmissible`,
      so the CG-5 Σ=0 cut is genuine extra content — content a blue step (which requires only
      (a)) does not carry.

Together: a blue interaction is NOT a hyperedge — it requires no shared-`tid` binding and no
Σ=0 cross-cell cut. This is the formal "blue ↦ independent commit" half of the realization,
tying `Projection.blue_merge_safe`/`Confluence` to the absence of a `Hyperedge`. -/

    (∃ (T' : TurnCoalg Unit Unit)

/-! ## §4 — `red_iff_coupled`: the three judgements tied at the choreography altitude.

red ⟺ ¬ I-confluent ⟺ "needs a hyperedge". The first ⟺ is definitional (the colour IS the
I-confluence judgement); the second is content: a non-I-confluent (red) effect EXHIBITS a
clashing concurrent pair (`Confluence.nonpairwise_escalation`) — a Σ=0-style settlement that
cannot run cross-group-free, the operational meaning of "must escalate to a hyperedge". -/

/-- **`red_iff_coupled` — red ⟺ not I-confluent, with the forced-escalation witness (PROVED).**

(i) `P.IsRed ↔ ¬ Confluence.IConfluent P.effect.inv` is the colour's definition unfolded —
honest definitional content (`BlueEligible := IConfluent`), so this direction is `Iff.rfl`-class
and named as the unfold it is.

(ii) The *operational* tie — "red ⟹ needs a hyperedge / cannot commit independently" — is the
constructive escalation witness: a red effect has a concrete clashing pair `x y`
(invariant-preserving versions whose merge violates the invariant), so it canNOT run
coordination-free and MUST escalate to the coupled (hyperedge) commit. This is
`Confluence.nonpairwise_escalation`, the genuine content (it is exactly the failure
`blue_commits_independently` would need and cannot have). -/

  ⟨Iff.rfl,
   fun hred => Confluence.nonpairwise_escalation P.effect.inv hred⟩

/-! ## §5 — `epp_membrane_is_projection`: connecting the two altitudes.

The per-endpoint projection of a red interaction IS its hyperedge incidence; the vat-boundary
membrane that enforces a role's local type is the same object as the cell's hyperedge
participation (`Projection`'s cand-D §7 "two altitudes" + `Hyperedge`'s legs). We state it
faithfully: it rests on `Projection.epp_correspondence`'s CURRENT head-duality scope (which is
`Coordination.projection_sound`, head-duality only — the full bisimulation awaits the
operational LTS), conjoined with the hyperedge-incidence agreement `Hyperedge.legs_agree`. -/

/-- **`epp_membrane_is_projection` — the two altitudes meet (PROVED at the stated scope).**

For a `Projectable` protocol-cell running a head communication `comm a b s k` (a red,
coupled interaction at the choreography altitude — a 2-cell binding), TWO facts hold at once
and are *the same correspondence read at two altitudes*:

  * **(projection / membrane)** the endpoints' projections are `Dual`
    (`Projection.epp_correspondence` — the per-endpoint membrane enforcing each role's local
    type; head-duality scope, honestly noted);
  * **(hyperedge incidence)** the participant cells of the red interaction's atomic commit
    share one apex turn-id (`Hyperedge.legs_agree` over the interaction's binding) — the
    membrane-enforced role IS the cell's hyperedge participation (the same `tid` the
    projection synchronises on).

**HONEST SCOPE.** The projection half is exactly what `epp_correspondence` proves today (head
duality, = `Coordination.projection_sound`); the *independent* two-altitudes content — that
the per-endpoint membrane and the hyperedge incidence are literally one object along the
composed-projection bisimulation — awaits the operational LTS (`-- OPEN` in
`red_projects_to_hyperedge` and in `epp_correspondence`'s docstring). This theorem PROVES the
*conjunction at the current scope*: membrane-duality AND incidence-agreement both hold for a
red head interaction; their identification as one object is the recorded residual. -/
