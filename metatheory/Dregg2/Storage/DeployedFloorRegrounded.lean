# `Dregg2.Storage.DeployedFloorRegrounded` — the storage binding, CUT OVER off literal injectivity
onto the collision GAME the tree already had.

## The wound, already proved — this file does not re-litigate it

`Storage.DeployedFloorRefuted` proves three things and this file builds on all three:

  * `Poseidon2Binding.Poseidon2SpongeCR` is LITERAL INJECTIVITY, `∀ xs ys, sponge xs = sponge ys → xs = ys`;
  * `deployed_collides` — a free `rfl` collision of the deployed hash. ⛑ Its WITNESS moved on
    2026-07-26: it used to be `poseidon2Hash [-1] = poseidon2Hash [0]`, from the `x.toNat.toUInt64`
    clamp (an encoder BUG, now fixed — `Storage.canonLimb`); it is now
    `poseidon2Hash [0] = poseidon2Hash [p]`, from the mod-`p` reduction (correct field semantics);
  * so `deployed_floor_false` REFUTES the floor at the deployed hash, and no encoder repairs it —
    `poseidon2Hash` factors through `UInt64`, a finite image over an infinite domain, so exact
    injectivity is unsatisfiable at ANY encoding. The floor is MIS-SPECIFIED, not mis-implemented.

**A floor must be SATISFIABLE and REFUTABLE but NOT PROVABLE.** Injectivity fails the first clause at
every concrete hash, so it was never a floor; it was a false assumption worn as one.

## ⚑ THE MOST VALUABLE FINDING: THIS IS A CUTOVER, NOT A CONSTRUCTION

The replacement floor did NOT need to be built. It is on the shelf, in three pieces that already
compose:

  * `Crypto.FloorGames.Game` / `Hard G Eff` — a λ-indexed security game with the problem IN the win
    relation, and hardness quantified over an EXPLICIT adversary class `Eff`;
  * `Crypto.FloorGames.hashGame` / `HashCRHardQuant F Eff` — that schema at the COLLISION game of a
    `HashFloorHonesty.KeyedHashFamily`: the adversary is handed a uniformly sampled key and wins iff it
    outputs two DISTINCT inputs with equal images;
  * `Crypto.HashSigMerkleRegrounded.SpongeDeployment` / `spongeFamily` — the deployed Poseidon2 sponge
    already lifted to exactly that keyed family, carrying NO injectivity field.

So the floor is **`FloorGames.HashCRHardQuant (spongeFamily D) Eff`**, reused verbatim. Nothing about
collision resistance is invented here. What this file does is the CUTOVER: extractors, the reduction,
the poles, and the repaired storage keystone.

`Crypto.CommitmentBinding:75` already recorded the trap on the way: `HashFloorHonesty.CollisionResistant`
was NOT the replacement — it was a SPELLING of this floor at `Eff := ⊤` with the `⊤` hidden behind a
name, and `FloorGames.hashCRHardQuant_top_false_of_compressing` proves THAT false for every compressing
family. Copying it would have been the same disease one costume along. It was DELETED outright on
2026-07-28; the `⊤` is now written out wherever the class is unrestricted, which is the field a reader
needs in order to price an assumption.

## Why the chosen floor obeys the law

  * **SATISFIABLE** — `hashCRHardQuant_of_injective` (§2): a family injective at every key satisfies it
    at EVERY class, and `FloorGames.idFamily_hashCRHardQuant_top` exhibits one. Not empty — but note
    what such a witness IS: at `⊤` the floor holds exactly for the families that are not compressing,
    i.e. not hashes.
  * **REFUTABLE** — and, at the deployed encoder, ACTUALLY REFUTED (§4):
    `deployedFloor_refuted_by_modp_alias` proves the floor FALSE for any class containing the CONSTANT
    finder `fun _ _ => ([0], [p])`, whose advantage is the constant `1` because the alias collision holds
    by `rfl`. A constant finder is efficient under any cost model worth the name.
  * **NOT PROVABLE** — `Eff` is a parameter with no cost model in this repository
    (`FloorGames` §8); at `Eff := ⊤` the floor is FALSE for every compressing family, so it cannot be a
    theorem, and at `Eff := ⊥` it is vacuous (`hashCRHardQuant_bot_vacuous`). Both poles are proved
    below rather than promised.

## ⚑ AND THE DIFFERENCE THE CUTOVER MAKES, STATED SHARPLY

Injectivity was refuted at the deployed hash for an UNFIXABLE reason (cardinality). The game floor is
refuted at the deployed hash for a FIXABLE one (§4.1: the `Int.toNat` clamp was a plain encoder bug —
the canonical reduction separates `-1` from `0` where `toNat` merged them). That is the whole point of
having a floor that can go red for a REASON: a hash that fails injectivity tells you nothing, a hash
that fails the collision game hands you the collision.

⛑ **AND THE BUG THIS FILE NAMED HAS BEEN FIXED (2026-07-26).** `Storage/Deployed.lean` now encodes
limbs with `canonLimb` (`(x % babyBearP).toNat.toUInt64`) instead of the clamping `x.toNat.toUInt64`.
The negative-integer ghost channel is CLOSED — `Storage.prefix_ghost_pair_costs_a_sponge_collision`
proves the `key = -1` / `key = 0` pair now costs a genuine Poseidon2 collision instead of being free
by `rfl`. The floor is still RED at the deployed encoder (§4), but the witness moved to the mod-`p`
ALIAS, which is correct field semantics rather than a defect — and that residual is a WIRE-contract
question, not an encoder one (§4.1). This is the floor earning its keep twice: it diagnosed a real
bug, the bug got fixed, and it kept pointing at what is still open.

## What is migrated

`Lightclient.MMR` (`hashOf_binds_or_collides` / `bag_binds_or_collides` / `mroot_binds_or_collides`),
`Storage.BucketCommitment` (`objectLeaf_binds_or_collides` / `contentRoot_binds_or_collides` /
`read_sound_or_collides`), `Storage.Retrievability` (`por_sound_or_collides` /
`por_substitution_forces_collision` / `por_holds_committed_or_collides`) and `Storage.Deployed`
(`contentRootDeployed_binds_or_collides`) are all UNCONDITIONAL now — the floor is spent nowhere on the
live path. Each old keystone survives ONLY as a one-line strength bridge at the (refuted) injectivity,
which is the machine-checked proof that the cutover surrendered nothing.

## Axiom hygiene

`#assert_axioms` ⊆ {propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound} on every theorem. No `sorry`, no fresh
`axiom`, no `native_decide`.

/-! ## §1 — the floor, NAMED, and its two poles.

Both poles are stated once here so every consumer can price its own instantiation by citing them
rather than by promising anything. They are `InjectiveFloorRegrounded` §0's poles at the sponge family;
the shape is deliberately identical, because the three sibling carriers this campaign already cut over
landed on exactly this object. -/

/-- **THE ⊤ POLE.** The collision floor at the UNRESTRICTED adversary class is FALSE for any
COMPRESSING family: a collision at every key (pigeonhole forces it at deployed parameters, and it is the
defining property of a hash) makes the `Classical.choice` finder win with probability `1`. The honest
price of the `hEff` obligation, as a theorem instead of a promise. -/
theorem hashCRHardQuant_top_false_of_compressing (F : KeyedHashFamily) (hin : Nonempty F.Input)
    (hcol : ∀ l (k : F.Key l), ∃ x y : F.Input, x ≠ y ∧ F.H l k x = F.H l k y) :
    ¬ HashCRHardQuant F (fun _ => True) :=
  Dregg2.Crypto.FloorGames.hashCRHardQuant_top_false_of_compressing F hin hcol

/-- **THE ⊥ POLE.** At the empty adversary class the floor holds for ANY family, including a completely
broken one — so a satisfiability witness is worth nothing without the refutation beside it. Recorded so
`Eff` cannot be quietly filled with nothing. -/
theorem hashCRHardQuant_bot_vacuous (F : KeyedHashFamily) :
    HashCRHardQuant F (fun _ => False) :=
  hard_bot_vacuous _

/-! ## §2 — ⚑ INJECTIVITY IMPLIES THE GAME FLOOR: the cutover is a WEAKENING.

This is what makes the migration SAFE rather than merely different. The old hypothesis
(`Poseidon2SpongeCR` at every key) IMPLIES the new one at EVERY adversary class — an injective hash has
no collisions at all, so every finder's advantage is exactly `0`. Therefore every theorem that used to
be gated on injectivity, restated on the game floor, is implied by its old self: the migrated statements
are STRICTLY STRONGER, and the strictness is not rhetorical — §4 proves the old hypothesis is
UNAVAILABLE at the deployed hash while the new statements still hold there. -/

/-- **⚑ THE WEAKENING, PROVED.** A sponge deployment injective at every tag satisfies the collision
floor at EVERY adversary class `Eff` — including `⊤`. So `Poseidon2SpongeCR` (at every tag) is strictly
stronger than the floor that replaces it, and the cutover cannot have lost anything a consumer was
entitled to. -/

    HashCRHardQuant (spongeFamily D) Eff := fun A _ =>
  spongeFamily_CR_of_injective D hinj A trivial

/-- The same weakening at the OLD carrier's own name, so the audit reads directly (contradiction-style,
which is also its sharpest form): if the deleted `Poseidon2SpongeCR` hypothesis held at every tag, then
NO adversary in ANY class can have non-negligible collision advantage. `Poseidon2SpongeCR h` is
DEFINITIONALLY `Function.Injective h` — `Poseidon2Binding.compressNInjective_iff_poseidon2CR` records
that identity — so this is `hashCRHardQuant_of_injective` read at the sentinel's name. -/

  hnn (hashCRHardQuant_of_injective D (fun t xs ys h => hCR t xs ys h) Eff A hA)

/-- **SATISFIABILITY, WITNESSED.** The floor is not empty: `HashFloorHonesty.idFamily` (an injective
family) satisfies it at the unrestricted class, hence at every class. Read this ONLY beside §4's
refutation — a satisfiability witness alone is the FALSE COMFORT this campaign has been burned by three
times (a toy injective hash satisfies anything). -/

/-! ## §3 — the CONTENT-ROOT BREAK, as a first-class game, and the reduction.

The consumer's break is not a docstring: it is a `Game` whose win relation is a genuine violation of the
bucket binding on the REAL keyed sponge. The reduction from it to the collision game is a MAP OF
ADVERSARIES — a Lean function — plus a win-preservation theorem and an advantage inequality. Hypothesis
and conclusion are about DIFFERENT games, so the floor cannot be its own conclusion. -/

/-- **THE CONTENT-ROOT BREAK GAME.** The adversary is handed a uniformly sampled domain-separation tag
and WINS iff it outputs two DISTINCT object lists whose bucket content roots, under the sponge at that
tag, are EQUAL — i.e. it hides a ghost object under a genuine root. Exactly the break the deleted
`contentRoot_injective` denied, now something an adversary must FIND. -/

  Inst := fun _ => D.Tag

  wins := fun _ t c =>
    c.1 ≠ c.2 ∧ contentRoot (D.hashAt t) c.1 = contentRoot (D.hashAt t) c.2
  winsDec := fun _ _ _ => inferInstance

/-- **THE PROBLEM IS IN THE STATEMENT.** The break game's win relation is a genuine equivocation on the
DEPLOYED content root, not a paraphrase of one. -/

  Iff.rfl

/-- **THE EXTRACTOR, AS A MAP OF ADVERSARIES.** A bucket equivocator becomes a sponge-collision finder
by running `BucketCommitment.contentRootFind` on its own two object lists — the MMR walk down to the
first differing peak, or the first differing object's arity-3 preimage. Not a re-indexing and not a
rename: it is the binding proof, written as a function into the collision game of the real sponge. -/
def bucketBreakToFinder (D : SpongeDeployment) (A : Adversary (bucketBreakGame D)) :
    Adversary (hashGame (spongeFamily D)) where
  run := fun l t => let c := A.run l t; contentRootFind (D.hashAt t) c.1 c.2

/-- **⚑ THE REDUCTION IS WIN-PRESERVING — and this IS the bucket binding.** Wherever the equivocator
wins, the pair the extractor returns is a genuine collision of the sponge at that tag. The content is a
proof term (`contentRoot_binds_or_collides`, itself unconditional), not a sentence about one. -/
theorem bucket_wins_imp (D : SpongeDeployment) (A : Adversary (bucketBreakGame D)) (l : ℕ)

  obtain ⟨hne, heq⟩ := hwin
  exact (contentRoot_binds_or_collides (D.hashAt t) _ _ heq).resolve_left hne

/-- **THE ADVANTAGE INEQUALITY.** The equivocator's advantage is at most the extracted collision
finder's, at every parameter — the two games sample the SAME tag space, and every tag the equivocator
wins the extracted finder wins. A genuine reduction inequality over real game advantages. -/
theorem bucket_adv_le (D : SpongeDeployment) (A : Adversary (bucketBreakGame D)) (l : ℕ) :

/-- **⚑ THE REPAIRED STORAGE KEYSTONE, ON THE GAME FLOOR.**

Under the collision floor of the deployed sponge at the class `Eff`, an adversary that equivocates on a
bucket content root — two distinct object sets under one published root — has NEGLIGIBLE advantage. The
anti-ghost guarantee holds EXCEPT with negligible probability, and unlike its `Poseidon2SpongeCR`
predecessor it rests on a hypothesis that is not refuted by cardinality.

⚑ **THE `hEff` OBLIGATION IS UNDISCHARGED AND THAT IS THE HONEST STATE.** It says the extracted finder
lies in the class the floor quantifies over — the standard "the reduction is efficient". It is a
PARAMETER, in the open, at the use site, because this tree has no cost model (`FloorGames` §8). The
floor is priced exactly by §1 (⊤ FALSE for a compressing family, ⊥ vacuous) and by §4 (at the DEPLOYED
encoder it is refuted outright, for a nameable and fixable reason). -/

    (bucket_adv_le D A) (hCR _ hEff)

/-! ### §3.1 — the CANARY and the positive pole.

A gate that refuses everything is a broken keystone, not a fixed one; a gate that accepts everything is
not a gate. Both are checked. -/

/-- **(CANARY — the keystone does NOT follow from the floor applied at ANOTHER finder.)** Strip the
reduction: try to conclude the equivocator's negligibility from the sponge's collision floor applied at
some OTHER finder `B` rather than the one EXTRACTED from it. It does not go through — `hCR B hB` proves
`Negl` of the WRONG advantage, and only `bucket_adv_le` connects the two games. This tooth was
IMPOSSIBLE to write under the free `Poseidon2SpongeCR` hypothesis, where the consumer's hypothesis and
conclusion were the same object. -/

/-- **THE POSITIVE POLE — the RIGHT floor DOES discharge it.** With the sponge's collision floor at the
EXTRACTED finder the keystone fires. Refusal is discrimination only if acceptance still happens. -/

/-! ## §4 — ⚑ THE DEPLOYED HASH, AT THE NEW FLOOR: REFUTED, AND FOR A FIXABLE REASON.

This is where the cutover earns its keep. `deployedSponge` is the ACTUAL `Storage/Deployed.lean` hash
lifted into the family (its `hashAt` is `poseidon2Hash` at every tag, by `rfl`), and the floor is FALSE
there at any class containing a constant adversary — because `deployed_collides` is a KNOWN collision,
so a finder can simply hardcode it.

⛑ **THE WITNESS MOVED WITH THE 2026-07-26 ENCODER REPAIR, AND THE MOVE IS THE FINDING.** It used to be
the CLAMP pair `([-1], [0])`: a bug. It is now the mod-`p` ALIAS pair `([0], [p])`, because `canonLimb`
is a reduction and those two integers denote ONE BabyBear element. So the game floor is still red at
the deployed encoder, but for a reason that is no longer an implementation defect — it is the wire
admitting integers where the field has residues. That distinction is exactly what a diagnosable floor
buys and what literal injectivity could never draw: it was false at both encoders and could not tell
a bug from a type error at the boundary.

Read the three refutations side by side. Injectivity fails because `List ℤ` is infinite and the image
is not: nothing fixes it. The GAME failed at the CLAMP: fixed, §4.1. The GAME still fails at the
ALIAS: fixable, but at the WIRE (a range check in `contentRootFFI`), not in the hash. -/

/-- **THE DEPLOYED SPONGE, AS THE KEYED FAMILY.** One effective tag (the deployed Poseidon2 is unkeyed;
its domain separation IS its key, and there is exactly one here), whose sponge is literally
`Storage.poseidon2Hash`. -/
def deployedSponge : SpongeDeployment where
  Tag := Unit
  tagFintype := inferInstance
  tagNonempty := inferInstance
  hashAt := fun _ => poseidon2Hash
  deployedTag := ()

/-- **FAITHFULNESS.** The family's instance at the deployed tag IS the deployed hash — definitionally.
So §4's refutation is about the function `Storage.contentRootDeployed` actually calls, not an
idealization of it. -/
theorem deployedSponge_is_poseidon2Hash (n : ℕ) :
    (spongeFamily deployedSponge).H n () = poseidon2Hash := rfl

/-- **THE ALIAS FINDER.** The adversary that simply outputs the collision the deployed encoder hands it
for free: `0` and `p`, two integer spellings of one BabyBear element. It is CONSTANT — no search, no
key-dependence, no oracle: efficient under any cost model this tree could ever adopt.

⛑ Until 2026-07-26 this was the CLAMP finder `([-1], [0])`, and that pair was available because of an
encoder BUG. It has been fixed (`Storage.canonLimb`); this finder is the surviving witness, and it wins
for a structural reason the encoder cannot remove — only the WIRE can (§4.1). -/

/-- **⚑ THE TOOTH — THE GAME FLOOR IS STILL REFUTED AT THE DEPLOYED ENCODER.** For ANY adversary class
containing the constant alias finder, the deployed sponge's collision floor is FALSE: that finder's
advantage is the constant `1`, which is not negligible.

This is the floor doing exactly what a floor must — going RED on a hash that gives a collision away.
The live finding is now narrower than it was, and located somewhere else: the HASH is fine, the WIRE
(`contentRootFFI`, which parses arbitrary `String.toInt?`) admits two spellings of one field element. -/

/-- **⚑ AND THE REFUTATION STILL BITES THE STORAGE KEYSTONE — NARROWER.** An object with `key = 0` and
the same object with `key = p` have the SAME deployed leaf, hence the same content root, while being
DIFFERENT `Object`s. Since `contentRootFFI` accepts arbitrary decimal integers, this ghost object is
reachable across the FFI boundary today.

⚠ Note precisely what this is and is not. As FIELD elements those two keys are equal, so the hash is
behaving correctly; the defect is a TYPE ERROR AT THE WIRE — `Object.key : ℤ` where the encoder's
domain is `ZMod p`. §4.1 gives the recipe. -/

GENUINE sponge collision, which is the guarantee `contentRootDeployed_binds_or_collides` was always
supposed to deliver and which the clamp was stealing.

⚠ The honest limit, restated here so this cannot be read up: this is NOT "the fixed root separates the
pair". `p2compress` is `opaque`, so no theorem in this tree can evaluate the two folds and show their
outputs differ. Separating one exhibited pair would not be injectivity anyway — and injectivity is
UNREACHABLE here (finite `UInt64` image over an infinite domain), which is the whole reason this file
exists. The claim that IS available is the game floor, above. -/

/-! ### §4.1 — the cause, ISOLATED: the clamp WAS an encoder bug, and it is now FIXED.

The point of the whole cutover, in two `decide`s: the pre-fix limb map merged `-1` and `0`, while the
canonical BabyBear reduction separates them. The collision was therefore a property of
`Storage/Deployed.lean`'s limb encoder, not of Poseidon2 — precisely the distinction literal
injectivity could never draw, being false at both encoders.

⛑ **REPAIRED 2026-07-26.** `Storage.canonLimb` is now what `poseidon2Hash` uses. The migration cost was
NIL and that is a theorem-adjacent fact about the Rust side, not an aspiration:
`dregg_poseidon2_2to1` (`circuit/src/storage_ffi.rs:12-16`) already reduces its arguments `% BABYBEAR_P`,
so for every limb `0 ≤ x < 2^64` the old and new encoders feed the primitive the SAME field element and
every root over correctly-encoded data is byte-identical. Only mis-encoded limbs move.

⚑ **WHAT IS STILL OPEN, AND WHERE.** The residual (§4's alias finder) is NOT in the hash and cannot be
fixed there: `canonLimb` is a reduction, so `p`-congruent integers necessarily share a limb, and that is
correct. The defect is that `Object.key/contentType/bodyDigest : ℤ` and `contentRootFFI` parses
arbitrary `String.toInt?`, so the WIRE offers many spellings of one field element. THE RECIPE, named and
deliberately not taken here because it is a wire-contract change and belongs to ember:

  * make `contentRootFFI` reject any parsed limb outside `[0, babyBearP)` and return a value that
    cannot be confused with a root (`"ERR"`, the spelling `lean_mlkem_encaps_real` already uses — NOT
    `"0"`, which is the genuine root of the empty bucket); and
  * state the guarantee conditionally in Lean: on canonical objects the limb map is injective, so the
    alias finder has no canonical witness.

Until that lands, the honest statement is the one §4 proves: at the deployed encoder the collision game
is refuted by a constant finder, so `contentRootDeployed` binds only against callers that range-check
their own limbs. -/

`deployed_collides`, with no Poseidon2 anywhere in sight. -/
theorem preFixLimb_collides : preFixLimb (-1) = preFixLimb 0 := by decide

/-- **THE FIX.** The canonical reduction SEPARATES them, so the old collision was a property of the
encoder and not of the field or of the hash. (This does not prove the fixed hash collision-resistant —
that is the floor, and it is not provable. It proves the CLAMP refutation stops firing.) -/
theorem babyBearLimb_separates : babyBearLimb (-1) ≠ babyBearLimb 0 := by decide

`Storage.poseidon2Hash` now calls. Without this line the two `decide`s above would be a claim about a
function nothing uses — which is exactly what they were before 2026-07-26. -/
theorem babyBearLimb_is_the_deployed_limb : babyBearLimb = Storage.canonLimb := rfl

/-- **AND THE RESIDUAL, AT THE SAME RESOLUTION.** The deployed limb map still merges `0` and `p`. This
is the alias finder's witness at the encoder level, and it is correct field behaviour — see §4.1's
recipe for where it actually has to be closed. -/

/-! ## §5 — ⚑ EVERY MIGRATED THEOREM IS STRICTLY STRONGER.

Two halves, both proved, at the one concrete instantiation the tree has.

  * **NOTHING LOST** — at exactly the hypothesis the deleted theorem assumed, the migrated
    unconditional form yields the deleted theorem's conclusion.
  * **STRICTLY** — that hypothesis is UNAVAILABLE at the deployed hash (`deployed_floor_false`), so the
    deleted theorem delivered nothing there, while the migrated form still delivers its disjunction. -/

/-- **⚑ THE STRENGTHENING, AT THE STORAGE KEYSTONE (half a — NOTHING LOST).** Under the deleted
theorem's OWN hypothesis, the migrated `contentRootDeployed_binds_or_collides` delivers the deleted
theorem's conclusion: two DISTINCT object sets cannot share a deployed content root. So the cutover
surrendered nothing a consumer was entitled to.

**Half (b) — STRICTLY.** That hypothesis is FALSE at the deployed hash
(`DeployedFloorRefuted.deployed_floor_false`, an `rfl` collision), so the deleted theorem delivered
NOTHING there while the migrated form still delivers its disjunction unconditionally. The gap between
the two is not a technicality — it is the whole deployed system. -/

deleted keystone required is UNAVAILABLE at the deployed hash. -/
theorem storage_old_hypothesis_unavailable : ¬ Poseidon2SpongeCR poseidon2Hash :=

/-- The same shape one level down, at the MMR root, RESTATED CONTRAPOSITIVELY (2026-07-28). Two
DISTINCT receipt logs sharing an `mroot` REFUTE the floor outright — so the light-client cone's
migration is auditable by the same criterion, and this declaration assumes no floor content and is
therefore a tooth rather than a carrier.

⚑ WHY IT MOVED. It used to read `(hCR) (h) (hne) : False` and prove it by citing
`MMR.mroot_injective`, a "strength bridge" retained precisely so this auditability claim could be
made. That bridge is DELETED, because — see `mroot_conclusion_false_at_deployed` immediately below —
its CONCLUSION is false at the deployed hash by an `rfl` collision, exactly as its premise is. A
theorem that carries a refuted floor is a carrier whatever its conclusion; a theorem that CONCLUDES a
floor's negation and assumes none is the thing this campaign wants more of. Same claim, honest
spelling. -/

/-! ### ⚑ THE DELETED "STRENGTH BRIDGES" WERE FALSE → FALSE, AND HERE IS THE WITNESS.

`Storage.DeployedFloorRefuted.deployed_collides` is a `rfl` collision of the DEPLOYED sponge at two
distinct SINGLETON preimages, `poseidon2Hash [0] = poseidon2Hash [p]`. That single fact refutes the
CONCLUSION of all three MMR injectivity bridges that stood between 2026-07-25 and 2026-07-28
(`PTree.hashOf_injective`, `bag_injective`, `mroot_injective`), because a one-entry log's root peels
straight down to the singleton absorb (`MMR` §3¼).

This is the measurement the wave-1 lesson asks for — CHECK THE CONCLUSION, NOT ONLY THE HYPOTHESIS.
A bridge whose premise AND conclusion are both refuted where the system stands is not preserving
strength; it is preserving a shape. The three below are the reason the bridges were deleted rather
than kept, and they are `rfl`-cheap, so nothing is being asserted on credit. -/

`mroot_injective` concluded "two logs with equal MMR roots are equal"; at `poseidon2Hash` the
one-entry logs `[0]` and `[p]` are a counterexample, by `rfl`. The honest binding is
`MMR.mroot_binds_or_collides` plus the named `MMR.MRootColl` residual, priced at ~2^15.5 queries by
`RomQueryFloor.birthday_bound` at the 1-felt root. -/
