# Dregg2.Substrate.Heap — THE HEAP's sorted-map semantics (REFINEMENT-DESIGN Decision 1, wave R2).

A cell's programmable state becomes **registers + `heap_root`**: a sorted-Poseidon2 Merkle map over
`(collection_id, key) → value` (`.docs-history-noclaude/REFINEMENT-DESIGN.md` Decision 1). This module is the Lean
SEMANTIC FLOOR of that heap — the openable sorted map the circuit's gates will open against — built
as the GENERALIZATION of the proven `cap_root` machinery with a GENERIC leaf:

  * the SORTED-by-key invariant is the same strict `Pairwise (· < ·)` the non-membership bracketing
    proof rides (`Dregg2.Crypto.NonMembership.Sorted`, the cap/nullifier sorted tree);
  * NON-MEMBERSHIP openings reuse `sorted_gap_excludes` LITERALLY (the proven combinatorial heart of
    the sorted-tree non-membership AIR) — `get_none_of_gap` below is that theorem applied to the
    heap's key list;
  * the ROOT is a recomputed digest of the sorted leaf list, with the same anti-ghost shape
    (`EffectVmEmitCapRoot.capRoot_binds_edge`): equal roots BIND the whole heap. ⚑ **NO FLOOR
    (2026-07-28).** That binding used to assume `Poseidon2SpongeCR` (later spelled
    `Function.Injective`, the same proposition), which is PROVED FALSE at deployed BabyBear. §2.1–§2.2
    carry the two DECIDABLE per-instance residuals that replaced it — `AddrColl` (the frame law) and
    `HeapRootColl` (the anti-ghost) — each with its three poles, plus the hypothesis-free
    `*_or_collides` dichotomies. The honest strength is `≈ 2^15.5` queries at the 1-felt root; see
    §2.2's ⚑ block.

## Layer plan (mirrors the cap-root value model, `circuit/src/cap_root.rs` CanonicalCapTree)

  §1 — the GENERIC sorted map over any `LinearOrder` key: `get` / `set` (= sorted insert-or-update),
       proven: read-after-write, frame (untouched keys preserve openings), sorted-insert correctness
       (sortedness preserved + fresh-key grows by one + present-key updates in place), the
       membership characterization, the bracketing NON-MEMBERSHIP opening, and CANONICITY
       (`ext_get`: two sorted maps with the same lookup semantics are EQUAL — the determinism that
       makes the root a function of the map's MEANING, not its build history).
  §2 — the FELT heap (the deployed shape): addresses are key-hashes `addrOf = hash[coll, key]`
       (the sorted-by-key-hash tree of the design), leaves are `hash[addr, value]`, the root is the
       sponge of the sorted leaf list. Proven: `root_deterministic` (same semantics ⇒ same root,
       pure combinatorics) and `root_injective` (same root ⇒ same heap, under the ONE named CR
       hypothesis) — the two directions of "deterministic openable root", exactly the
       `KeyedCommit.KeyedDigestBindsKeys` discipline with a generic leaf.
  §3 — non-vacuity: concrete witnesses TRUE (reads back, frames, sorted) and FALSE (tampered value
       MOVES the root; absent key reads none) on a computable reference sponge.

The KERNEL face (how this sits beside `RecordKernelState` under the `write` verb's frame
discipline) is `Dregg2.Substrate.HeapKernel` — this module is executor/state-free on purpose.

`get h k = none`. The combinatorial heart is LITERALLY `Crypto.NonMembership.sorted_gap_excludes`
(the proven sorted-tree neighbor-bracketing of the nullifier/cap non-membership AIR), applied to
the heap's key spine — the design's "non-membership openings proven for nullifiers" generalized to

The deployed shape (`REFINEMENT-DESIGN.md` Decision 1): the tree is sorted by KEY-HASH
`addrOf hash coll key = hash[coll, key]` (the `(collection_id, key)` address), the leaf binds the
address AND the value (`hash[addr, value]` — the generic-leaf generalization of the cap leaf
`hash[holder, target, rights, op]`, `EffectVmEmitCapRoot.siteCapEdgeLeaf`), and the root is the
sponge of the sorted leaf list (the `KeyedCommit.keyedDigest` shape). ONE crypto floor:
`Poseidon2SpongeCR` — the SAME named hypothesis the cap-root advance carries. -/

/-- The felt heap: a key-hash-addressed sorted map over the field (`ℤ` here, as everywhere in the
emit layer — the BabyBear felt is the deployment instance). -/
abbrev FeltHeap := List (ℤ × ℤ)

/-- **`addrOf`** — the heap ADDRESS of `(collection_id, key)`: the key-hash the tree is sorted by
(the design's "sorted-by-key-hash"). Distinct addresses ⇐ distinct pairs, under CR. -/
def addrOf (hash : List ℤ → ℤ) (coll key : ℤ) : ℤ := hash [coll, key]

/-- **`leafOf`** — the GENERIC ARITY-2 map leaf: `hash[addr, value]` — the generic-leaf generalization of
the cap-edge leaf (the address pins WHERE, the value pins WHAT; tampering either moves the leaf).

⚠ **THIS WAS DOCUMENTED AS "the heap LEAF" AND IT IS NOT ONE.** The deployed `heap_root` tree became an
INDEXED Merkle tree on 2026-07-12 (`919b2b0b8d`): its leaf is `hash[addr, value, next_addr]`
(`heap_root.rs::HeapLeaf::preimage`, `HEAP_LEAF_ARITY = 3`), modelled by
`Circuit.IndexedMerkleTree.imtLeafHash` and emitted by `Circuit.Emit.HeapOpenEmit.heapLeafInputs`. Under
CR the two are never equal (`Circuit.MapAbsentImtGate.imtLeafHash_ne_heapLeafOf`).

`leafOf` is LIVE and CORRECT at the trees that genuinely are arity-2 — the universal-memory boundary
fold (`Crypto.UMemCodec`; `root = rootWith (leafOf hash)`), the receipt/history index leaf discipline,
and the arity-2 model commitment `Circuit.MapMerkleRoot.mapRoot` (which is the conservativity anchor
`MapDenotationSchema.narrowSchema`, NOT the deployed schema — that is
`MapPaddedDenotation.padImtSchema`). Read the tree before quoting this as "the heap leaf". -/

the cell holds (cell≡circuit identity is BY DEFINITION at this layer — both read THIS function). -/

/-! ### §2.1 — the EXTRACTORS: what the old CR-peeling inductions become when nothing is assumed.

⚑ **THE `Poseidon2SpongeCR` FLOOR IS DELETED FROM THIS SECTION.** It used to be the hypothesis of
`hget_hset_frame`, `map_leaf_injective` and `root_injective`. It is **FALSE at deployed BabyBear
parameters** (`Circuit.HashFloorHonesty.poseidon2SpongeCR_false_babyBear`: the sponge lands in one
bounded field while `List ℤ` is infinite, so collisions exist by pigeonhole), so all three theorems
were **VACUOUSLY TRUE at the deployed hash** — true implications whose hypothesis nothing deployed
satisfies. `#assert_axioms` was blind to it: the proofs were clean; the HYPOTHESIS was the flaw.

What replaces it assumes NOTHING. Each old induction, which used to consume a CR hypothesis to peel a
digest, becomes a total function that LOCATES the colliding pair instead — so an equivocation on the
deployed `heap_root` either forces the heaps equal or HANDS BACK the two distinct lists at which the
sponge actually collides. That is a true theorem at deployed parameters, where the old one was empty.

The probabilistic residual is priced in §2.3 as a real reduction to the deployed sponge's collision
game at an explicit adversary class, on `Crypto.SpongeCarrierReduction`. -/

/-- **THE ADDRESS EXTRACTOR.** Two `(collection, key)` pairs claimed at the same address are handed
back as the two preimages of `addrOf` — a genuine sponge collision whenever the pairs differ. -/
def addrFind (c k c' k' : ℤ) : List ℤ × List ℤ := ([c, k], [c', k'])

/-- **THE ADDRESS EXTRACTOR IS CORRECT — unconditionally.** Distinct `(collection, key)` pairs

`Circuit.HashFloorHonesty.poseidon2SpongeCR_false_babyBear` PROVES FALSE at deployed BabyBear. So the
theorem was VACUOUS where the system stands, and so was its CONCLUSION: over ALL `(coll, key)` pairs
"writing one leaves another alone" is refuted by exactly the pigeonhole that refutes the premise

/-! ### §2.2 — ⚑ THE HEAP-ROOT RESIDUAL, AND ITS THREE POLES.

`HeapRootColl hash h₁ h₂` is the ONE named side condition that replaced the floor binder in
`root_injective`, `root_binds_get` and every Deos house-capacity keystone downstream of them
(`Vault`, `PrepaidLease`, `StandingObligation`, `SealedEscrow`, `DerivedCell`).

Three poles, because a side condition that can never fail is `True` in disguise and one that can
never be discharged is a broken keystone rather than a repaired one.

⚑ **THE HONEST ROM NUMBER: ~2^15.5 — A BREAK, NOT A BOUND.** `root hash : FeltHeap → ℤ` is ONE
BabyBear felt at every heap length; the heap widens the ABSORBED PREIMAGE (one leaf digest per
entry), never the DIGEST, and nothing here is `Digest8`-valued. So on
`Crypto.RomQueryFloor.birthday_bound`'s honest rung the residual is `(Q² + 1) / ‖R‖` at
`‖R‖ = babyBearP ≈ 2^30.9`: **≈ 2^15.5 queries.** Every keystone that threads this residual binds
exactly as well as a 31-bit commitment allows, and no better. The ~2^123.5 rung belongs to

/-! ## §2.3 — ⚑ THE DEPLOYED HEAP-ROOT ANTI-GHOST, AS A SECURITY REDUCTION.

This is the HEADLINE binding of the `heap_root` register, and it replaces `root_injective` in that
role. The difference from what it replaces is not presentational:

  * `root_injective` assumed the deployed sponge is injective. It is not, at BabyBear — so that
    theorem is VACUOUS at deployed parameters and transports nothing.
  * A `binds ∨ collides` disjunction would not fix it either: a collision EXISTS by pigeonhole, so the
    disjunction is satisfiable through its right branch without binding ever holding. It quantifies
    over SOLUTIONS.
  * The reduction below quantifies over EFFICIENT ADVERSARIES, which is what cryptographic hardness
    actually quantifies over. An adversary that keeps the published `heap_root` while tampering ANY
    address or ANY value is turned, by `rootFind`, into a genuine collision finder for the deployed
    sponge — so its advantage is negligible under the deployed sponge's collision floor.

⚑ **THE FLOOR DISCIPLINE (07-23).** The `Eff := IsPolyTime` discharge this section used to export
(`heapRoot_binds_from_polyTime` / `heapFrame_binds_from_polyTime`) is DELETED:
`Exec.SystemRootsBindingReduction.sysRoots_floor_polyTime_false_babyBear` REFUTES
`HashCRHardQuant (spongeFamily D) (IsPolyTime …)` at the deployed sponge, and
`Crypto.RomBindingReduction`'s header proves the fixed-function game cannot be repaired by ANY class.
What remains here is the honest fixed-hash form with `hEff` in the open (`_advantage_bound`); the
DISCHARGED binding lives on the keyed-ROM floor — §2.4 for the ADDRESS CODEC (a one-query
commitment, mechanically re-pointed), while the ROOT is a FOLD commitment (`hash` of `leafOf hash`
digests, one inner query per leaf) that the one-query `RomCarrier` shape does NOT cover: its ROM
re-grounding needs a fold/vector carrier with a first-differing-leaf extractor, NAMED OPEN WORK, not
silently claimed.

⚑ **THE ~31-BIT BOUNDARY IS NOT CLOSED BY THIS, AND MUST NOT BE READ AS CLOSED.** `heap_root` is ONE
felt. The floor bounds an adversary's advantage in a collision game; at a ~31-bit digest that game is
winnable in ~2^15.5 work by birthday search, so the honest reading of every binding here is "binds
exactly as well as its width allows". Widening the carrier is a separate, still-open repair. -/

/-- **THE HEAP-ROOT CARRIER.** No context; the payload is the whole heap; the commitment is the
deployed `root`; the extractor is `rootFind`, with its unconditional spec and its proved output
bound. Everything a deployed 1-felt commitment site owes the spine, and nothing more. -/

/-! ## §2.4 — ⚑ THE ADDRESS CODEC, DISCHARGED ON THE KEYED-ROM FLOOR.

The one-query re-pointing of the frame law, on `Crypto.RomCarrierSites`' kit. ⚑ THE MODELLING STEP,
STATED: the sampled `H : Tag × AddrPair → Fin (2 ^ l)` idealises the deployed
`sponge (tagCode t ++ [coll, key])` at an asymptotic digest width — a deliberate, labelled ROM
idealisation (the `RomCarrierSites` header names exactly what it buys and does not buy); the message
domain is the BabyBear-RANGE pair, lossless on every pair the deployed prover can absorb
(`truncAddr_inj`, `truncAddr_limbs`). The floor under the binding is
`KeyedRomFloor.keyedRom_hard` — the birthday bound, PROVED — where the deleted discharge carried a
refuted hypothesis. At the deployed ~31-bit width the honest reading remains §2.3's: binds as well
as the width allows. -/
