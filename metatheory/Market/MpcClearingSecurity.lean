# Market.MpcClearingSecurity — exact `(p*, V*)` leakage for volume-argmax clearing

This module joins the actual fhEgg clearing semantics to the output-boundary MPC
security statement.  The runtime rule is

    p* = FhEggClearing.crossing bk K
    V* = FhEggClearing.clearedVolume bk K

where `crossing` is the LOWEST bucket maximizing `min demand supply`.  The public
deterministic view contains only `(p*, V*)` plus public circuit shape.  In
particular it contains no balance sign vector and does not use `balanceCrossing`.

The public shape is `(K, b)` — `K` price buckets, `b`-bit values — and EVERY size
in the transcript is derived from it by the accounting transcribed from `mpc.rs`
in §2.  Nothing here takes a transcript size as an input.

PROVEN here:

* additive n-of-n shares are perfectly hiding from every coalition missing one
  party, with full-collusion teeth;
* the real deterministic view factors exactly through the volume-argmax leakage;
* DATA-OBLIVIOUSNESS: every transcript size is a function of `(K,b)` alone, so
  swapping the private book moves nothing the world can see — this used to be
  the hypothesis `hm` and is now `transcript_sizes_depend_only_on_shape`;
* the opened `p*` field is exactly wide enough for every bucket;
* same-leakage books have identical views, while a private curve coefficient and
  the obsolete balance sign do not factor through that leakage;
* the same clearing is conserving, uniform-price optimal, volume maximizing, and
  reveal-only;
* MaskedBoundaryParty's mod-t row identity reconstructs the hidden coefficient,
  and any correct A2B bit representation denotes that same reconstruction;
* generic reveal-only stages compose, and the exact view instantiates PerfectZK.

HONEST SCOPE: this is the semi-honest, perfect-hiding algebra.  Authentication,
malicious-share validity, dealer-free triples, smudging-to-full-transcript hybrids,
and adaptive/UC composition remain outside this theorem.  The A2B bridge specifies
semantic reconstruction; it does not pretend to verify the Rust gate schedule.

⚠ And say plainly what `reveal_only` is: it is `rfl`, and it stays `rfl`.  The view
is DEFINED as the simulation, so that equation is true by construction and is not
where the content lives.  What changed in the §2 rework is what it is definitional
ABOUT — the sizes are now the deployed circuit's, forced, instead of a free field
that any number satisfied.  The load-bearing statements are the ones that are NOT
definitional: `transcript_sizes_depend_only_on_shape` (was the hypothesis `hm`),
`pStar_fits_idxBits`, `maskedOpens_three_never_144`, the satisfiable/refutable pair
`maskedOpens_factors_through_leakage` + `book_reading_size_refutes_factorization`,
and the measured Rust pin.  A reader who cites `reveal_only` alone is citing a
definition.

/-! ### The deployed circuit shape and its EXACT transcript accounting.

`mpc.rs` fixes the SIZE of every public transcript field as a function of the
PUBLIC shape `(K, b)` alone — `K` price buckets, `b`-bit values.  That is the
load-bearing fact behind `mpc.rs::simulate` ("the argmax runs the SAME gate count
on every input (data-oblivious), so that count depends only on `(k, b)`"), and it
is transcribed here so the simulator DERIVES the transcript's size instead of
being handed it.

⚠ What this replaced: `MpcView`/`MpcClearing` used to carry `maskedLen : ℕ` as a
FREE FIELD and `mpcSim` took it as an INPUT.  So "the view is simulable from the
leakage plus public shape" fed the simulator the one number whose independence
from the private book was the thing to prove, and `same_leakage_indistinguishable`
took that independence as the hypothesis `hm`.  Nothing in the model could see
that the only two witnesses in the tree both hand-picked `maskedLen := 144`, a
length the deployed circuit cannot emit at `K = 3` for ANY bit width
(`maskedOpens_three_never_144` below).

Each definition names the Rust it mirrors.  The concrete numbers are pinned
against a REAL `mpc_crossing` run in `fhegg-fhe/tests/mpc_lean_transcript_pin.rs`
— two independent sources (this arithmetic model vs. the circuit's measured
behaviour), so a disagreement is a red gate rather than decoration. -/

⚠ This is an obligation that only became STATEABLE once `b` existed.  `pStar` and

circuit computes them on `b`-bit shares and wraps.  Without this field an
`MpcClearing` could carry `b = 1` over a book with `demand = 10` and still claim
its `(p*,V*)` was the deployed output — so introducing `b` unaccompanied would
