# Market.PrivateBookBfvNttFamily -- one exact NTT family target

`PrivateBookBfvSliceDescriptor` proves one of the 98,304 production BFV
coefficient equations with a 4,096-term schoolbook accumulator.  Instantiating
that descriptor literally would therefore commit 98,304 independent proofs and
402,653,184 accumulator rows.  This file fixes the next Lean-first lowering:

* one per-session public-key NTT certificate (six transforms), reusable by all
  private books under that key;
* one per-book family trace containing twelve shared-`u` forward transforms,
  twenty-four ciphertext inverse transforms, all 98,304 pointwise products, and
  all 98,304 terminal error/message/quotient equations; and
* one recursively folded wire proof binding the key certificate, the existing
  private-book proof, and the family trace.

The row schedule is deliberately not a random projection.  Every RNS row and
every output coefficient occurs exactly once at the pointwise and terminal
boundaries.  The live per-book schedule is 1,032,192 rows and pads to 2^20,
versus 402,653,184 schoolbook term rows (exactly 384 times the padded family
height).  Public-key preprocessing is another 147,456 live rows, padded to
2^18, but is paid once per key rather than once per private book.

This module is isolated from the Rust descriptor registry while the 14-bit limb
butterfly is lowered.  It supplies the exact shape, the semantic contract back
to `WgpuBfvNttSpec.negacyclicMul`, and an executable two-production-modulus,
eight-coefficient odd-NTT gate with positive and mutation teeth.  A descriptor
fingerprint will be added only after the emitted AIR and Rust witness builder
exist; JSON identity is not used here as evidence of semantic refinement.

The odd powers of a primitive `2N`-th root are precisely the evaluation points
for `R_q[X]/(X^N+1)`.  These definitions are executable and intentionally use
`ZMod q`, so there is no lossy BabyBear embedding in the semantic layer.

must ensure `n` is invertible and `psi` has exact order `2n`; the concrete gate
below checks the resulting equality rather than assuming it. -/

This is intentionally larger than a one-coefficient arithmetic example.  It
runs the complete odd forward transforms, pointwise products, and inverse
transforms for all eight coefficients under the first two *production* BFV
moduli, compares every result with the independent schoolbook negacyclic
reference, and binds a claimed output packet.  One changed coefficient rejects.

/-! ## 4. Exact residual manifest

This file fixes the target and closes the semantic compositions available
before emission.  It does **not** claim the production family is already a
mintable proof.  The remaining implementation/proof obligations are exactly:

1. emit the radix-`2^14` butterfly AIR, including canonical residues, quotient
   limbs, bounded carries, stage routing, and first/last-stage twists;
2. build the honest family witness and its cross-stage permutation/lookup bus;
3. emit both terminal coefficient equations per final row, including signed
   error, exact SIMD message, canonical ciphertext, and integer quotient gates;
4. emit the six-transform public-key certificate and recursively join its
   spectrum root to the per-book family proof;
5. prove `OddNttRefines` for the production degree/root table (the three
   `psi^4096 = -1` executable teeth above are necessary root checks, not by
   themselves the Fourier orthogonality/refinement theorem); and
6. drive the same scheduled transforms through the portable wgpu prover path,
   with CPU/reference parity, wrong-root, wrong-stage, wrong-modulus, and
   changed-coefficient refusal tests.

Until all six close, `oddNtt_family_yields_exact_private_book_bfv_opening`
correctly retains `OddNttRefines` as an explicit premise.
