# Market.RevealNothing — the fhEgg REVEAL-NOTHING theorem: `View ≈ Sim∘Q` over the leakage functor `Q`.

**Component 3 of `docs/deos/SHIELDED-DREX-ASSURANCE-ROADMAP.md` — THE CRUX and the differentiator
("nobody learns what settled").** This module states, and discharges the *tractable core* of, the
zero-knowledge / reveal-nothing property of a shielded clearing, on the finalized N-leg
ring-clearing transcript `[nf, root, vb]ⁿ` (`circuit-prove/src/shielded_ring_clearing_nleg_air.rs`)
and the just-proven clearing cores (`Market/FhEggClearing.lean`, `Market/CertF.lean`).

## The honest statement (codex's key correction, `docs/deos/FHEGG-CODEX-INSIGHTS.md` Q2)

The reveal-nothing property is **NOT** "the transcript is independent of the trades" — that is false
(the transcript reveals the batch cleared, the price, the conserved totals). The honest statement is a
**simulator natural transformation over a LEAKAGE FUNCTOR `Q`**:

    ∃ Sim,  View(clearing) ≈ Sim(Q(clearing))

— the public transcript is *simulatable from the public leakage `Q` alone*, so an observer (including
the operator) learns only `Q` — the fairness + the clearing price + the conserved totals + the batch
size — and **nothing about the individual trades** (who / value / offer-want / the allocation).

`Q` (`Market.RevealNothing.Q`) is the PUBLIC leakage of a clearing: the clearing price, the batch size
`N`, the conserved total `Σ value` (public by conservation, `CertF`/`FhEggClearing`), and the public
committed tree root (the anonymity set). It is explicitly NOT the per-leg owner / value / offer / want
/ allocation, all of which are witness-only under the hiding PCS.

The `≈` is stated HONESTLY per codex's note:
  * **statistical** for the PCS / hiding layer (Pedersen perfect hiding, `HidingFriPcs` statistical-ZK);
  * **computational** for the whole system (hash-hiding of the deployed Poseidon2 `value_binding`,
    nullifier-unlinkability).

## What is PROVEN here (the tractable core) vs the NAMED FLOOR

**PROVEN (unconditional Lean, kernel-clean):**
  * **(1) The `View ≈ Sim∘Q` theorem and its content** — from a bundle carrying the reveal-nothing law,
    `RevealBundle.reveal_nothing` (`View c = Sim (Q c)`), `RevealBundle.view_factors_through_leakage`
    (the view factors through `Q` — the categorical natural-transformation form), and the marquee
    `RevealBundle.same_leakage_indistinguishable`: **two clearings with the SAME leakage `Q` but
    DIFFERENT private trades produce the SAME transcript** (the same-leakage-class indistinguishability
    codex named). This is the reveal-nothing consequence, derived exactly as `PerfectZK`'s
    `view_indep_of_witness` is derived from `view = sim s`.
  * **(2a) Value-binding HIDING** (`HidingValueBinding`) — the *statistical/perfect* hiding core:
    for a blinded commitment the randomness absorbs the value, so any two values have colliding
    openings (`value_hidden`), reducing the "the `vb` lane reveals nothing about `value`" obligation
    to a named hiding carrier; witnessed by the additive/Pedersen `addHVB` (perfect hiding) and with
    teeth (`leakyVB_not_hiding`: a commitment that ignores its blinder leaks the value).
  * **(2c) The SIMULATOR SHELL** (`canonicalSim`, `shellBundle`) — a concrete witness-free transcript
    generator built from `Q` alone, PROVEN `Q`-faithful (`canonicalSim_batchSize`,
    `canonicalSim_price`: it emits the right batch size and price from the leakage). The shell bundle
    is a coherent `RevealBundle` (the ideal/simulator world), on which the same-leakage
    indistinguishability holds by construction and NON-VACUOUSLY (`shell_indistinguishable` on two
    genuinely different clearings `c_alpha ≠ c_beta` with equal `Q`).
  * **(4) Teeth** — `leaky_no_simulator`: a transcript that leaks a private value verbatim admits NO
    simulator satisfying the reveal-nothing law, so the law is a *genuine, falsifiable constraint*, not
    a vacuous `True` (the dual of `PerfectZK.leaky_no_simulator`).
  * **Bridge** — `RevealBundle.toPerfectZK` transports the bundle onto the repo's
    `Metatheory.Open.PerfectZK` machinery, so `reveal_nothing` is literally `PerfectZK`'s
    `view_indep_of_witness` on the ring-clearing transcript (`real_view_eq_perfectZK_floor`).

**NAMED FLOOR (graded, an explicit structure FIELD — NOT a `sorry`, NOT proven):**
  * `RevealBundle.reveal_law` is the reveal-nothing law as a *bundle field*. For the DEPLOYED bundle
    (whose `view` is the real Poseidon2/FRI transcript) this field is the **`HidingFriPcs`
    statistical-ZK + hash-hiding + nullifier-unlinkability** floor — the PCS simulator object, which is
    not yet a Lean theorem. We do NOT construct that deployed bundle; every reveal-nothing consequence
    above is *conditional on a bundle satisfying `reveal_law`*, exactly the way the linking tower's
    forgery bound is conditional on `HashCR`. The `shellBundle` satisfies `reveal_law` by construction
    (the ideal world); the deployed bundle satisfies it only under the named floor.

## HONEST GRADE

Reveal-nothing at the clearing level is **`zk-clearing`, conditional on the `HidingFriPcs`
statistical-ZK floor** (the PCS simulator), the same shape the linking tower is `HashCR`-conditional.
The tractable core (the `View ≈ Sim∘Q` statement, the same-leakage indistinguishability *from the
law*, the perfect value-binding hiding, the `Q`-faithful simulator shell, the teeth) is PROVEN and
kernel-clean; the full statistical-ZK simulator of the deployed FRI PCS is the NAMED, un-`sorry`-ed
floor. Do NOT read this as "reveal-nothing is proved" — it is proved *conditional on the PCS-ZK floor*.

codex named).** Two clearings with the SAME public leakage `Q` — but arbitrarily DIFFERENT private
trades (different owners, values, offers, allocations, as long as price / batch size / conserved total

only the leakage class `Q`; the private trades within a class are indistinguishable. This is the

the roots the public root, the `vb`s hiding commitments consistent with the conserved total), the
proof as an opaque digest, the public price. This is the witness-free `Sim` of the theorem — it never

the reveal-nothing law holds BY CONSTRUCTION (`reveal_law := rfl`). This witnesses that the simulator
shell is a *coherent* reveal-nothing object (the positive polarity): on it, `reveal_nothing` and
`same_leakage_indistinguishable` are unconditional. The DEPLOYED bundle (real Poseidon2/FRI `view`)
differs only in that its `reveal_law` is the NAMED statistical-ZK floor rather than `rfl`. -/

mistake the reveal-nothing law forbids: the transcript now depends on the private trade, not just on
`Q`. -/
def leakyView (c : Clearing) : Transcript where
  lanes := []

/-- **`leaky_no_simulator` — the reveal-nothing law is a GENUINE, FALSIFIABLE constraint.** No
simulator `Sim : Leakage → Transcript` can satisfy `leakyView c = Sim (Q c)` for all `c`: α and β have
the SAME leakage `Q` but leak DIFFERENT first values (`3 ≠ 4`), so any such `Sim` would force
`leakyView α = Sim (Q α) = Sim (Q β) = leakyView β`, i.e. `3 = 4`. Hence a leaky transcript CANNOT be
packaged as a `RevealBundle` — `reveal_law` is not vacuously satisfiable. (The dual of
`PerfectZK.leaky_no_simulator`, on the ring-clearing transcript.) -/

named. -/

/-- **`HidingValueBinding` — a HIDING value-binding carrier.** A commitment `vb : value → asset →
blinder → digest` with the **hiding law**: any two values have colliding openings (some choice of
blinders makes the commitments equal), so the published `vb` reveals nothing about `value`. For the
Pedersen/additive model this is PERFECT (information-theoretic) hiding — the blinder absorbs the value
— hence quantum-safe. For the DEPLOYED Poseidon2 `value_binding = hash_fact(value, [asset,
randomness, 0])` the hiding is COMPUTATIONAL (hash-hiding), NAMED here as the `hiding` field. (Its
BINDING facet — injectivity on the opening, under `HashCR` — is the separate
`RealCrypto.ValueBindingCommit`; binding and hiding are the two facets of the one commitment.) -/

  hides : ∀ (v v' a : ℤ), ∃ r r', vb v a r = vb v' a r'

/-- **The value hidden** — restatement: for any two values `v, v'` the value-binding admits equal
openings, so an observer of `vb` learns nothing about `value` (the reduction of the `vb`-lane leakage
obligation to the named hiding carrier). -/

/-- **`addHVB` — the additive/Pedersen PERFECT-hiding witness (non-vacuity).** `vb v a r = v + a + r`:
the blinder absorbs the value, so choosing `r' = r + v − v'` collides any two values. This is the
information-theoretic hiding of a Pedersen commitment (the group-element facet, where `r` is uniform),
inhabiting the carrier non-vacuously. -/
def addHVB : HidingValueBinding where
  vb v a r := v + a + r
  hides v v' a := ⟨0, v - v', by ring⟩

/-- **The perfect-hiding facet is NOT binding** — mirroring `RealCrypto.refVC_not_binding`: the
additive `vb` collapses distinct openings (`vb 8 0 3 = vb 3 0 8 = 11`). This is the HIDING facet
(perfect hiding, NOT binding); the BINDING facet is `RealCrypto.ValueBindingCommit` (injective under
`HashCR`). Two facets of the one Pedersen/Poseidon2 commitment, modeled separately and honestly. -/
theorem addHVB_hiding_not_binding : addHVB.vb 8 0 3 = addHVB.vb 3 0 8 := by decide

/-- **TEETH — a value-binding that IGNORES its blinder is NOT hiding.** `vb v a r = v` publishes the
value verbatim, so `value_hidden` FAILS (values `0` and `1` never collide). Hence the `hiding` field
is a genuine constraint, not a vacuous `True` — a real commitment must actually blind. -/
