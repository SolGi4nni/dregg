# Market.WideCommitBoundary — the faithful eight-lane light-client boundary.

The generic circuit apex historically collapsed a deployed state commitment to one `ℤ`.
This module keeps the deployed shape: the commitment is the eight-felt result of the
`wireCommitR8` chain over a `rotatedNumPreLimbs`-limb kernel payload, with the receipt-log root absorbed
last.  The payload's first limb is the already-proved `CommitSurface.commit`; the
remaining 183 lanes are domain-separated headroom for the deployed layout.  Thus the
wide chain adds no new trust: the wide commitment recovers the entire payload and receipt
root, then `CommitSurface.commit_binds` recovers the kernel.

## ⚑ THE HEADLINE BINDING IS A SECURITY REDUCTION, not a disjunction (§R).

The anchor `turn/src/state_commit.rs` consumes is the wide `STATE_COMMIT` carrier
(`wireCommitR8` / `wire_commit_8_chip`).  Its binding used to be exported as the bare
disjunction `stateDecode8_pre_faithful : pre = pre' ∨ WireColl …` — the extraction-as-data
keystone that replaced the FALSE `Poseidon2WideCR` injectivity.  That was true at deployed
BabyBear parameters (unlike injectivity), but it is still a SHIRK: a collision EXISTS at
those parameters by pigeonhole (`VacuitySweepTeeth.widePerm_not_injective_babyBear`), so
`binds ∨ collides` is satisfiable through the `collides` branch WITHOUT `binds` ever
holding.  It NAMES the floor; it does not STAND on it.  It quantifies over SOLUTIONS
(a collision exists), where cryptographic hardness quantifies over EFFICIENT ADVERSARIES.

§R rebuilds it with the correct structure — a SECURITY REDUCTION to a NAMED hardness
assumption over EFFICIENT ADVERSARIES:

  * the honest floor is `FloorGames.HashCRHardQuant (wideFamily D) Eff` — a real collision
    game of the deployed wide permutation at an explicit adversary class `Eff`, negligible
    advantage.  It is NOT injectivity (false), NOT `∃ collision` (a solution).  Both poles
    are proved in `InjectiveFloorRegrounded` §3.6: `Eff := ⊤` is FALSE at deployed BabyBear
    params (the honest price of `hEff`), `Eff := ⊥` is vacuous.
  * a state-endpoint forgery is a first-class `Game` (`stateCommitBreakGame`): the adversary
    wins iff it outputs two chained states whose wide-chain inputs DIFFER yet publish the
    SAME eight-felt commit.  `stateDecode8_forgery_is_break` ties it to the deployed
    `StateDecode8` decode object.
  * the reduction (`stateCommit_binds_advantage_bound`) is the EXTRACTOR as a map of
    adversaries: a state forgery → (`stateBreakToWireBreak`) a wire-commit equivocation →
    (`wireBreakToFinder`, via `wireCommit8Find`) a genuine `permW` collision.  Under the
    named floor with the `hEff` obligation on the composed finder, a state forgery has
    NEGLIGIBLE advantage.  The `_binds_or_collides` extractor is the reduction's INTERNAL
    witness, NOT the headline.

The exact-Prop `stateDecode8_pre_faithful`/`_post_faithful` are RETAINED below as the
deterministic backbone (they are what the win relation rests on), explicitly demoted from
"the deployed binding" to "the exact-Prop skeleton".

## ⚑ THE CROSS-LAYER BRIDGE, and what remains (named, not faked).

The reduction closes the WIDE component of the anchor binding.  A state forgery whose wide
inputs AGREE while the states differ is NOT caught by the wide floor — it is a collision of
the receipt-root sponge — ⚑ as of 2026-08-01 that leg is no longer the refuted floor
`Poseidon2SpongeCR hash` but the per-instance `SpongeColl hash (receiptRootFind hash L L')`, a
FOURTH named disjunct at the exact-Prop backbone, worth ≈2^15.5 queries at the 1-felt root — or of
the kernel commit (`CommitSurface.commit_binds`, its own field).
Those are the SEPARATELY-priced residuals, named at `stateDecode8_pre_faithful`.  What is
NOT yet closed: the exact-Prop AIR layer and the computational game layer are still bridged
per-instance (the game samples a tag; the deployed trace fixes `deployedTag`).

`Eff` at the discharge site: an earlier §P instantiated it at
`Dregg2.Crypto.CostAdversary.IsPolyTime` and derived the composed finder's efficiency — but
that floor is REFUTED HERE (§P, `stateCommit_floor_polyTime_false_babyBear`): `IsPolyTime`
prices answer SIZE, so the `Classical.choice` adversary answering every sampled tag with a
short collision that EXISTS by pigeonhole is in the class and wins with probability `1`.
The discharged theorem was therefore VACUOUS at deployed BabyBear parameters, and it is
DELETED.  The honest discharge is §Q/§S: the chain is modeled as an ORACLE COMPUTATION —
each absorption step a `query` node (`wireCommitComp`, eval-equal to the deployed
`wireCommitR8`) — and the binding is re-grounded on the KEYED, QUERY-COUNTED sampled-oracle
floor (`KeyedRomFloor.keyedRom_hard`, the birthday bound, a THEOREM), where the
choice-answerer is PROVABLY excluded.  ⚑ That re-grounding is a MODELLING step (the standard
random-oracle idealization of the deployed sponge at an asymptotic digest width — `hw`
demands `|R l| = 2^l`, unsatisfiable by the fixed 31-bit BabyBear felt), taken deliberately
and LABELLED in §S, not smuggled.  §R's general `stateCommit_binds_advantage_bound` keeps
the `Eff`/`hEff` parameters, since it is the statement at an arbitrary adversary class.

No axiom, `sorry`, `admit`, or native decision procedure.

⚑ **THE RECEIPT-ROOT RESIDUAL IS NOW A FOURTH DISJUNCT TOO (2026-08-01).**  It used to be
`hReceiptCR : Poseidon2SpongeCR hash` — the 1-felt receipt-root sponge's injectivity, which
`Circuit.HashFloorHonesty.poseidon2SpongeCR_false_babyBear` PROVES FALSE at deployed parameters, so
this theorem was vacuous on that leg exactly as it had been on the wide-CR and kernel-commit legs.
It is now `SpongeColl hash (receiptRootFind hash pre.log pre'.log)`: the deployed receipt sponge
collided at the SPECIFIC pair a TOTAL extractor hands back for THESE two logs — the same kind of
object as `WireColl` and `S.CommitColl` beside it, priced rather than assumed away.  The theorem now
carries NO floor at all.  ⚑ HONEST PRICE: one BabyBear felt, so ≈2^15.5 queries — a BREAK, not a
security level; the port makes that visible where the floor had hidden it.

that word was the wound: `commit_binds` consumed the four `CommitSurface` injectivity FIELDS, each
FALSE at deployed BabyBear width by pigeonhole, so the "unconditional" leg was VACUOUS and this
theorem inherited it.  The first repair made the third disjunct `S.StateBreak` — but that is a GLOBAL
collision existential over the frame sponge, which pigeonhole SUPPLIES at every BabyBear-bounded
sponge, so the whole disjunction became `True` and the theorem was vacuous a second time.  The third
disjunct is now `S.CommitColl pre.kernel pre'.kernel pc.turn`: the kernel-surface primitives collide
at the SPECIFIC argument pairs the binding visits — the same kind of object as `WireColl` beside it,
priced rather than free.  The shape is: the endpoints agree, OR the deployed wide permutation
equivocated at a named pair, OR the kernel surface collided at a named pair. -/

/-! ## §R — the state-commit anchor binding, as a SECURITY REDUCTION.

⚑ **THE HEADLINE.** This section replaces the bare `_binds_or_collides` disjunction as the deployed
binding of the wide `STATE_COMMIT` carrier (`turn/src/state_commit.rs`).  The disjunction quantified
over SOLUTIONS ("a collision exists"); this reduction quantifies over EFFICIENT ADVERSARIES ("every
`Eff`-adversary that forges the state commit finds a `permW` collision, negligible under the floor").
The extractors (`wireCommit8Find` → `wireBreakToFinder`) are the reduction's WITNESS, not the export.

The wide layer reuses the `InjectiveFloorRegrounded` §3 machinery whole: `wideFamily` (the deployed
`single_perm_compress` as a keyed collision family), `wireCommitBreakGame` (the wire-commit
equivocation game), `wire_adv_le` (its advantage ≤ the extracted collision-finder's), and
`wireCommitR8_binds_advantage_bound` (the reduction to `HashCRHardQuant (wideFamily D) Eff`).  What
§R ADDS is the STATE ENDPOINT: the game whose answers are chained states decoding to a published
commit, and the map of adversaries lifting it onto the wire game. -/

/-- **THE STATE-COMMIT FORGERY GAME.** The adversary is handed a sampled domain-separation tag and
WINS iff it outputs two chained states whose wide-chain inputs `(kernelPayload, receiptRoot)` DIFFER
yet publish the SAME eight-felt wide commitment — i.e. it breaks the anchor's binding on the deployed
`wireCommitR8`.  The break is IN the win relation; the wide-input inequality is the honest side
condition that makes this a WIDE forgery (a state equivocation whose wide inputs AGREE is a receipt- or
kernel-commit collision, priced elsewhere). -/

/-- **⚑ THE REDUCED ANCHOR BINDING — from the wide permutation's collision floor, VIA the reduction.**

Under the DEPLOYED `single_perm_compress`'s collision floor at the class `Eff`, a state-commit forger
whose extracted (state → wire → collision) finder is in that class has NEGLIGIBLE advantage: the
faithful eight-felt state anchor binds the whole wide-chain input (payload + receipt root) except with
negligible probability.  This is the REDUCTION that replaces the bare `_binds_or_collides` disjunction
as the headline binding of the deployed `STATE_COMMIT` carrier.

The advantage inequality is `state_adv_le` (state forger → wire equivocator); the wire → collision
composition and the floor closure both live INSIDE `wireCommitR8_binds_advantage_bound` (which itself
composes `InjectiveFloorRegrounded.wire_adv_le`), so this domination step is the single new layer.

⚑ `hEff` is UNDISCHARGED — the standard "the reduction is efficient", a PARAMETER, in the open, on the
COMPOSED finder `wireBreakToFinder D (stateBreakToWireBreak … A)`.  It CANNOT be honestly discharged
over THIS game: §P proves the floor at `Eff := IsPolyTime` FALSE at deployed BabyBear parameters, and
no query-counted class repairs a FIXED-function game either (the function is public — a bounded
adversary brute-forces it; `RomBindingReduction` header).  The honest discharge moves the GAME to the
sampled-oracle model — §Q/§S.  The floor here is priced by §R's two poles below: `⊤` FALSE at deployed
BabyBear params, `⊥` vacuous. -/

/-- **⚑ THE ⊤ POLE — the floor is FALSE at the REAL BabyBear parameters** (the honest price of `hEff`).
Re-exported from `InjectiveFloorRegrounded.wide_floor_top_false_babyBear`: an eight-lane squeeze into
bounded lanes has finite range while `List ℤ` is infinite, so a collision exists at every tag and the
floor at `Eff := ⊤` is FALSE.  What the reduction buys is not a floor the deployed permutation
satisfies at ⊤ — no such floor exists — it is that the residual is ONE named parameter with both poles
proved, in place of an unclosed disjunction whose right branch is unconditionally available. -/

some OTHER finder `B`, not the one EXTRACTED from the forger.  It does not go through — only
`state_adv_le`/`wire_adv_le` connect the extracted finder to the state game.  A disjunction whose right
branch is always available would carry no more content than `True`; this tooth reds if a future edit
reconnects the games. -/

/-! ## §P — the `IsPolyTime` discharge is REFUTED, and the theorem that carried it is GONE.

⚑ **WHAT STOOD HERE.** `stateCommit_binds_from_polyTime` instantiated §R's `Eff` at
`Dregg2.Crypto.CostAdversary.IsPolyTime` and PROVED the composed finder stays in that class — the
efficiency bookkeeping was real, and its output-growth lemmas remain below.  But the floor it then
consumed,

    HashCRHardQuant (wideFamily D) (IsPolyTime (hashAnsSize D)),

is **FALSE at deployed BabyBear parameters**, and this section now PROVES that
(`stateCommit_floor_polyTime_false_babyBear`) by the same construction that felled the sponge floor
(`Exec.SystemRootsBindingReduction.sysRoots_floor_polyTime_false_babyBear`): `IsPolyTime` prices the
answer's SIZE, never the difficulty of finding it, so the `Classical.choice` adversary that answers
every sampled tag with a two-limb collision — which EXISTS, by pigeonhole, in the fixed compressing
wide permutation — is in the class and wins with probability `1`.  A binding conditioned on a refuted
floor asserts nothing at the deployed hash; it was VACUOUS, and it is DELETED rather than retained as
costume.  Its honest successor is §Q/§S: the same reduction shape over a game whose hash is a SAMPLED
ORACLE the adversary can only QUERY, where the floor is a theorem (`KeyedRomFloor.keyedRom_hard`) and
the choice-answerer is PROVABLY excluded.

The extractor output-size facts (`chunk31_len_le`, `chainCollFind_len_le`, `wireCommit8Find_len_le`)
are RETAINED: true deployed-width facts about the chain walk, independent of the cost model that used
to consume them. -/

/-! ## §Q — the deployed chain, AS AN ORACLE COMPUTATION.

⚑ **THE MODEL THE RE-GROUNDING NEEDS, ON THE REAL OBJECT.** `wireCommitR8` is a CHAINED absorption:
the 4-limb head, the body's 3-limb `chunk31` chunks each re-absorbing the previous 8-felt digest,
the receipt root last.  `wireCommitComp` is that chain as an ORACLE PROGRAM — one `query` node per
absorption step, the previous ANSWER threaded into the next query point — and `wireCommitComp_eval`
proves its run at the deployed permutation IS `wireCommitR8`, step for step.  NOTHING in this
section is idealized: the oracle type is the deployed `List ℤ → List ℤ`, and the budget
(`wireCommitComp_queryBounded`: exactly `deployedBlockCount + 1` queries at the proved payload width) is a fact
of the deployed schedule. -/

/-! ## §S — the state-commit binding, RE-GROUNDED on the keyed sampled-oracle floor.

⚑⚑ **THE HEADLINE SUCCESSOR to the deleted `stateCommit_binds_from_polyTime`.**  §R's reduction
shape is kept — a state forgery becomes a collision — but the GAME moves to the model where a
collision floor is PROVABLE: the hash is a SAMPLED ORACLE the adversary can only QUERY
(`Dregg2.Crypto.RomChainedReduction`, resting on `KeyedRomFloor.keyedRom_hard` — the birthday
bound, a theorem).  The carrier below is §Q's DEPLOYED SCHEDULE: a 4-limb head, then `deployedBlockCount` three-limb
blocks (the body's `chunk31` chunks + the iroot block — `deployed_blockCount`, `chunk31_three_wide`), each
step re-absorbing the previous digest, tag-separated by the four-tag space `WideKeyed` samples.
The binding takes NO floor hypothesis — `stateCommitRom_binds`'s only inputs are a polynomial query
budget and the forger — and §P's `Classical.choice` collision-answerer is PROVABLY excluded at this
layer (`stateCommitRom_choiceForger_excluded`).

⚑ **THE MODELLING STEP, OUT LOUD (not smuggled).**  The floor demands a `λ`-GROWING digest space
(`hw : |R l| = 2^l`).  The deployed Poseidon2 squeeze is a FIXED vector of 31-bit BabyBear felts —
there is NO `l` at which its cardinality is `2^l`.  So this section idealizes the felt at width
`2^l` (digests `Fin (2^l)`, limbs `Fin (2^l)`), exactly the standard random-oracle idealization of
the deployed sponge at an asymptotic digest width, and exactly the deliberate labelled step
`Dregg2.lean` §DomainSeparatedCREffRegrounded demands.  What IS proved: the deployed CHAIN
SCHEDULE's binding, over a sampled oracle, against query-counted adversaries, with no false
hypothesis.  What is NOT claimed: that the fixed BabyBear Poseidon2 is a random oracle, or any
derivation from the deployed permutation's algebra.  The un-idealizable residual is priced by §P's
refutation: NO floor over the fixed public function survives, at any honest adversary class. -/

/-- **THE IDEALIZED STATE-COMMIT ORACLE FAMILY** — four domain-separation tags (the `WideKeyed`
shape), a domain of head blocks (4 idealized limbs) ⊕ step inputs (digest × 3-limb block), and a

/-- **⚑⚑ THE RE-GROUNDED STATE-COMMIT BINDING — NO floor hypothesis; the floor is a THEOREM.**
A query-bounded chained forger against the deployed state-commit schedule has NEGLIGIBLE advantage:
the eight-felt chained anchor binds the head and every block of its payload except with negligible
probability, over the sampled tag-separated oracle.  Budget accounting: the forger's `Q` plus the
extractor's re-walk of both chains (`deployedExtractorBudget = 2·deployedBlockCount + 2`).  This is what the deleted
`stateCommit_binds_from_polyTime` pretended to be — same reduction shape, but what sits under it is

(`Q = deployedExtractorBudget` — enough for a forger to compute both its chains honestly, §Q's
`deployedBlockCount + 1` queries each).  Four facts at once:

  1. the re-grounded binding FIRES: every such chained forger's advantage is negligible;
  2. the class is INHABITED (a fixed-answer 0-query member), and its advantage is negligible by 1 —
     the general defanging of the DISTINCT fixed-pair refuter shape (the one that wins with
     probability `1` against the fixed public function) is `fixedChainedForger_negl`: admitted by
     the class, collapsed by the sampling, not excluded by fiat;
  3. the game is WINNABLE (`l ≥ 1`: at a constant oracle any two distinct payloads equivocate), so
     the negligible advantage is earned against a live event;
  4. the UNRESTRICTED floor at the same game is FALSE — the query bound does the work.

The budget is not special: `stateCommitRom_binds` takes any polynomially bounded `Q`. -/
