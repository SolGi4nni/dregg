# `Metatheory.Open.BlindedSpanHiding` — the ZK-HIDING of the blinded span-commitment, moved from a
prover-side hand-wave to (a) an UNCONDITIONAL statistical theorem + (b) a CONDITIONAL reduction to a
NAMED Poseidon2 preimage floor against the REAL cost-model adversary, and (c) a precisely-named OPEN.

## The object

The wide blinded membership descriptor (`Dregg2.Circuit.Emit.BlindedMembershipWideEmit`, read-only)
publishes an 8-felt blinded leaf `wBLINDED = A9(cur8 ‖ blinding)` — the deployed shape the task writes
as `hole_commit = hash_4_to_1_wide([span_digest8, C_T, BLINDING, 0])`: the 8-felt span digest and a
FRESH HIDDEN blinding felt, absorbed by the deployed wide Poseidon2 (`Poseidon2Binding.babyBearD4W16`),
with the public commit-to-tree `C_T` in the preimage. `BLINDING` and `span_digest8` stay HIDDEN — that
hiddenness IS the unlinkability the anonymous-credential show relies on. The emit file states hiding as
English prose ("leaf + blinding stay HIDDEN"); there was NO theorem. This file supplies one.

We model the preimage assembly ABSTRACTLY (`assemble`) so the theorem is faithful to the deployed arity;
`BlindedSpanCommitment.wideHash` is the `Poseidon2Binding` `List ℤ → …` object and `tagCode` its
domain-separation prefix.

## HONEST CLASSIFICATION — this is the spine of the deliverable

  * **(a) UNCONDITIONAL — the statistical / perfect-blinding fragment (`§4`, `PerfectBlinding`).** Under
    the perfect-blinding idealization — a uniform `BLINDING` makes the commitment view a WITNESS-FREE
    simulation, `view ct span = sim ct` — the verifier's view carries LITERALLY ZERO information about
    which span was committed (`spanBlind_view_indep`), and two spans are unlinkable
    (`spanBlind_unlinkable`). This is a real `Metatheory.Open.PerfectZK` instance, proved with NO
    hypothesis, kernel-clean, WITH TEETH (an unblinded/leaky view fails it). ⚠ It is the INFORMATION-
    THEORETIC IDEAL: the deployed fixed sponge does NOT satisfy it (a fixed function into one bounded
    field is not perfectly hiding); its hiding is the COMPUTATIONAL (b) half. This mirrors exactly how
    `PerfectZK` scopes its own `otp`/`fieldZK` vs the computational residue.

  * **(b) CONDITIONAL on a NAMED Poseidon2 preimage floor, vs the REAL `PolyTime` adversary (`§2`,`§3`).**
    A span-recovery hiding break of the DEPLOYED blinded leaf REDUCES to inverting the domain-separated
    wide Poseidon2 on the published commitment: `span_recovery_hard_from_preimage_floor` — for EVERY
    adversary class `Eff`, if the extracted preimage-finder is in `Eff` and the wide hash is
    preimage-hard at `Eff` (`WidePreimageFloor`), a span-recoverer has NEGLIGIBLE advantage. The reduction
    is a real extractor (`recoverToPreimage`) + advantage inequality (`recover_adv_le`), NOT a `P → P`
    unfold: the floor game (wide-hash preimage) and the consumer game (deployed span recovery) are
    DIFFERENT games, connected only by the extractor (the CANARY `floor_at_other_finder_does_not_discharge`
    pins that). The `IsPolyTime` instantiation
    (`span_recovery_hard_from_polyTime`) is DELETED (07-24): its floor is REFUTED in this file
    (`widePreimageFloor_polyTime_false`), and its DISCHARGED successor is LANDED —
    `Metatheory.Open.BlindedSpanHidingKeyed.span_hiding_from_keyed_floor` / `spanRecoverGap_le`, the
    same consumer on the PROVED keyed query-counted hiding floor
    (`KeyedRomHidingFloor.keyedRomHiding_hard`), with the hardcoder ADMITTED and DEFANGED.

    ⚠ **THE HONEST PRICE, PROVED IN-FILE.** `WidePreimageFloor D (IsPolyTime …)` — the floor the
    `polyTime` instantiation rests on — is itself REFUTED at deployed parameters
    (`widePreimageFloor_polyTime_false`): `CostAdversary.idAdv` prices ANSWER SIZE, never search
    difficulty, so the constant finder that HARDCODES the (fixed, short) honest opening is `IsPolyTime`
    and wins with probability `1`. This is the `KeyedRomFloor.sysRoots_floor_polyTime_false_babyBear`
    disease. So the `IsPolyTime` form was VACUOUS at the deployed hash, exactly like
    the deleted `WideCommitBoundary.stateCommit_binds_from_polyTime`. The NON-VACUOUS floor is the KEYED,
    QUERY-COUNTED class (challenge sampled AFTER the adversary, so it cannot hardcode) — and its hiding
    instance now EXISTS (`Dregg2.Crypto.KeyedRomHidingFloor` + `BlindedSpanHidingKeyed`), which is why
    the `IsPolyTime` form is deleted rather than kept beside it.

  * **(c) OPEN — NOT in scope, NOT claimed.** Two things stay open, faithfully, as `EpistemicDial`/
    `PerfectZK` already hold them:
      1. the FULL two-world INDISTINGUISHABILITY (semantic hiding): the genuine hiding advantage is a
         DIFFERENCE of two probabilities `|Pr[A=1|commit span₀] − Pr[A=1|commit span₁]|`, which is
         `FloorGames.distAdv`-SHAPED (§7), NOT a `gameAdv`/`winProb`, and `CostAdversary.IsPolyTime` does
         not type over `Distinguisher`s. Preimage-recovery (this file's (b)) is a SUFFICIENT hiding break
         — recover the opening and you have the span — not the indistinguishability form.
      2. the STARK HVZK simulator (that the `HidingFriPcs` random-row blinding actually SIMULATES the
         proof transcript) — the computational-ZK residue `EpistemicDial`/`PerfectZK` name.

The win is exactly (a) proven + (b) conditional-on-a-named-floor-vs-a-real-`PolyTime`-adversary, with the
floor's vacuity at `IsPolyTime` proved and the query-counted successor named — the repo's methodology.

## Axiom hygiene

`#assert_axioms` on every load-bearing arm ⊆ {propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}; NO `sorry`, NO
fresh `axiom`, NO `native_decide`. The named floor `WidePreimageFloor` is a `def`/HYPOTHESIS reduced to,
never an `axiom`. NEW file; imports read-only.

  `Poseidon2KeyedBridge.DomainSeparatedSponge`.
* `CT` — the public commit-to-tree `C_T` (a public coordinate of the preimage; not hidden).
* `honestSpan` — the HIDDEN 8-felt span digest a real show commits (the witness); a field, exactly as
  `FloorGames.MLWEFamily.secret` is — the win relations reference it, and it is what the adversary must
  NOT learn.

/-- **THE SPAN-RECOVERY HIDING-BREAK GAME (the consumer).** The adversary is handed a sampled
domain-separation tag and WINS iff it outputs an OPENING `(span, blinding)` of the published blinded leaf
`hole_commit` at that tag — i.e. it RECOVERS the committed span. Recovering the opening is a hiding break
(you learn the span). The instance is the tag ALONE — the span/blinding are NOT in it; the adversary must
find them. -/

/-- **THE WIDE-POSEIDON2 PREIMAGE GAME (the floor).** The adversary is handed a sampled tag and WINS iff
it outputs a PREIMAGE of the published commitment under the domain-separated wide hash. This is
preimage-resistance / one-wayness of the deployed `wideHash` — the NAMED Poseidon2 floor the hiding break
reduces to. -/

/-- **THE NAMED FLOOR — preimage-hardness of the domain-separated wide Poseidon2.** `WidePreimageFloor D
Eff`: every `Eff`-adversary inverts the deployed wide hash on the published commitment only with
negligible probability. A HYPOTHESIS (never an `axiom`), the standard preimage-resistance assumption; the
`§3` reduction rests on it. At the query-counted class it is the honest successor of the refuted
`IsPolyTime` instance (see `widePreimageFloor_polyTime_false`). -/

/-! ## §2 — THE REDUCTION: a span-recoverer becomes a wide-hash preimage-finder. -/

/-- **THE EXTRACTOR, AS A MAP OF ADVERSARIES.** A span-recoverer becomes a wide-hash preimage-finder by
ASSEMBLING the recovered opening into the wide preimage `[span, C_T, blinding, 0]`. This is a pure output
reshaping with the tag passed through (an `Adversary.postMap` shape), so `§3` discharges its efficiency. -/

/-- **⚑ WIN-PRESERVATION — the reduction, at the game level.** Every tag the span-recoverer wins, the
extracted preimage-finder wins: an opening of the blinded leaf IS a preimage of the wide hash on the
published commitment. Definitional (`commitAt = wideHashAt ∘ assemble`). -/

preimage-finder's, at every parameter, over the SAME sampled tag space. -/

/-- **⚑ SPAN HIDING FROM THE PREIMAGE FLOOR — the general-`Eff` reduction (THE HEADLINE).** Under the
named preimage floor at a class `Eff`, a span-recoverer whose EXTRACTED preimage-finder is in `Eff` has
NEGLIGIBLE advantage: the deployed blinded leaf hides its span except with negligible probability. The
content is the reduction (`recover_adv_le`), NOT a `P → P` unfold — the floor game and the consumer game
are DIFFERENT (`floor_at_other_finder_does_not_discharge` is the canary). `hEff` is the standard "the
reduction is efficient" (`FloorGames` §8); the DISCHARGED instantiation is
`BlindedSpanHidingKeyed.span_hiding_from_keyed_floor` on the PROVED keyed hiding floor (the
`IsPolyTime` discharge that stood in §3 is DELETED — `widePreimageFloor_polyTime_false` refutes its
floor). -/

    (D.recover_adv_le A) (hFloor (D.recoverToPreimage A) hEff)

/-! ## §3 — ⚑ the `IsPolyTime` discharge is DELETED; the successor is LANDED.

`span_recovery_hard_from_polyTime` stood here: `Eff := IsPolyTime`, extractor efficiency discharged by
`poly_time`. Its floor `WidePreimageFloor (IsPolyTime …)` is REFUTED below
(`widePreimageFloor_polyTime_false` — the hardcoder of the FIXED published opening is `IsPolyTime` and
wins with probability `1`), so the theorem was VACUOUS at the deployed hash. It is DELETED, not kept
beside the repair; the DISCHARGED successor is `Metatheory.Open.BlindedSpanHidingKeyed`
(`span_hiding_from_keyed_floor`, `spanRecoverGap_le`, `blindedSpan_recovery_negl`): the same
span-recovery consumer on the PROVED keyed query-counted hiding floor
(`KeyedRomHidingFloor.keyedRomHiding_hard`, challenge and blinding sampled AFTER the adversary), with
the hardcoder ADMITTED at `Q = 0` and its recovery gap EXACTLY `0` — defanged, not excluded. The
refutation and the class-inhabitation teeth below are KEPT: they are the cure's record, not the
disease. -/

/-! ## §3b — NON-VACUITY: both games are winnable at ⊤; the floor's poles; the IsPolyTime price. -/

/-- **(⊤-POLE — the consumer game is NON-VACUOUS: brute force WINS it.)** The honest opening exists at
every tag, so the span-recovery game's solvable fraction is `1` and its unrestricted floor is FALSE — the
`bruteForce`/`choiceAdv` twin that recovers the span wins. This is the required "the ⊤-pole brute-force
adversary WINS the game". -/

/-- **THE POLY-TIME CLASS IS INHABITED AT THE FLOOR GAME** (so the floor is not the `⊥` class in
disguise): the constant finder that writes the honest preimage has bounded answer size, hence is
`IsPolyTime`. -/

/-- **⚑ THE PRICE, PROVED — `WidePreimageFloor D (IsPolyTime …)` IS FALSE.** The constant finder that
HARDCODES the honest preimage of the (fixed, published) commitment is `IsPolyTime` (answer size `11`) and
wins with probability `1`, so the preimage floor at the `IsPolyTime` class is refuted — exactly the
`KeyedRomFloor.sysRoots_floor_polyTime_false_babyBear` disease (`idAdv` prices answer SIZE, never search
difficulty). Hence `span_recovery_hard_from_polyTime` is VACUOUS at the deployed hash. The non-vacuous
floor samples the challenge AFTER the adversary (the KEYED / QUERY-COUNTED class), which this abstract
`IsPolyTime` model cannot express — the named residual. -/

⚠ This is the PERFECT/STATISTICAL ideal (the marginal of a uniform-blinded commitment is span-free); the
DEPLOYED fixed sponge does NOT satisfy it — its hiding is the computational `§2/§3` half. `simView` is a
