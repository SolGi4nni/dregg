# Metatheory.PolisGrade — graded severity: the quantale of violation-grades.

gem3.5flash's point (and gpt5.5's "quantale when budgets/cost demand it"): grade-laundering and
hole-rent are not Boolean — they ACCUMULATE and LAUNDER numeric coercion-capital across time and
branching, so the grade must be a **quantale**: an order `≤` (severity), a monoid `⊗` (sequential
accumulation, unit = "no violation"), a join `⊔` (worst-case over branches), with `⊗` MONOTONE and
DISTRIBUTING over `⊔` (so a linear action composed with a branch is the worst-case composition).
Boolean safety is the degenerate two-point instance.

We give the (binary) `GradeAlgebra` class, the **max-plus / tropical** model on `ℕ` (`⊔ = max`,
`⊗ = +` — accumulate worst-case cost; `+` distributes over `max`), graded bars with `or`-aggregation
and graded non-regression (`GradedNoWeaken`: severity only ever increases — "no legal rewrite closes
the door, even with numeric costs / finality tiers / time-locks"), and the graded amendment-stream
theorem. The deployed `Dregg2.Finality.Tier` is the intended *finality* grade instance (its rank is
the severity order); wiring that instance is the deployment step.

Pure Lean 4 core (imports only the import-free `Metatheory.Polis`; `ℕ` + `omega`); no `sorry`.

/-- HOLE-RENT: severity ACCUMULATES over epochs (`⊗ = +`) — a hole open 3 epochs grades `3`. -/

/-- GRADE-LAUNDERING: severity is the WORST tier reached (`⊔ = max`) — `max 2 4 = 4`. -/
example : GradeAlgebra.join (2 : Nat) 4 = 4 := by decide
/-- `or` aggregates worst-case: the union of grade-2 and grade-4 bars grades `4`. -/
example : ((⟨fun _ => 2⟩ : GradedBar Nat Unit).or ⟨fun _ => 4⟩).severity () = 4 := by decide
/-- GRADED NON-REGRESSION: a grade-3 floor dominates a grade-1 floor pointwise. -/
example : GradedNoWeaken (⟨fun _ => 1⟩ : GradedBar Nat Unit) ⟨fun _ => 3⟩ :=
  fun _ => by show (1 : Nat) ≤ 3; omega
/-- … and `+`-distributes over `max` (the quantale law): `a ⊗ (b ⊔ c) = (a⊗b) ⊔ (a⊗c)`. -/

        = GradeAlgebra.join (GradeAlgebra.comp 3 2) (GradeAlgebra.comp 3 5) := by decide
