# Metatheory.ResharingChain — forward-secure COMMITTEE SECRETS: the D-side dual of KERI.

A **resharing chain** is a sequence of common secrets `S₀ → S₁ → … → Sₙ` in which each `Sₙ₊₁`
is a fresh re-sharing of the SAME underlying secret value to a (possibly new) committee, causally
linked to `Sₙ` (proactive secret sharing, iterated — Herzberg-Jarecki-Krawczyk-Yung 1995). This
module formalizes the object as the **D-side dual of KERI pre-rotation** (`Dregg2.Apps.PreRotation`):

  > KERI's pre-rotation gives a forward-secure IDENTITY chain — the `∀`/`Knows` side: compromise of
  > the CURRENT signing key cannot rewrite the past (`rotChain_pinned_by_commitments`, a public
  > COMMITMENT chain pins the key history). A resharing chain gives forward-secure COMMITTEE SECRETS
  > — the `D`/`DistKnows^{≥K}` side: compromise of the CURRENT shares cannot reveal the past, because
  > each reshare RE-RANDOMIZES the shares (same `f(0)`, fresh higher coefficients) and the old shares
  > are erased. The SAME forward-security shape applied to the two epistemic polarities dregg already
  > pairs — single-agent signing (`Knows`/`EpistemicConsensus`) vs group-pooled common-secret
  > (`DistKnows^{≥K}`/`CommonSecret`).

It EXTENDS `Metatheory.CommonSecret` (`ThresholdFrame`, `KnowsSecret`, `subThreshold_secret_blind`):
the per-epoch node `Sₙ` is a `ThresholdFrame`; the chain LINK adds the fresh-randomness floor.

DISCIPLINE (the `CommonSecret`/`PreRotation` bar, verbatim): faithful Props; the SINGLE
cryptographic obligation — that a sub-threshold POST-reshare coalition's pooled view is
information-theoretically consistent with EVERY value of the PRE-reshare secret (HJKY renewal-secrecy
/ the mobile-adversary floor) — enters ONLY as the `ReshareLink.forward_blind` STRUCTURAL FIELD, the
exact analogue of `subThreshold_blind` (and of `KeySetCR` on the ∀-side), NEVER an `axiom`/`sorry`.
Every keystone is pinned `#assert_axioms` (kernel-clean: only `propext`/`Classical.choice`/
`Quot.sound`), so a `sorryAx` fails the build. A discriminating concrete model (§5) — a real reshare
of a 2-of-2 XOR secret to two FRESH shares of the SAME secret — certifies the keystones non-vacuous.

The four angles (`docs/deos/RESHARING-CHAINS.md`):
  * §A — the forward-secure common-secret chain + `reshareChain_forward_secret` (the cliff across a link);
  * §B — the chain as a PRIME EVENT STRUCTURE (causal links = a partial order, fork = re-randomize);
  * §C — the KERI-DUAL SYMMETRY (the `∀`-side and `D`-side as instances of one "forward-secure chain");
  * §5 — the non-vacuity certificate.

/-! # §A. The reshare LINK and forward-secure common secrets — the D-side dual of KERI.

A reshare link `Sₙ → Sₙ₊₁` carries two `ThresholdFrame`s over the SAME secret space `S`, the
guarantee that the recoverable secret VALUE is identical pre/post (`f(0)` preserved — the HJKY
renewal pins the constant term), and the one crypto floor: a sub-threshold POST coalition, EVEN
holding whatever (un-erased) PRE shares it corrupted, is information-theoretically blind on the PRE
secret. That floor is `subThreshold_blind` relocated across the link — carried as a structural field
exactly as `CommonSecret` carries the within-epoch floor, NEVER an axiom. -/

/-- **A reshare LINK** `Sₙ → Sₙ₊₁`: two threshold frames over the SAME secret space, with `f(0)`
preserved and the cross-epoch fresh-randomness floor.

The `Indist` of `post.base` is the POST coalition's pooled view; `forward_blind` says that view,
when restricted to a sub-threshold POST coalition, is consistent with EVERY value of the PRE secret
read through `pre.secret` along the SHARED world space `Ω`. We share the world space `Ω` between the
two frames: a world `w : Ω` carries both the pre share-assignment (read by `pre`) and the post
share-assignment (read by `post`); the reshare re-randomizes the post-readout while pinning
`pre.secret`/`post.secret` to agree on the actual world (`secret_preserved`). -/
structure ReshareLink (Ω : Type u) (ι : Type v) (S : Type u) where
  /-- The PRE-reshare epoch's threshold frame (the secret as held by committee `Gₙ`). -/
  pre  : ThresholdFrame Ω ι S
  /-- The POST-reshare epoch's threshold frame (the SAME secret as held by `Gₙ₊₁`). -/
  post : ThresholdFrame Ω ι S
  /-- Both frames are anchored at the SAME actual world — the reshare is an event ON the live state,
  not a fresh sample (the constant term `f(0)` is pinned by the HJKY anchor commitments). -/
  same_actual : post.base.actual = pre.base.actual
  /-- **`f(0)` PRESERVED** — the recoverable secret VALUE is identical pre/post (the homomorphic
  reshare keeps `Σ λⱼ sⱼ = f(0)`; the group public key, and any already-issued beacon, survive). -/
  secret_preserved : post.secret post.base.actual = pre.secret pre.base.actual
  /-- **FORWARD BLINDNESS — the cross-epoch crypto floor (THE hypothesis, never an axiom).** A
  POST-epoch coalition `B` that does NOT reach the POST threshold cannot, even pooling its POST view,
  distinguish the actual world from one with a DIFFERENT PRE secret value: for every alternative `s`,
  there is a world `w'` that `B` jointly confuses with the actual world (via the POST indist.) and
  whose PRE secret is `s`. This is `subThreshold_blind` ADVANCED ONE EPOCH — the renewal-secrecy /
  mobile-adversary floor of HJKY (re-randomized shares ⇒ the post view masks the pre share vector),
  carried STRUCTURALLY exactly as `CommonSecret.subThreshold_blind` is. -/

/-- **`PostKnowsPreSecret B`** — a POST-epoch coalition `B` knows the PRE-reshare secret: its POST
pooled view rules out every world with a different PRE secret value. Forward security DENIES this for
sub-threshold `B`. (This is `KnowsSecret` of the PRE secret-proposition, evaluated through the POST
indistinguishability — the coalition's epoch-`n+1` view tested against the epoch-`n` secret.) -/

  ∀ w', (∀ i, B i → L.post.base.Indist i w' L.post.base.actual) →

/-- **`reshareChain_forward_secret` — FORWARD SECRECY, the cliff RELOCATED ACROSS A LINK, PROVED,
kernel-clean.** After the reshare `Sₙ → Sₙ₊₁`, a sub-threshold POST coalition does NOT know the PRE
secret: if `B ⊆ post.committee` and `¬ post.ReachesThreshold B`, then `¬ PostKnowsPreSecret B`.

The proof is BYTE-FOR-BYTE `CommonSecret.subThreshold_secret_blind` with `forward_blind` substituted
for `subThreshold_blind` — *that is the whole point of the dual*: forward security is not a new
theorem, it is the common-secret cliff with the coalition's view advanced one epoch. `forward_blind`
hands us, for the alternative PRE-secret value `s₀ ≠ pre.secret actual`, a world `w'` that `B`
confuses with the actual world (POST view) whose PRE secret is `s₀` — so `B`'s post-pooled view
cannot pin the pre secret. This is the D-side `rotate_current_keys_irrelevant`+`compromise_resistant`:
holding the CURRENT (post) shares contributes NOTHING toward the PAST (pre) secret. -/

/-- **`secret_value_survives` — the PRE secret VALUE is unchanged at the actual world.** The reshare
moves the SHARES, not the secret: `post.secret actual = pre.secret actual`. The dual of KERI's
"the committed key history is pinned" — here the recoverable VALUE is pinned while the carrier
(shares) refreshes. The conjunction of this with `reshareChain_forward_secret` is the D-side jump:
the value is RECOVERABLE-AT-THRESHOLD post-reshare yet INVISIBLE to a sub-threshold post coalition's
view of the pre secret. -/
theorem secret_value_survives :
    L.post.secret L.post.base.actual = L.pre.secret L.pre.base.actual :=

/-- **`reshare_forward_jump` — the forward-security JUMP stated as one proposition, PROVED.** Across
the link, the PRE secret is BOTH invisible to a sub-threshold POST coalition AND still the value the
POST committee recovers (it equals the post secret). One coalition-size step (`B` below threshold)
flips knowledge-of-the-PAST-secret from `⊥` to the recoverable present value — the non-amplification
tooth carried ACROSS an epoch boundary. The D-side analogue of `PreRotation`'s
`preimage_blocks_cooled_rotation` triangle: the present cannot reach back. -/

A resharing chain is a list of reshare links that compose: each link's `post` is the next link's
`pre` (the constant-term anchor `Cⱼ,₀ = pkⱼ_old` of `ReshareDealing` makes `rₙ₊₁` depend on `rₙ`).
We carry the chain as a list whose adjacency is the composition coherence, and lift forward security
to "every PRE secret along the chain is invisible to any sub-threshold coalition of the CURRENT
(final) epoch" — the full mobile-adversary statement: a present compromise reveals NO past epoch. -/

/-- **A resharing CHAIN** over a shared world/agent/secret space: a nonempty sequence of frames
`frames` (the epochs `S₀, S₁, …`) with, for each adjacent pair, a `ReshareLink` whose `pre`/`post`

because the floor is per-link and structural, the chain inherits forward security with NO new

dregg's distributed-time-travel frame (`DISTRIBUTED-TIMETRAVEL-SEMANTICS.md §2.1`, Winskel) is a
prime event structure `(E, ≤, #)`: events, a causal partial order `≤`, and a symmetric irreflexive
conflict `#` INHERITED along `≤` (`# ∧ ≤ ⟹ #`). A **configuration** is a downward-closed,
conflict-free set. The blocklace IS such a structure (`Dregg2/Distributed/BlocklaceFinality.lean`,
`Coord/CausalOrder.lean::happenedBefore` is the strict partial order). We give the abstract object
here (self-contained in `Metatheory/`) and embed a resharing chain into it: reshare events as a
`≤`-line, committee-equivocation as conflict, a fork = re-randomize at a configuration. -/

A linear (non-forking) resharing chain is a TOTAL order of reshare events: `r₀ ≤ r₁ ≤ … ≤ rₙ`. We

conflict on the line — a fork ADDS conflicting events off the line) and the trivial configuration =
a downward-closed prefix. This certifies the embedding is real: the chain IS a `≤`-line in a prime
event structure, so branch-and-stitch operates on it unchanged. -/

/-! # §C. The KERI-DUAL SYMMETRY — the `∀`-side and the `D`-side as ONE forward-secure chain.

The ember insight, stated as a STRUCTURE (not a forced analogy): a **forward-secure chain** is an
abstract object — a sequence of states with a per-link guarantee that a present compromise cannot
recover a past secret — and BOTH KERI pre-rotation and the resharing chain are instances, differing
only in WHICH epistemic quantity is forward-secured and WHICH carrier discharges the floor:

  * the `∀`/`Knows` side (KERI): the carrier is COMMITMENT-BINDING (`KeySetCR`), the protected
    quantity is the SIGNING-key history (`rotChain_pinned_by_commitments`);
  * the `D`/`DistKnows^{≥K}` side (resharing): the carrier is the INFO-THEORETIC CLIFF
    (`forward_blind`), the protected quantity is the COMMITTEE-secret history
    (`reshareChain_forward_secret`).

We capture "forward-secure across a link" as a single predicate over an abstract link, and prove the
resharing link satisfies it. The KERI side's discharge lives in `Dregg2.Apps.PreRotation`
(`rotate_current_keys_irrelevant`: the current keys contribute nothing to a rotation) — the same
"the present cannot reach the past" content. Stating the schema makes the duality PRECISE: both are
"nothing of the past below the present's gate." -/

/-- **`ForwardSecureLink`** — the abstract forward-security schema across one chain link. An observer
type `Obs`, a `belowGate` predicate (the observer is below its production gate — sub-threshold on the
D-side / not-the-committed-key on the ∀-side), a `reachesPast` predicate (the observer's present view
PINS the past secret/key), and the single guarantee `cannot_reach_past`: a below-gate observer canNOT
reach the past. This is the polarity-NEUTRAL "nothing of the past below the present's gate" shape;
§A's `ReshareLink` is the D-side instance, KERI's `rotateStep` (`rotate_current_keys_irrelevant`) the
∀-side. The faithfulness is that `reachesPast` is the OBJECT's real pin predicate, not a tautology. -/

observer is a sub-threshold committee coalition CARRIED WITH its sub-threshold proof and an actual
alternative pre-secret value (the SSS non-degeneracy); `belowGate` always holds (the carried proof IS
below threshold); `reachesPast B` is `PostKnowsPreSecret B` (its POST view pins the PRE secret);
`cannot_reach_past` is exactly `reshareChain_forward_secret`. This is the formal sense in which the
resharing chain is the D-side dual of KERI's ∀-side `rotChain_pinned_by_commitments`: both inhabit
`ForwardSecureLink`, and the D-side's `cannot_reach_past` IS the relocated common-secret cliff. -/

`cannot_reach_past`. The ∀-side membership is the content of `Dregg2.Apps.PreRotation`

irrelevant to a rotation), CITED here, not re-proved (it lives in the `Dregg2` root over the live

/-! # §5. A DISCRIMINATING model — non-vacuity (a real reshare of a 2-of-2 XOR secret).

We reuse `CommonSecret.TwoOfTwo`'s 2-of-2 XOR scheme as the PRE epoch and exhibit a POST epoch that
re-randomizes the shares to the SAME secret. Concretely: the secret is a bit `s`; the PRE shares are
`(a, b)` with `a ⊕ b = s` (actual `(true, false)`, secret `true`); the POST shares re-randomize via a
mask `m` to `(a ⊕ m, b ⊕ m)` — same XOR (`(a⊕m) ⊕ (b⊕m) = a ⊕ b = s`), fresh carrier. A world here is
`(a, b, m)` ∈ `Bool³`: PRE reads `a ⊕ b`, POST reads `(a⊕m) ⊕ (b⊕m)`, the post agents see the post
shares. A sub-threshold POST coalition (a single agent) is blind to the PRE secret because the unseen
post share — together with the fresh mask — is consistent with either pre value. This certifies
`forward_blind` is realizable and `reshareChain_forward_secret` is non-vacuous. -/

A **resharing chain** is the D-side dual of KERI pre-rotation. The forward-secure common-secret
CHAIN object is `ResharingChain` (epochs as `ThresholdFrame`s, boundaries as `ReshareLink`s); the
FORWARD-SECURITY law is `ReshareLink.reshareChain_forward_secret` — the common-secret cliff
(`CommonSecret.subThreshold_secret_blind`) RELOCATED across a link, proved by the same shape with the
cross-epoch `forward_blind` floor substituted for `subThreshold_blind` (carried STRUCTURALLY, never
an axiom — the HJKY renewal-secrecy / mobile-adversary discharge). The CHAIN-AS-EVENT-STRUCTURE
embedding is `PrimeEventStructure` (causal `≤` partial order + conflict-heredity, the blocklace
shape): the chain is a `≤`-line (`lineES`/`linePrefix_isConfig`), a FORK is a concurrent conflicting
pair that no configuration holds (`fork_not_in_one_config`) — branch-and-stitch on randomness. The
KERI-DUAL SYMMETRY is `ForwardSecureLink` with `ReshareLink.toForwardSecure`: the ∀-side (KERI,
commitment-binding carrier, `rotChain_pinned_by_commitments`) and the D-side (resharing,
info-theoretic-cliff carrier, `reshareChain_forward_secret`) are two instances of one "nothing of the
past below the present's gate" schema — the non-amplification tooth in both epistemic polarities. A
real reshare of a 2-of-2 XOR secret to fresh masked shares (§5) and a real un-mergeable fork (§5b)
certify every keystone non-vacuous. The single cryptographic obligation lives, faithfully, as the
`forward_blind` structural field — the exact analogue of `subThreshold_blind` and of `KeySetCR`. -/
