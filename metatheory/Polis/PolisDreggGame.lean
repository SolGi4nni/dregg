# Metatheory.PolisDreggGame — the SafetyGame instantiated on the REAL deployed dregg kernel.

`SafetyGame.lean` builds the canonical object — the viability kernel `K = νX. floor ∧ CPre X`
and the maximally-permissive `kernelShield` over it — for an *arbitrary* `Game`. The sandbox
files instantiate it on toy worlds (counters, scripted optimizers). This file instantiates it
on the **actual executable dregg2 kernel** (`Dregg2.Exec.Kernel`): the same `KernelState`,
`Turn`, and fail-closed `exec` that `exec_conserves` / `exec_authorized` are proved about, the
same machine the Rust boundary refines. So `ViabilityKernel dreggGame` is the *real* dregg
viability kernel and `kernelShield dreggGame` governs *real* dregg turns — the dregg side of the
membrane: governance over the deployed executor, not a model of it.

The `Game` fields, bound to dregg:
  * `World := KernelState`        — the live accounts/balances/caps.
  * `Move  := Turn`               — `{actor, src, dst, amt}`, one resource move under authority.
  * `Resp  := Unit`               — dregg's `exec` is deterministic (no adversary branching at
                                     the executor; the adversary is the *controller's choice of
                                     Turn*, universally quantified).
  * `step k t _ := (exec k t).getD k` — commit if `exec` succeeds, else stay (fail-closed shows
                                     up as a self-loop, exactly dregg's "refused turn = no-op").
  * `legal k t _ := (exec k t).isSome` — a move is legal iff `exec` admits it.
  * `floor`        — a REAL dregg floor: solvency (`∀ c ∈ accounts, 0 ≤ bal c`) ⋀ conservation
                     against a fixed reference total (`total k = total k0`). Both decidable.

What is proved, concretely (the membrane biting on the real machine):
  * `dreggGame_step_eq` / `dreggGame_legal_iff` — the game's `step`/`legal` ARE `exec`.
  * `floor_decidable` — the dregg floor is decidable (the governor is runnable).
  * `not_in_kernel_of_floor_violation` — a state breaking the floor is NOT in the kernel
    (kernel ⊆ floor), so the kernelShield REFUSES any move reaching it.
  * `shield_refuses_solvency_violation` / `shield_refuses_overdraft` — a turn whose committed
    successor is insolvent (or that exec itself refuses) is shielded: the world stays put.
  * `shield_admits_honest_when_kernel` — a turn whose committed successor is still in the kernel
    is admitted unchanged.
  * A concrete `#eval`/`#guard` model: an honest in-floor transfer; an overdraft refused; the
    floor-level governor (`genGovStep` over the dregg floor) admitting the honest one and
    shielding the harmful one — non-vacuous, both polarities, on REAL `exec`.

Honest scope below in the closing note: the kernel-level refusal theorems are the clean,
gfp-respecting facts (kernel ⊆ floor ⟹ refuse floor-breakers); membership of a concrete state
IN the kernel is not computed here (it is a greatest fixpoint over an infinite state space). The
floor-level `genGovStep` governor IS fully runnable and exercised on `exec` with `#guard`.

/-! ## §4. The CPre of the kernel is the real "there is a safe dregg turn".

Specializing `SafetyGame.CPre` and `kernel_invariant` to `dreggGame` reads: from any kernel
state there is a `Turn` whose every (here: the unique) `exec` outcome stays in the kernel. This
is dregg's "the system can always make a conserving, solvent, authorized move and remain so". -/

/-- From a kernel state there exists a real dregg `Turn` keeping the kernel against the
deterministic executor response. (`kernel_invariant` at `dreggGame`, unfolded to `exec`.) -/

    ∃ t : Turn, ∀ _u : Unit,

/-! ## §4b. The viability kernel is EXACTLY the dregg floor — discharging the antecedent.

The kernel-level theorems above (`dregg_kernel_has_safe_turn`, `shield_admits_when_kernel`) are
CONDITIONED on `ViabilityKernel (dreggGame k0) ·`, and the original honest-scope note flagged that
membership of a concrete state in the kernel was "not computed here" — leaving those two theorems
vacuously conditional: true implications whose antecedent nothing ever discharged (they never FIRE).

It IS computable, and cleanly. For the DETERMINISTIC dregg game the controllable predecessor
`CPre` is UNCONDITIONALLY inhabited: the always-refused self-transfer `⟨0,0,0,0⟩` has `src = dst`,
which `exec` rejects (`Kernel.exec`'s `turn.src ≠ turn.dst` guard), so it is never `legal` and the
"every legal response keeps `X`" obligation holds VACUOUSLY — for EVERY predicate `X` and state.
Hence `Φ X = floor` (constant in `X`), and its greatest fixpoint is the floor itself:

    ViabilityKernel (dreggGame k0) k  ↔  dreggFloor k0 k     (DECIDABLE).

The refusal self-loop is exactly "staying put is always an available safe move", so the maximally-
permissive governor collapses to the decidable floor governor of §5. This discharges the antecedent
(a concrete state is in the kernel iff in the decidable floor), makes the kernel `Decidable`, and
turns the two conditional theorems into ones that FIRE on real `g0` data (`g0_has_safe_turn`,
`shield_admits_honest_g0`). -/

/-- The controllable predecessor of the dregg game is UNCONDITIONALLY inhabited: the always-refused
self-transfer `⟨0,0,0,0⟩` (`src = dst`, which `exec` never commits) is legal-free, so the "keep `X`"
obligation is vacuous for EVERY `X` and state. This is what collapses the deterministic viability
kernel onto the floor. -/

/-- **`viabilityKernel_eq_dreggFloor`** — the viability kernel of the deterministic dregg game is
EXACTLY the decidable dregg floor. `⊆` is `kernel_subset_floor`; `⊇` is `kernel_maximal` applied to
`dreggFloor` as a controlled invariant, whose `CPre` obligation is `dreggGame_cpre_unconditional`.
This is the load-bearing bridge that discharges the kernel-membership antecedent. -/

The dregg side of the membrane, in one breath:

  * `dreggGame` instantiates the SafetyGame on the DEPLOYED `Dregg2.Exec` kernel — the same
    `exec` that `exec_conserves`/`exec_authorized` are proved about. Its `step`/`legal` ARE
    `exec` (`dreggGame_step_eq`, `dreggGame_legal_iff`).
  * `ViabilityKernel dreggGame` is the real dregg viability kernel; `kernelShield dreggGame`
    governs real dregg turns. Because the kernel is floor-contained, a turn reaching a
    floor-breaking state (insolvent or non-conserving) is REFUSED (`shield_refuses_*`), and a
    turn keeping the kernel is admitted (`shield_admits_when_kernel`).
  * §4b COMPUTES the kernel: for the deterministic dregg game `ViabilityKernel (dreggGame k0) =
    dreggFloor k0` (`viabilityKernel_eq_dreggFloor`), because the refusal self-loop makes `CPre`
    unconditionally inhabited (`dreggGame_cpre_unconditional`). So the kernel is `Decidable`, and
    the two previously-conditional kernel theorems FIRE on real `g0` data (`g0_in_kernel`,
    `g0_has_safe_turn`, `shield_admits_honest_g0`) — the antecedent is discharged, not assumed.
  * The runnable `genGovStep` over the decidable dregg floor is exercised on `exec` with
    `#guard`: it ADMITS an honest conserving transfer and SHIELDS an overdraft / unauthorized
    turn — non-vacuous, both polarities (`dregg_governor_both_polarity`), and the admitted turn
    is an authorized, supply-preserving dregg transition (`dregg_honest_admitted_is_lawful`).

Scope, now CLOSED: §4b computes gfp membership for concrete states — the kernel of the
deterministic dregg game is exactly the decidable floor (staying put is always a safe move, so
the maximally-permissive governor collapses onto the floor governor). The kernel-level admission
theorems are therefore exercised on real `g0` data, not left as vacuously-conditional shells.
Every `#guard`/`decide` asserts a TRUE proposition.
