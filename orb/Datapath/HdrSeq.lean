# Datapath.HdrSeq — the HEADER-GRAIN sibling of `Datapath.ByteSeq`

`Datapath.ByteSeq` is a typeclass of the byte-sequence ops a body/serialize stage
needs, with each op's denotation law proven ONCE per instance, so a stage written
once over `[ByteSeq T]` instantiates at `List UInt8` (the spec) and `ByteArray`
(the fast, genuinely-flat path) and its whole refinement FOLLOWS from the op laws.
The serve, though, crosses TWO grains: the response *body* (a byte sequence, done
by `ByteSeq`) and the response *header block*
(`Reactor.Response.headers : List (Proto.Bytes × Proto.Bytes)` — a header-PAIR
sequence). This module is the header-pair-grain instance of the SAME idea.

`HdrSeq H` carries the header-list ops a real header-transform stage uses —
`empty`, `push` (append one `(name, value)` pair), `append`, `filter` (keep the
pairs a predicate admits — the strip/remove primitive) — plus the denotation
`toHdrs : H → List (Bytes × Bytes)` (the abstraction relation to the deployed
`List`-typed header block) and the LAWS relating each op to its `List` meaning.
The laws are the op-level refinements (`empty_denote`, `push_denote`,
`append_denote`, `filter_denote`); proven once per instance, a header stage's
whole refinement is discharged from them.

Two instances:

* `instHdrSeqList : HdrSeq (List (Bytes × Bytes))` — the **spec**: `toHdrs := id`,
  every op the `List` op, every law `rfl`. A stage here *is* the deployed
  `List`-typed stage.
* `instHdrSeqBlock : HdrSeq HdrBlock` — the **fast, genuinely flat** path, reusing
  `Datapath.FlatHeaders.HdrBlock` (the header spine in a contiguous
  `Array (Bytes × Bytes)`): `push := Array.push` (amortized `O(1)`, no per-stage
  spine copy), `append := Array.append`, `filter := Array.filter` (a packed copy,
  NO cons-spine), `toHdrs := Array.toList` (the denotation, never run on the
  datapath). Each law is proven once from the core `Array` lemmas.

The single generic recursion lemma `foldPush_denote` (the header-grain sibling of
`ByteSeq.foldCat_denote`) pays the one induction a fixed-header-set fold needs, for
EVERY instance at once; every fixed-set header stage reuses it with no further
induction.

/-! ## The ONE generic recursion lemma — reused by every fixed-header-set stage

A header stage that stamps a fixed header set (`securityheaders`, the cors
allow branch, …) folds `push` over that `List (Bytes × Bytes)` set. `foldPush` is
that combinator, and `foldPush_denote` proves its denotation ONCE, by induction,
over an ABSTRACT `[HdrSeq H]` — using only `push_denote`. Every fixed-set header
stage reuses it with NO further induction: this is the single place induction is
paid for the whole family (the header-grain sibling of `ByteSeq.foldCat_denote`). -/

/-- Fold `push` over a fixed header set into an accumulator — polymorphic over the
header representation. -/
def foldPush {H : Type} [HdrSeq H] (xs : List (Bytes × Bytes)) (h : H) : H :=
  xs.foldl HdrSeq.push h

/-- **THE generic recursion lemma.** Folding a fixed header set `xs` onto any
`[HdrSeq H]` accumulator denotes to the `List` append `toHdrs h ++ xs`. Proven
ONCE, generic in `H`, from `push_denote` alone. Every fixed-set header stage's
refinement reuses this; no stage re-does the induction. -/

/-- At the spec instance `toHdrs = id`, so `foldPush` on a `List` header set is
exactly `h ++ xs` — the spec-side normal form the grounding lemmas use. -/
