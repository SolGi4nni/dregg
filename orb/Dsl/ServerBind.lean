  Dsl/ServerBind.lean — CLOSING THE LITERAL-BINDING GAP.

  `Dsl.Server` reflects a `server … where` block into a `ServerSpec` value AND
  emits an engine — but that engine dispatched through the FIXED demo route table
  (`Reactor.App.demoApp`), so a declared `route` was inert data: it never drove
  the deployed response. This file closes that gap.

    * `specToAppConfig : ServerSpec → Reactor.App.AppConfig` maps each DECLARED
      `Route1` to a real `Route.Match.Route App.Handler` — the route table is
      built from the declared routes, not `demoApp`;
    * `serveSpec spec` / `serveAuthSpec spec` run the deployed pipeline (the same
      Policy/Safety — and, for `serveAuthSpec`, JWT — gates the guarded serve
      runs) but dispatch through `App.handle (specToAppConfig spec)`, so the
      DECLARED routes decide the response;
    * `serveSpec_routes_declared` / `serveAuthSpec_routes_declared` — THE PAYOFF:
      on a dispatch that clears the gates, the engine serves
      `responseOfHandler` of the route the REAL `Route.Match.bestMatch` selected
      over `specToAppConfig spec`'s table — i.e. the response of the DECLARED
      handler. A different declaration yields a different response, so the binding
      is real, not fixed.

  The macro in `Dsl.Server` repoints `Name_engine := serveSpec Name` (or
  `serveAuthSpec` when `jwt` is declared) and emits `Name_routes_declared` as the
  instantiation of the payoff theorem at the declared spec.

  HONEST SCOPE. The ROUTES are re-driven from the declared block. The deployed
  listener/codec configuration (`deployConfig`: TLS/WS/SOCKS lanes) and the
  reactor front end (`deploySubs`) are still the fixed real `deployConfig` — the
  `listen`/`tls` clauses are reflected in `ServerSpec` but do not yet re-drive
  those codec fields. That listener/tls literal-binding is the named follow-on;
  the routes — the highest-value literal, the one that makes a declared feature
  drive the engine — are bound here.

/-! ## (1) The declared spec → a real application route table -/

/-- Split a character list on `/`, dropping empty segments. Structurally recursive
(so it reduces in the kernel — unlike `String.splitOn`, which is well-founded and
opaque to `decide`/`rfl`); `acc` accumulates the current segment in reverse. -/

  | [],        acc => if acc.isEmpty then [] else [String.ofList acc.reverse]
  | '/' :: cs, acc => if acc.isEmpty then splitSegsAux cs [] else String.ofList acc.reverse :: splitSegsAux cs []
  | c :: cs,   acc => splitSegsAux cs (c :: acc)

/-- A declared path string → normalized route segments: split on `/`, drop empty
segments, then run the same `Route.Path.normalize` boundary
`Reactor.App.targetSegments` applies to a request target — so a declared pattern
and the request it should match are normalized the same way. Uses the structural
`splitSegsAux` (not `String.splitOn`) so a concrete declared table reduces in the
kernel. -/
def pathSegs (p : String) : List String :=
  Route.Path.normalize (splitSegsAux p.data [])

/-- A declared `Match1` discipline + path → a real `Route.Match.Pat`. `exact` and
`prefix` map onto the library's own precedence classes. `glob` and `host` have no
distinct class in the core `Route.Match` algebra yet, so they are conservatively
bound to `prefix` (the widest safe class); a first-class glob/host matcher is a
named follow-on. -/

  | .prefix, p => .prefix (pathSegs p)
  | .glob,   p => .prefix (pathSegs p)
  | .host,   p => .prefix (pathSegs p)

/-- A declared `Handler1` → the real per-route `Reactor.App.Handler`:
  * `respond code body` → the static status/body handler carrying the DECLARED
    code and body (so `responseOfHandler` serves exactly them);
  * `static dir`        → a `200` static handler over the declared directory;
  * `proxyPool _`       → the reverse-proxy handler over the real health-filtered
    `Reactor.Proxy.demoPool` load-balancer;
  * `redirect code tgt` → a static handler carrying the DECLARED redirect code and
    target (the `Location` header binding is a follow-on; the status is bound). -/

selected over `specToAppConfig spec`'s table — i.e. the response of the DECLARED
