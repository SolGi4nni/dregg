# Proto.NotFoundProven — the DEPLOYED default-route `404 Not Found`

PROVE-WHAT-RUNS for the routing **fall-through 404** the running dataplane returns for any
well-formed target that matches no author route. The deployed default serve routes every
request through `Reactor.App.handle Reactor.App.demoApp`: the author routes
(`/health`, `/static`, `/cgi-bin`) are tried by the real `Route.Match.bestMatch`, and an
unmatched-but-safe path falls to the host/glob default handler (`.hostGlob demoVhBlocks`),
whose `anyHost` block ends in a catch-all route `VHandler.respond 404 "not found"`. So a
`GET /nope` under a non-vhost authority is answered by that catch-all — a genuine
router decision, not a hardcoded status.

Curl-confirmed against the deployed `dataplane` binary (io_uring):

    $ printf 'GET / HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: x\r\n\r\n' | nc 127.0.0.1 8080 | head
    HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found          ← proven here (status line + reason)
    Connection: keep-alive
    Date: Mon, 01 Jan 2024 00:00:00 GMT
    …
    $ curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8080/nope        # body
    not found                       ← proven here (9 bytes → Content-Length: 9)

This maps ledger row **rt.1** (route table default `404` fall-through): the deployed status
line, reason phrase, and body of the default 404 were DEPLOYED-UNPROVEN — no theorem pinned
the router's own miss response to the wire bytes. This file pins them.

Theorems (pure-kernel; `#print axioms` ⊆ {propext, Quot.sound} — no `native_decide`,
no `Lean.ofReduceBool`):

  * `deployed_default_404` — the whole deployed routing decision: for ANY request whose
    target normalizes to a single unmatched segment `["nope"]` under an authority that is
    neither exact vhost (any method / headers / query), `App.handle demoApp` returns the
    404 response `{status := 404, reason := reasonFor 404, headers := [], body := "not found"}`.
    Non-vacuous: it drives `bestMatch` → the host/glob default → `RouteAdvanced.dispatch`
    (`selectBlock` picks `anyHost`, then first-match routing falls past the glob and `/bulk`
    routes to the catch-all).
  * `nope_dispatches` — a concrete `GET /nope` routed request whose REAL `dispatch` reaches
    the catch-all 404 route, so the 404 branch is genuinely reachable (non-vacuity).
  * `reasonFor_404_wire_bytes` — the deployed reason phrase is exactly the 9 bytes of
    `"Not Found"` (pinned via `Shortcuts.ba_toList_eq`), matching the curl `404 Not Found`.
  * `notfound_body_wire_bytes` — the deployed 404 body is exactly the 9 bytes of
    `"not found"` (⇒ `Content-Length: 9`, curl-confirmed).
  * `deployed_404_status_line` — the full serialized status LINE of the 404 response is
    exactly the bytes of `"HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found"`.

/-! ## The deployed routing decision: an unmatched safe path 404s -/

/-- **`deployed_default_404`.** The whole deployed routing decision for a well-formed target
that matches no author route: `bestMatch` falls through the author routes to the host/glob
default, `RouteAdvanced.selectBlock` picks the `anyHost` block
(`demoVhBlocks_selectBlock_anyHost` — NOT pinned to `localhost`), and its first-matching
route is the catch-all (the glob `/health/assets/**` and `/bulk` routes both miss a single
`["nope"]` segment), so `vhandlerResponse` builds the `404`. Mirrors the deployed `/bulk`
result (`bulk_serves_large_body_any`) on the 404 branch. -/

/-! ## A concrete witness — the catch-all is genuinely reached (non-vacuity) -/

/-- A concrete routed `GET /nope` request under the plaintext listener's `localhost`
authority — the `RouteAdvanced.Req` shape `hostReqOf` builds for the curl above (a single
unmatched path segment). Built directly, mirroring `Reactor.App.bulkReq`. -/
def nopeReq : RouteAdvanced.Req :=
  { host := ["localhost"], method := "GET", segs := ["nope"], headers := [], query := [] }

/-- **`nope_dispatches`.** The REAL `RouteAdvanced.dispatch` over the deployed `demoVhBlocks`
— the exact matcher the deployed default handler runs — selects the CATCH-ALL route for a
`GET /nope` under a non-vhost authority: `selectBlock` picks `anyHost`, then first-match
routing falls past the `/health/assets/**` glob and the `/bulk` route to the catch-all. This
discharges the non-vacuity of `deployed_default_404` — the 404 branch is genuinely reachable
by concrete dispatch (mirrors `Reactor.App.bulk_dispatches`). -/
