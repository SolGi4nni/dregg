Reactor.SerializeSanitize — DEFENSE-IN-DEPTH egress: response-splitting
impossible-by-construction.

`Reactor/SerializeFaithful.lean` proved the egress DUAL of parse-faithfulness
(`serialize_faithful`, `serialize_injective` on `Response.Wf`) and, crucially,
the REAL FINDING `serialize_response_splitting`: the deployed `serialize`
renders a header value VERBATIM, so a value carrying `CR LF` forges extra header
lines on the wire (HTTP response-splitting). That vector is PROVEN-not-live only
because INGRESS rejects CR/LF (`Arena.Parse.parse_rejects_ctl_in_value`), so no
attacker CR/LF reaches egress — a `Wf`-maintenance obligation discharged by the
parser, one stage away.

This file closes the G3-egress residual in
`docs/engine/review/ENGINE-ASSURANCE-STORY.md` with BELT-AND-SUSPENDERS: a
serializer `serializeSafe` that is safe WITHOUT relying on ingress. It is a
STRICT-REJECT guard — it decides `Response.Wf` (RFC 7230 §3.2: reason phrase and
every header name/value CR/LF-free, names colon-free) and, if the response is
malformed, emits a fixed well-formed fallback (`safeError`, a headerless `500`)
INSTEAD of the attacker-controlled bytes. So its output is ALWAYS the faithful
serialization of a well-formed response — no forged header line is representable,
whatever a future stage constructs.

What is proven (all additive; `Reactor/Serialize.lean` and
`Reactor/SerializeFaithful.lean` are untouched, built ON):

* `serializeSafe_wf` — for EVERY input `resp` (even non-`Wf`), there is a
  well-formed `r` with `serializeSafe resp = serialize r`. The emitted bytes are
  always the serialization of a `Wf` response.
* `serializeSafe_faithful` — the same, spelled through `serialize_faithful`: the
  safe output is ALWAYS `rfcStatusLine r ++ rfcHeaderBlock r ++ CRLF ++ r.body`
  for a `Wf r`, i.e. exactly the RFC-7230 `status-line · (field CRLF)* · CRLF ·
  body` encoding of well-formed (CR/LF-free) fields — the only CR/LFs on the
  wire are the structural terminators, so NO attacker-forged header line exists.
* `serializeSafe_faithful_on_wf` — on already-`Wf` responses, `serializeSafe =
  serialize` BYTE-IDENTICALLY. Wiring it changes NOTHING for well-formed
  responses (the whole deployed traffic), so it is a safe drop-in.
* Non-vacuity — `serializeSafe_prevents_split`: on the concrete `splitInjected`
  (CR/LF-in-value) that plain `serialize` splits (`serialize splitInjected =
  serialize splitHonest`, from `SerializeFaithful`), `serializeSafe` does NOT
  emit those forged bytes — it routes to `safeError`. Witnessed by literal wire
  bytes (`serialize_splitInjected_bytes`, `serialize_safeError_bytes`).

WIRING NOTE (NOT done this pass — `Reactor/Dataplane.lean` is another lane):
the deployed egress call site invokes `Reactor.serialize` (via
`serialize_eq_fast` / `SerializeFast`). To install this defense-in-depth,
replace that call with `Reactor.serializeSafe`. `serializeSafe_faithful_on_wf`
proves this is byte-identical on every `Wf` response, so it is a behavior-
preserving swap for well-formed traffic and a strict reject for the (currently
ingress-blocked) malformed case. A `serializeSafe`-vs-fast twin (the analogue of
`serialize_eq_fast`) would follow for the compiled path.

HONEST SCOPE: the live splitting vector is ALREADY mitigated at ingress; this is
defense-in-depth (belt-and-suspenders), not the fix of a live vuln.
