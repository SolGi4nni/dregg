# Reactor.Serve — a per-request test view that drives the *proven* reactor

The response half is entirely proven model code — not the hand-interpolated
`s!`-glue that would leave response bytes outside the model. `serve : Bytes → Bytes`
is a single-request test view whose response path is entirely proven model code:

1. The input bytes are wrapped as one completion event `RingEvent.recvInto 0 bytes`
   (a recv completion whose buffer contents are already materialized — the
   copy-once altitude of `Reactor.Contract`).
2. `Reactor.step demoConfig (active mkPlain) event` runs the *proven* reactor: the
   FSM (`Proto.step`) parses via the arena-backed `demoConfig.h1Parse` (proven to
   carry the resolved request head, `Reactor.Config.h1Parse_complete_content`) and
   emits outputs, which the reactor translates to submissions.
3. The response `Bytes` are produced from those submissions by the *proven*
   serializer (`Reactor.serialize`): a `dispatch req` is answered by the *real*
   application layer — `Reactor.App.handle demoApp req` drives `Route.Match.bestMatch`
   over a concrete route table (`GET /health → 200`, everything else → `404`), not a
   hardcoded 200; an empty submission list becomes a canned `400`. There is no
   `s!`-interpolation on the response path — every response byte is `serialize resp`
   for a `Response` value, so the framing is `serialize_framing` by construction.

The end-to-end fact is `serve_wf`: for *any* input, `serve` returns a well-formed
HTTP response — its bytes decompose exactly as
`statusLine ++ CRLF ++ headerBlock ++ CRLF ++ CRLF ++ body` (the serializer's
`serialize_framing`, lifted through the reactor).

flowed through the proven parse → FSM → reactor, concatenated with fixed literal

431, or an application send — and `serve` forwards them faithfully, never
rewriting the FSM's status decision: a 431 stays a 431; pipelined sends
concatenate in order. Because the canned
responses are serializer-built (`Config.badRequest400`/`oversize431` =
`serialize …`), each forwarded chunk still carries `serialize_framing`. -/

/-- The demo application configuration `serve` routes against: the concrete

layer's seam theorems (`app_routes_total`, `app_chosen_route_matches`) are proven
about — the routing is driven, not a hardcode. -/

default) — no hardcoded status. Used ONLY when the FSM emitted no response bytes;
it never overrides an FSM send. An empty submission list is the malformed path
(canned 400). -/

/-! ## Theorems -/

/-- **Faithful forwarding.** When the FSM emits response bytes, `serve` returns
exactly their in-order concatenation — the FSM's own decided responses (a canned
400/431, an application send, pipelined sends), never a rewritten status.
`serve` does not replace a 431 with a synthesized 400. -/
theorem serve_faithful (input : Bytes) (h : sendsOf (reactorSubs input) ≠ []) :
    serve input = (sendsOf (reactorSubs input)).flatten := by
  unfold serve
  cases hs : sendsOf (reactorSubs input) with
  | nil => exact absurd hs h
  | cons a t => rfl

/-- **Demo-path well-formedness.** When the FSM emits no response of its own,
`serve` returns a well-formed HTTP response: its bytes decompose as
`statusLine ++ CRLF ++ headerBlock ++ CRLF ++ CRLF ++ body`. This is the
serializer's `serialize_framing` on the demo response — proven framing, no
`s!`-glue. (The forwarded-send path carries framing via the serializer-built
canned responses; see `sendsOf`.) -/
theorem serve_demo_wf (input : Bytes) (h : sendsOf (reactorSubs input) = []) :
    serve input
      = statusLineOf (demoResp (reactorSubs input)) ++ crlf
          ++ headerBlockOf (demoResp (reactorSubs input)) ++ crlf ++ crlf
          ++ (demoResp (reactorSubs input)).body := by
  unfold serve
  rw [h]
  exact serialize_framing (demoResp (reactorSubs input))

/-- **Routing is what serve does — the App seam, wired into the reactor.** When
the FSM parses a request and emits no response of its own (`sendsOf = []`, a bare
`dispatch req` heading the submission list), the served bytes are exactly
`serialize (App.handle demoAppConfig req)` — the real application layer over the
concrete demo route table, not a hardcoded status. Composed with the App layer's
`app_routes_total`, this response is `responseOfHandler` of the route that
`Route.Match.bestMatch` actually selected (see `serve_routes_bestMatch`). -/
theorem serve_routes (input : Bytes) (req : Proto.Request) (rest : List RingSubmission)
    (hsends : sendsOf (reactorSubs input) = [])
    (hsub : reactorSubs input = .dispatch req :: rest) :
    serve input = serialize (App.handle demoAppConfig req) := by
  unfold serve
  rw [hsends, hsub]
  rfl

/-- **The routing decision is `bestMatch`'s, all the way to the wire.** The
served bytes for a dispatched request serialize the response of the route the
*real* `Route.Match.bestMatch` chose over the effective table — a `serve` that
ignored the router (a hardcoded 200) would fail this. This lifts the App layer's
`app_routes_total` seam through `serve`. -/
theorem serve_routes_bestMatch (input : Bytes) (req : Proto.Request)
    (rest : List RingSubmission)
    (hsends : sendsOf (reactorSubs input) = [])
    (hsub : reactorSubs input = .dispatch req :: rest) :
    ∃ r, Route.Match.bestMatch demoAppConfig.table
            (App.targetSegments req.target) = some r
       ∧ serve input = serialize (App.responseOfReq req r.handler) := by
  obtain ⟨r, hbest, hhandle⟩ := App.app_routes_total demoAppConfig req
  exact ⟨r, hbest, by rw [serve_routes input req rest hsends hsub, hhandle]⟩

/-! **Totality is not a theorem in Lean.** `serve : Bytes → Bytes` is a plain `def`, so
totality is a TYPE-LEVEL fact — the elaborator admits no partial `def` of that
signature, and there is nothing left to prove. The theorem that stood here,
`serve_total : serve input = serve input`, was exactly that non-statement:
it holds of EVERY function of the same arity, so it constrained `serve` not at
all while wearing a name that claimed it did. The real facts about `serve` are `serve_routes` and `serve_dispatches` above. -/
