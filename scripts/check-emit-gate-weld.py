"""check-emit-gate-weld.py — THE CROSS-LANGUAGE WELD GATE for the emit-gate pairs.

Each `circuit-prove/tests/*_emit_gate.rs` embeds a GOLDEN_JSON string literal that is
DOCUMENTED as byte-identical to a `#guard emitVmJson2 <desc> == "..."` (or v1
`emitJson`/`emitVmJson`) string in a `metatheory/Dregg2/Circuit/Emit/*.lean` file.
The Lean `#guard` pins the Lean side (checked at `lake build` time); the Rust test
pins the Rust side (checked at `cargo test` time). But NOTHING EXECUTABLE compared
the two literals to each other: each side is welded only to itself, so the pair can
drift while both stay green — a gate comparing two checked-in copies of the same
claim validates nothing about their agreement.

This script closes that seam STATICALLY (no lake, no cargo, <1s):
  1. For every emit-gate Rust file, extract each raw-string descriptor literal
     (r#"{"name":...}"#) and parse its "name".
  2. Collect the AUTHORITATIVE pins: every #guard-pinned JSON string in the Lean
     tree (Lean escaped string literals whose payload parses as a descriptor with
     a "name"), plus every `circuit/descriptors/**.json` artifact (those are
     generate-fresh-gated by scripts/check-descriptor-drift.sh, so byte-equality
     to one of them inherits that gate).
  3. For each Rust golden, find a pin with the same descriptor name and require
     BYTE EQUALITY.

Exit 0 = every Rust golden is byte-identical to an authoritative pin.
Exit 1 = a drifted pair (named on both sides, bytes differ) or a Rust golden with
         no pin anywhere (an unwelded golden — its gate certifies only itself).

A drifted pair means one side moved and the other kept certifying the old bytes —
exactly the silent divergence the emit gates claim ("neither can silently diverge")
but could not themselves enforce.

Also prints (informational, non-gating) the reverse gap: Lean #guard-pinned
descriptor names with NO Rust-side counterpart at all (neither a test golden nor
a checked-in artifact) — Lean-emitted descriptors nothing on the Rust side
validates against.

# golden on the PRODUCTION injection-leg path (`injection_descriptor()` -> `.expect(…)`), and the

# descriptor as having "NO Rust-side counterpart" while a Rust-side counterpart was panicking two
# directories away. A weld gate that scans only tests measures where the goldens are TIDY, not
# where they are LOAD-BEARING. Every `.rs` under a `src/` tree is scanned now, on the same terms.

#
# — a `concat!` of ESCAPED fragments, not a raw string; a PREFIX, not a parseable object. Every one
# of this gate's three structural requirements missed it (`r#"…"#`, starts with `{`, survives
# `json.loads`), and so did `mirror_gates.py` and `classify_descriptor_drift.py`, for the same
# reason. HEAD emitted 3826 after the 2026-08-01 KEY NONET; the literal said 3804; `strip_prefix`
# returned `None`; the test panicked at RUN TIME while `cargo check --all-targets` stayed green for
# five days. A number inside a string literal is invisible to every type check we have.
#
# So: find EVERY `trace_width` / `public_input_count` spelled with a number in Rust source,

# actually carries — by descriptor name where the fragment names one, by existence otherwise.
# ⚑ THE QUOTE IS LOAD-BEARING. `\"trace_width\":1811` is a number inside a STRING (invisible to
