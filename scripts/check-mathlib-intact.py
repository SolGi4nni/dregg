"""check-mathlib-intact.py — the shared Mathlib tree is present, pinned, and populated.

⚑ WHY THIS EXISTS (2026-08-09, twice in one evening). `~/src/mathlib4` was wiped
twice on this box.  `metatheory/.lake/packages/mathlib` is a SYMLINK into it, so a
wipe does not present as "a dependency is missing" — every mathlib-importing build
dies on

    object file '.../Mathlib/Algebra/Ring/Defs.olean' does not exist

which reads exactly like a proof failure.  A lane spent real time believing its own
module was broken.  Both restores cost ~10 min (`git clone --filter=blob:none` at the
pinned rev + `lake exe cache get`, 8105 oleans).  This gate turns a bogus proof error
into a one-line diagnosis.

⚠ THE KNOWN DESTROYER, and why the tree's own scripts are NOT it.  `rsync --delete`
ate this exact path on 2026-07-28 (`scripts/pbuild:636-648` records it: emptied
`metatheory/.lake/packages/mathlib`, removed `.lake/build`, 223 olean dirs -> 0).
`pbuild` was hardened afterwards with explicit `P` protect rules and is now the only
real `rsync --delete` in `scripts/` — the other matches are comments and a self-test
that simulates deletion with `rm -f`.  `reclaim-space.sh` is clean too: its `find`
has no `-L`, so it does not follow the symlink, and `rm -rf` on a symlink takes the
LINK, not the target.  MEASURED 2026-08-10.  So the destroyer is outside this repo:
an older `pbuild` on another host, another agent session, or a `lake` invocation that
takes `packages/`.  ⚑ This gate does not identify the culprit.  It makes the DAMAGE
legible at the moment it matters, which is the part that kept costing hours.

⚠ AND IT IS NOT "MAKE IT READ-ONLY".  Lake writes into this tree by design:
`lake exe cache get` populates it, an imported module the cache does not cover is
BUILT there, and a rev bump adds oleans.  A read-only bind would break the restore
path and every on-demand build.  The invariant is not immutability — it is that
LAKE writes to it and nothing else deletes through it.

⚑ MTIME PROVES NOTHING HERE, so this gate does not look at it.  `lake exe cache get`
unpacks with the cache's ORIGINAL timestamps, so a tree restored ten minutes ago
reports oleans "written" weeks back.  I read that as "nothing has touched it in three
days" before checking `.git`'s birth time and finding the clone was hours old.
Count and pin are the honest signals; age is not.

Exit 0 = intact.  Exit 1 = a finding, with what to run.
