//! Starbridge v2 — the native dregg master interface (library core).
//!
//! The headless, gpui-free heart lives here so it is `cargo test`-able and
//! reusable by both builds:
//!   * [`world`] — the embedded verified executor + live local dregg world.
//!   * [`dynamics`] — the observation/event stream of state transitions.
//!   * [`reflect`] — the uniform reflective object model the views consume.
//!   * [`surface`] / [`shell`] / [`compositor`] — the cap-first multi-SURFACE
//!     desktop shell: each dregg cell can be a cap-confined surface
//!     (apps-as-cells), the shell is a cap-first window manager over the live
//!     world, and the [`compositor`] enforces the VERIFIED-SCENE discipline
//!     (T1 non-overlap · T2 label-binding · T3 focus-exclusivity — the Lean
//!     `Dregg2.Apps.Compositor` teeth) at the pixel layer.
//!   * [`agent`] — the AGENT-ACTIVITY surface (the ADOS keystone): an agent
//!     loop's provable activity (held mandate · cap-gated turns · receipts ·
//!     authorization), rendered as a cap-gated surface cell.
//!
//!   * [`swarm`] — the SWARM COORDINATOR (A2 tool-call seam): N agent cells
//!     coordinating as confined Surface cells, with the notify-edge inbox
//!     threading async wakes (`EmitEvent` → `NotifyEdge` → drain turn) between
//!     them. Every action is cap-gated + receipted; the notify edge is async
//!     (the recipient drains in its OWN future turn, not a joint turn).
//!
//! The `native-full` binary (`src/main.rs`) wires these into the gpui cockpit.
//! The wire-contract client (`client`/`model`) lives in the binary crate for
//! the remote-node + `sel4-thin` paths.
