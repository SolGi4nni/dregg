//! lean_apply.rs — THE SWAP state-producer: reconstitute a `cell::Ledger` from the verified
//! Lean executor's produced `WireState`.
//!
//! # The authority inversion this closes
//!
//! Today the node runs the verified Lean executor (`dregg_exec_full_forest_auth` /
//! `execFullForestG`, proven sorry-free) only as a passive veto-only SHADOW: the FFI produces a
//! full post-state, but `decode_shadow_verdict` keeps only `{committed, loglen, status}` and the
//! node commits the post-state the LEGACY Rust `TurnExecutor` produced. The verified executor is
//! never the state PRODUCER.
//!
//! The missing mechanism — which `dregg-lean-ffi/src/marshal.rs` names as "the biggest gap" — is a
//! `WireState → cell::Ledger` extractor. This module is that extractor. `dregg_lean_ffi`'s
//! `decode_shadow_state` now keeps the post-state `WireState`; here we map it back onto real
//! `CellId`s and reconstitute the authoritative ledger, so the verified executor's output can BE
//! the committed state.
//!
//! # The id seam
//!
//! The wire carries cells by a `u64` Nat (`marshal::cell_id_to_nat`'s codomain). The pre-state
//! snapshot assigned each referenced `CellId` a Nat via the SAME deterministic sorted scheme the
//! shadow marshaller uses (`lean_shadow::collect_id_map`). We invert that map (Nat → `CellId`) to
//! put the produced balances/nonces/fields back on the right cells. A produced cell whose Nat is
//! not in the inverse map is a marshaller gap (a created cell with a fresh, above-range Nat) and is
//! reported, never silently dropped.
//!
//! # Root computation (deliberately Rust-side)
//!
//! Lean produces the STATE; the EXISTING Rust hashing (`Ledger::root` / `hash_cell` =
//! `compute_canonical_state_commitment`) computes the commitment. We do NOT ask Lean to compute the
//! root — root-scheme unification is a separate later task. Here: Lean produces the cells, Rust
//! hashes them.
//!
//! # What the cell commitment binds — and the wire-model swap-gaps it reveals
//!
//! `compute_canonical_state_commitment` hashes, per cell:
//! `(balance, nonce, fields[0..8], permissions, verification_key, cap_root, lifecycle, program)`.
//! So for the Lean-produced ledger's `.root()` to equal the Rust-produced one, the reconstitution
//! must install the post-state of EVERY one of those that an effect can touch. The verified
//! `WireState` carries enough to reconstitute:
//!   * `balance` (via the per-asset `bal` side-table) — Transfer / Burn;
//!   * `nonce`, `fields[0..8]` (the cell record) — SetField / IncrementNonce;
//!   * `cap_root` (via the `caps` side-table → [`rebuild_capabilities`]) — best-effort, lossy.
//!
//! The `WireState` does NOT carry, and the reconstitution therefore CANNOT reproduce against a
//! mutated Rust post-state (these are genuine SWAP-GAPS, surfaced by the differential, NOT hidden):
//!   * **`lifecycle`** — the wire cell record has no lifecycle field. CellSeal / CellUnseal /
//!     CellDestroy mutate `lifecycle` in Rust → `.root()` diverges. The reconstitution carries the
//!     template lifecycle FORWARD (unchanged), so the divergence is exact and detectable.
//!   * **`permissions`** — the wire `setperms` arm carries a collapsed scalar; the produced
//!     `WireState` does not echo the full `Permissions` struct, so SetPermissions diverges.
//!   * **`verification_key`** — likewise, `setvk` carries a collapsed scalar.
//!   * **cap fidelity** — the wire `caps` model is `(target[, rights])` per edge; the Rust
//!     `cap_root` hashes `(target, slot, permissions, breadstuff, expires_at, allowed_effects)`, so
//!     a real GrantCapability's `cap_root` diverges (see [`rebuild_capabilities`]).
//!
//! Off-cell-commitment side-tables — escrows, queues, swiss, nullifiers, commitments — do NOT feed
//! `cell::Ledger::root()` at all (the Rust `TurnExecutor` keeps them OUTSIDE the `Ledger`), so an
//! escrow/queue/note effect's cell-ledger reconstitution agrees on `.root()` as long as it leaves
//! the touched CELLS' commitment fields unchanged — which they do (those effects are bal/structural,
//! not cell-scalar). The differential exercises a representative turn per family to pin exactly
//! which families round-trip and which are gaps.
