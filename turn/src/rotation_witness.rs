//! # `rotation_witness` — the per-turn ROTATION producers (the deferred long pole).
//!
//! `.docs-history-noclaude/ROTATION-CUTOVER.md` §5 items 3-5 name three witness columns of the rotated
//! state block that no v1 column carries, and that no producer existed for: `cells_root`
//! (the turn-level boundary view over present cells), `iroot` (the root over the
//! receipt log — whole-history non-omission, Lean
//! `Dregg2.Lightclient.ReceiptChain8.rchain8_binds_or_collides` /
//! `metatheory/Dregg2/Lightclient/ReceiptChain8.lean`), and the `lifecycle` / `epoch` scalar limbs.
//!
//! ⚠ That citation read `mroot_injective` / `Dregg2/Lightclient/MMR.lean` until 2026-08-01, and both
//! halves were false: the theorem had been DELETED on 2026-07-28 as pigeonhole-false, and `iroot` is
//! a left-leaning chain, not the MMR's bagged peak forest. See [`iroot8`].
//!
//! The cutover doc is explicit that these were DELIBERATELY UNBUILT: a producer is only
//! validatable against the rotated trace builder that consumes it, and that builder is the
//! flip's act. THIS module is that producer, built TOGETHER with its consumer (the
//! circuit-side rotated trace builder + the cell≡circuit differential in
//! `circuit/tests/effect_vm_rotation_flip.rs`): the producer derives the limbs from the
//! REAL executed turn's `RecordKernelState` (`Ledger` after-state + the receipt-hash log),
//! the differential proves the limbs it derives EQUAL the limbs the circuit trace carries,
//! and the rotated transfer descriptor (`transferVmDescriptor2R24`) proves+verifies over a
//! trace welded to exactly these values.
//!
//! ## The rotated block (R = 24, CONFIRMED — `ROTATION-CUTOVER.md` §2b)
//!
//! The 32 pre-iroot limbs ride in the absorption order the Lean keystone
//! (`EffectVmEmitRotationV3.preLimbsAt`, `EffectVmEmitRotationR.wireCommitR`) pins:
//!
//! ```text
//!   cells_root · r0..r23 · cap_root · nullifier_root · commitments_root · heap_root
//!              · lifecycle · epoch · committed_height · iroot   (LAST)
//! ```
//!
//! The register file welds where the datum already lives in the v1 state block
//! (`EffectVmEmitRotationV3.weldsAt`): `r0 ↔ balance_lo` · `r1 ↔ nonce` · `r2 ↔ balance_hi`
//! · `r3..r10 ↔ fields[0..7]` · `cap_root ↔ cap_root`. The producer fills those welded
//! limbs with the SAME felt encodings the v1 trace uses (`split_u64`, `BabyBear::new`), so
//! the rotated trace's weld gates `colEq` are satisfied by construction; the remaining
//! limbs (`cells_root`, the map roots, `lifecycle`, `epoch`, `committed_height`, `iroot`,
//! and `r11..r23`) are witness-carried and commitment-bound — THIS module produces them.
//!
//! ## Honest boundary notes
//!
//! * The `iroot` is a left-leaning Poseidon2 fold over the per-position receipt leaves — the Rust
//!   twin of Lean `ReceiptChain8.rchain8`, whose `rchain8_binds_or_collides` makes
//!   tamper/truncate/extend/reorder all move at **2^123.63**, unconditionally (no `Compress8CR`,
//!   no `Poseidon2SpongeCR` — both refuted at deployed parameters). ⚠ This note used to cite
//!   `mroot_injective` (`MMR.lean:313`) and to call the fold an MMR; the theorem was deleted
//!   2026-07-28 and the fold is not an MMR. ⚠ The value that reaches the wire is still lane 0 —
//!   see [`IROOT_LANES_1_TO_7_UNABSORBED`], which is the one number to read before citing this
//!   root's strength at the anchor.
//! * `cells_root` is the sorted-Poseidon2 boundary root over the present cells' existence
//!   leaves (`dregg_circuit::heap_root` — the SAME tree the heap domain commits to), the
//!   `boundary_root_derived` analogue at the turn level (`UNIVERSAL-MEMORY.md`).
//! * The per-cell scalar limbs (balance/nonce/fields/cap_root/lifecycle/epoch/height)
//!   read a SINGLE cell's `RecordKernelState` — the rotated per-effect descriptor is a
//!   per-cell shape (the v1 state block is one cell's before/after). The turn-level
//!   `cells_root` and `iroot` are the same for every effect row of the turn.

///   still carry. Correct for a node.
/// * A **key/encoding** needs injectivity: distinct ids must not share a leaf AT ALL, at any
///   root width. No collision bound achieves that; only an injection does. And no 8-lane
///   encoding of 32 bytes exists — `P^8 = 2^247.26 < 2^256` is pigeonhole, proved in Lean as

///
/// The sixteen-`u16` codec (`exact_nullifier_aafi::raw_to_u16_le`) is `65536^16 = 2^256` **on the
