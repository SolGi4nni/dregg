//! **WOUND #23 FALSIFIER — the present-cell-set collision that DID and no longer DOES conflate the
//! deployed consensus anchor.**
//!
//! `docs/WOUND-felt-width-boundaries-2026-07-19.md` #23: `cells_root` was a ONE-felt (~31-bit)
//! sorted-heap existence fold over the WHOLE present-cell set, riding as a bare `BabyBear` at
//! `pre[0]` inside `compute_canonical_state_commitment_v9_felt8` — the faithful 8-felt chain the
//! executor signs as `pre_state_hash` / `post_state_hash` and the federation receipt QC aggregates
//! over. The completion lanes for a wide `cells_root` (limbs 169..=175) were already in the verified
//! layout (`RotatedLayout.rotated178`'s `.cells` group) and were ZERO in both producers, filled only
//! by the createCell trace generator. So on every non-birth turn the committed boundary view of the
//! ledger was one felt: two DIFFERENT present-cell sets colliding on that fold gave ONE signed
//! anchor for two different ledgers.
//!
//! This file is the falsification, in the exact both-polarity form the felt-width campaign requires:
//! a pair of present-cell sets that COLLIDE on the old lane-0 fold and are SEPARATED by the new
//! 8-felt group. Both polarities are asserted on the DEPLOYED entry points
//! (`state_commit::consensus_state_commitment` and `absent_cell_commitment`), against a verbatim
//! reconstruction of the pre-fix producer shape (lane 0 = the narrow fold, completion lanes zero).
//!
//! ## Why the pair is a baked-in fixture and not a live grind
//!
//! Finding it is a ~2^15.5 birthday search over BabyBear (`p < 2^31`) — cheap in absolute terms but
//! not a per-CI-run cost. [`search_cells_root_lane0_collision`] is the search that produced the
//! fixture, kept `#[ignore]`d and runnable (`cargo test -p dregg-turn --release --test
//! cells_root_width_falsification -- --ignored --nocapture`) so the fixture is reproducible rather
//! than asserted. That the search terminates in ~2^16 tries with ZERO chain interaction is itself
//! the price of the wound: `CellId::derive_raw` is BLAKE3 over attacker-chosen
//! `(public_key, token_id)`, so candidate ids are ground entirely offline.
//!
//! ## What this does NOT close (read before citing it)
//!
//! The widening makes the ROOT faithful at every intermediate (`HeapLeaf::digest8` leaves,
//! `heap_node8` nodes — no ~31-bit waist anywhere in the fold, so this is not
//! `finalSqueezeOnly_still_conflates`). It does NOT widen the tree's KEYS: a leaf address is
//! `heap_addr(CELLS_COLLECTION, hash_bytes(id))`, one felt per 32-byte `CellId`. Two ids whose key
//! folds collide give literally the SAME leaf at ANY root width — that is the accumulator-KEY class
//! (kind D: #5/#9/#11/#20), which rides the `MapOp` key epoch. The search below therefore REFUSES a
//! candidate whose key collides with the anchor cell's, so the fixture is a genuine root collision
//! over distinct leaf sets and not a disguised key collision.
