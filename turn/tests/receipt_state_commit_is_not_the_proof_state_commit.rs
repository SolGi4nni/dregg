//! ⚑ **THE MEASUREMENT THAT DECIDES WHAT A PER-TURN ANCHOR CAN AND CANNOT BIND.**
//!
//! `docs/DESIGN-pi-authority.md` §4(a) proposed publishing "the canonical 8-felt
//! `old_commit`/`new_commit` for a turn (from the node's own committed state, which it has)" so
//! that `verify_full_turn_bound`'s two endpoint `CommitmentMismatch` teeth stop comparing
//! `x != x`. The node's committed state DOES hold a per-turn 8-felt commit pair — the receipt's
//! `pre_state_hash` / `post_state_hash`, which the committee's attestation signature transitively
//! covers via `receipt_stream_root`.
//!
//! **It is not the pair the full-turn proof publishes.** This file measures that, and isolates
//! the causes, each independently sufficient.
//!
//! ## ⚠ THERE ARE FOUR, NOT TWO — corrected 2026-08-07 by direct read of the producers
//!
//! Every doc in the tree that describes this divergence (this file's own header until now,
//! `federation/src/turn_anchor.rs`, `node/src/api.rs`'s `/anchor` docblock,
//! `discord-bot/src/commands/proof_verify.rs`, `docs/DESIGN-pi-authority.md` §4(a)) names TWO
//! causes. There are four fields of `V9RotationContext` on which the two sides disagree, and the
//! two that were missing are the ones that make the alignment cost what it costs:
//!
//! 1. **`iroot`.** `state_commit::consensus_ctx` pins `rotation_witness::empty_iroot()`
//!    deliberately (a receipt cannot bind a commitment its own hash is computed from). The
//!    proof side folds something — and **which** something is not one convention but THREE, see
//!    below.
//! 2. **`cells_root` (scope).** `consensus_ctx` folds `rotation_witness::cells_root(ledger)` over
//!    the WHOLE ledger. The proof-side builder
//!    (`node::turn_proving::rotation_witness_for_self_sovereign_impl`) folds a SINGLE-CELL context
//!    ledger holding only the actor.
//! 3. **`revoked_root`.** ⚑ NOT PREVIOUSLY NAMED ANYWHERE. `TurnExecutor::consensus_state_commitment`
//!    passes the executor's LIVE `note_revoked.lock().root8()`;
//!    `rotation_witness_for_self_sovereign_impl` passes
//!    `rotation_witness::empty_revoked_root_8()` **unconditionally** — there is no parameter for
//!    it and no call site can thread one. So the moment ONE credential is revoked anywhere in the
//!    federation, every proof's published commit diverges from the anchor for a third,
//!    independent reason.
//! 4. **`material`.** ⚑ NOT PREVIOUSLY NAMED ANYWHERE. `consensus_ctx` hardcodes
//!    `RotationCarrierMaterial::default()`; the proof-side builders put the installed
//!    `child_vk` on the AFTER block of a `CreateCellFromFactory` turn. This one does not merely
//!    diverge — it is the cause that **cannot be aligned by moving the proving side**, because
//!    `factoryV3Carriers` publishes that octet as PI 47..54 and the executor's reconstruction
//!    anchors it from trusted state. Aligning it moves the SIGNED ANCHOR.
//!
//! ## ⚑ And the proof side's `iroot` is not one convention but three
//!
//! Measured at HEAD, the value fed to `iroot()` by each producer of a rotation witness:
//!
//! | producer | receipt log it folds |
//! |---|---|
//! | `blocklace_sync` non-spend / bearer arms (`:9239`, `:9319`) | `[receipt.receipt_hash()]` — THIS turn's receipt, a ONE-entry log |
//! | `turn_proving::rotation_witness_for_cap_less_turn` (`:1298`) | `[turn_hash]` — the TURN hash, not a receipt hash |
//! | `api.rs::…` HTTP witness route (`:4292`) | `[receipt_hash]` |
//! | `sdk::cipherclerk::prove_sovereign_turn_rotated` (`:5638`) | the agent's WHOLE prior receipt chain |
//! | `state_commit::consensus_ctx` | the EMPTY log, pinned |
//!
//! So "the proof folds the real receipt chain" — the phrasing in all four docblocks — is true of
//! exactly one of the four producers, and the one it is true of is the LEDGERLESS sovereign SDK
//! path, whose artifacts `/api/turn/{hash}/proof` never serves. The live node path folds a
//! one-entry log containing the current turn's receipt hash. `iroot` on the proof side is not a
//! commitment to a history; it is a free witness felt each producer fills differently.
//!
//! ## ⚑ WHY THAT IS ALLOWED: the AIR gates none of it
//!
//! `EffectVmEmitRotationV3.cellsRootGroupCol`'s own docstring (`metatheory/Dregg2/Circuit/Emit/
//! EffectVmEmitRotationV3.lean:2145-2155`): *"the createCell/factory/spawn trace generator still
//! OVERWRITES the whole group with its own in-circuit accounts tree, which is the object the two
//! map-ops below actually gate. **Only those three members constrain this group; on every other
//! member the lanes are absorbed by `wireCommitR` and gated by nothing.**"* And `B_IROOT` is
//! absorbed last and gated by nothing on ANY member. `trace_rotated::fill_block` copies both
//! straight out of the producer witness.
//!
//! So on 54 of the 57 registry members these limbs are **free witness values**, and the published
//! commit is whatever the producer chose to fold. That is what makes converging the PROVING side
//! onto the CONSENSUS context cost no VK rotation and no descriptor re-emit — and it is also why
//! the divergence was invisible: nothing refuses either value.
//!
//! So `dregg_federation::TurnAnchorV1` carries a committee-signed 8-felt pair that must be
//! REPORTED and must never be handed to `verify_full_turn_bound` as `expected_old_commit` — it
//! would refuse every honest proof. The anchor binds the **turn identity** instead, which every
//! effect-vm leg publishes and the verifier takes as a required argument.
//!
//! ## This test is a GATE, not a note
//!
//! It asserts the divergence, so aligning the two contexts (the real fix, priced in
//! `docs/DESIGN-pi-authority.md`) makes this file go RED and forces whoever does it to come here,
//! delete the divergence assertions, and open the endpoint binding this file's docs forbid. A
//! silent alignment is not possible.
//!
//! ⚠ And it now asserts the divergence **cause by cause**, so a partial alignment — three of the
//! four fields converged and `material` left behind, which is the shape the cheap version of this
//! work would take — goes red on the cause it left rather than staying green on the three it fixed.
